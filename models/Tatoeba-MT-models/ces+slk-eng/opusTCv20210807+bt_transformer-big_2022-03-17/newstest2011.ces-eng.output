What will he do? ČSSD in Prague doesn’t know Voldemort or the Confectionery
The new city councilors from the ČSSD will have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague council and the council.
The daily Aktuálně.cz (Aktuálně.cz) has "tested" the members of the new ČSSD council on how they know the notorious slang that has emerged at the town hall in recent years, when Prague was ruled by its current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary introduced by the Prague political elite during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém describes some of the most famous figures, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new councillors did not understand the familiar terms.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "godfather" vocabulary.
And even though he is a political veteran, councilman Karel Březina reacted similarly.
For example, the term "golf hole".
“It’s the only word I use sometimes.”
“I don’t understand slang in general.”
From a glossary published by Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editors selected six examples, mostly those that are notoriously connected with the Prague City Hall.
Socialists were to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the patisserie", "bull's neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "metal plating".
The three councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is supposed to head Prague's education system in the future - first promised the interview, but later did not answer the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused to take the test.
"I don't care about those things, and I won't judge how the Democrats are amusing themselves."
"I'm trying to figure out how we're going to understand each other in our programs," he said.
As already mentioned, councilman Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognized in the headline above that he was talking about an influential businessman and friend of Bém’s ex-prime minister Roman Janoušek.
"Voldemort" does not mean anything to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"That's the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, adding: "But I know that from the newspapers."
“I’m going to have to pay for a language course,” he joked.
As a tunnel Blanka, the golf hole is then decrypted not only by matador Karel Březina, but also by environmental councilor Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plachý is also familiar with where to find this character - he senses the meaning of the term "go to the candy store".
"I think it means going to some Prague business," Plachý is close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In common with Březina, he recalls that he drew his knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to test participants, there is no such well-known glossary of slang terms.
"I've consulted with colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We prefer to call ourselves names, sometimes abbreviations and misspellings of names are used," says ČSSD chairman Petr Hulínský, who is nicknamed Hulda by party members.
"At school I was called Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me Bříza," admits Karel Březina.
The daily Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and it works.
Alderman Weinert is for party members Grandpa or less friendly Dědek, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by fraud in sponsoring the party, has a nickname "Igráček" in some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing that social democrats allow in intra-party speech.
Hulínský does not like to hear Huldu, but the daily Aktuálně.cz has also recorded another nickname of this Prague chairman.
The "doctor of baton law" is said to recall that Petr Hulínský obtained his JUDr. degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
Government wants to curb torture of 'witches', publishes pamphlet
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several common characteristics.
Rather, they belong to the older generation, they cannot participate in work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
The one who "becomes" the witch is sent into isolation so as not to endanger the rest of the village.
"A man's fate is very rare."
“They don’t push young healthy women away either, because they help at work and give birth to children,” said the nun, who takes care of more than 100 women in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measures".
She has published an information booklet to help curb the witch hunt.
There's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," Die Standard said in a statement.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which borders Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after being tortured by three women and two men, doused with kerosene and set on fire.
The BBC reported on the case.
The perpetrators say it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, an oil was ignited on the woman, which is used for ritual anointing.
He said the group was trying to "drive out the evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “Eating human souls has always been a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government is trying to soften the witch hunt, in Gambia, the president himself participated in it last year.
"Gambia's President Jammi launched a sweeping witch hunt after his aunt's death, allegedly to have been involved in her death and to try to kill the president himself with black magic."
"He called in shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's personal security, forcibly escorted randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in a report.
On the farm, the trapped people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were finally released.
Bakala's tenant: He's drowning in the stove, higher rent signed
An elderly man stepped out of the door of the client center of the company RPG Byty "uhlobaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a folder and in it new leases to three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son, who is in prison.
All three of them just got their rent up.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay CZK 4100 for a 2+1 apartment of the second category from next year.
"And that's not hot water, and it has to be heated with kerosene," the man points his finger in his son's new contract, which he has full power to sign.
"But I signed it," he explains half angrily and half resignedly.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which has described the new lease terms as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when it will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man just waved his hand at it.
"One says it, the other it," he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a big laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic are waiting.
That’s why we decided to visit the “laboratory” in person.
Havířov RPG waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and on Tuesday at nine in the morning it is already full.
Right next to the door is a security guard from the security agency and a distress call.
"Hire 2011" is lit a special button on his touch screen.
One tap and a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You will not even be able to read "157" and your number is beeping on the large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
It's your turn in half a second.
After a while, an older married couple comes to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room obviously does not concern the new leases at all.
Most people come to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance claims and the like.
Letters with new leases have been delivered to mailboxes in Ostrava by most of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio since mid-November.
RPG Flats suggests in their letters to them a rent increase of 15 to 38 percent.
A special counter for new leases was opened at the client center on November 18.
"It's been running for over a week, so it's just in the run-up," workers behind the counter respond after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining flats are a local hot topic.
Prior to the election, Deputy Speaker of the Parliament and Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek from ČSSD took it quite loudly, and even now it is full of local newspapers.
"Twenty years later, I want a new floor."
“They didn’t change a board in my bathroom,” said the man at the beginning.
Most of the time, pensioners come to see if they get a discount on rent if they sign in time, as the RPG in a special offer promises.
Half discount on February rent will also be given to other tenants who sign the new contract by December 15.
However, the "deregulation" counter in Havířov is not overloaded with questions.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, there were only about 40 to 50 people here because of the 2011 rent," estimate the workers behind the counter.
RPG on the web and its boards proposes individual contract negotiation where it is needed.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
“This is not a threat, it is information about the only possible and entirely legitimate legal process,” RPG wrote on its website.
"No one will be able to sue here," one of the RPG Byty workers thinks, and the man on the street in front of the client center agrees with her in part.
“I have a 13,000 pension and 5,000 food left, and I don’t have time to judge,” he said.
But the workers are still worried.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
Rent regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent is still not even the amount necessary for simple maintenance of the housing stock," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that the neglected housing stock is the main reason, according to the homeowners, for the increase in rents.
In the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest $4 billion in apartments, while in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be $5.2 billion.
Meanwhile, a large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Havířov waiting room repeats some red highlighted information.
"The 2011 rent increase of 15% or less applies to 31,200 apartments, that's more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most by 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," it appears on the screen.
With only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio, rents will increase by 38 percent.
"This is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square metre," the RPG points out.
For 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive out rents by leaps and bounds, but will be spread out over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see the graph) will put the company back into apartments, mainly in thermal savings - new windows and insulation.
They are to be given priority by the people who sign the lease increase agreement.
There is also a school, according to the architects.
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect that it would also hide a mini-kindergarten with all that goes with it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a pile of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it can be visited by children of Arch.Design employees.
Arch.Design, a design-architectural company from whose studios a number of significant Brno buildings emerged, has been counting on space for its company mini-kindergarten since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
The company employs nearly 90 people, most of them baby boomers, and it was important for women designers and architects to be able to return to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of part-time work, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers its employees as part of a social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine demanding employment with child care.
The mini-kindergarten was created by Arch.Design employees themselves and with the support of the management they managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-kindergarten is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (subsidies amounting to CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified personnel and operation for two years.
After exhausting the financial subsidy (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to run a mini-kindergarten for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project took one year and Economy Rating significantly helped with the application for the subsidy.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the children are cared for by a nurse and a kindergarten teacher all day long, so children without age restrictions can go to kindergarten, but most of them are older than 3 years.
Because it is a "mini-kindergarten", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but there will be more during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of the parents, and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten, regardless of the hierarchy of the position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with a quality education - from basic learning to preparation for school desks, the English language is also taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check on their child at any time, and there are no stressful situations with delayed picking up children from kindergartens away from the parents' workplace.
Parents are more productive with their working hours.
It is no wonder that there is a naturally loyal employee-employer relationship.
Arch.Design is one of the Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personnel marketing.
The House of Bones continues to fascinate even after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the backbone of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Thanks to its organic shapes, the house has earned the nickname House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, tile and mosaic fragments, a facade resembling scales and ubiquitous soft curves are all typical of the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudí.
The facade of the house plays out dream lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
Detailed observation shows the geometry, rhythm and precisely thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the houses sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the brilliance of colors is even more enhanced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes appears equally in the interiors.
Wood in waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, peepholes and moldings.
House Batlló, which stands in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was created by the reconstruction of the house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sal Cortes.
Reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old structure and building an entirely new one, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper redevelopment.
The apartment house Casa Batlló was not designed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
It was designed by architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his design board that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade.
Many other artists and artists have also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the design of the Casa Batlló house started a successful collaboration between Jujol and Gaudí.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Milá and the Park of Guell, which contains Gaudi's other works.
From the locals, the house soon after its completion earned the nickname "House of Bones" due to its organic shapes.
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it "the yawning house".
It is also said that the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted at the top of the structure.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Their 45-degree inclination may seem bizarre.
In the creation of Gaudí, he absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not let them bind him.
At the beginning of the construction, he received a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, the city council was horrified by the result and asked for correction.
For example, the council was bothered by the fact that the building also encroached on the pillars of the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, only fifteen days after the appeal of the municipal district, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to lease the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon and on the third floor a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house intersects the staircase, through which you can climb to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening lounge doors, and the larger company can communicate with each other comfortably, without at the same time retaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facade, the house with Gaudí’s reconstruction also received an unconventional roofing and two extra floors.
Gaudí’s play with the light, blue and white glazed tiles facing the inner courtyard and skylights is also impressive.
The game of two colors gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
Simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which in turn absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and opulent apartment open to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed with the tours because they found it to be a very profitable business and in addition, they expanded the tours to include common and attic spaces, including a roof terrace.
The entrance fee to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes have a 20% discount.
The amount greatly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to experience the true atmosphere of a house with dragon turrets, you need to quickly make friends with one of the residents of the apartment building and visit it right at home.
How to choose a mattress and grate: women have different requirements than men
Not a flashy bed frame, but the quality of the sleeping area, that is, the mattress and the grate, give the basis for a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complemented to suit a particular user.
When choosing, a lot of things are decided, from weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior into which the mattress and grate are made.
Typical example?
For example, latex mattresses are not suitable for weekend cottages where they do not regularly heat up, because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
However, it is necessary to turn them regularly.
If they don’t have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they’re still lying on a solid board, they’re retaining moisture: There could be mold underneath.
Habits also determine the choice.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
"I hope all the hockey players who were coming back from the NHL complained to me that they weren't going to sleep here."
"They needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam for their battered shoulders, heels and hips."
“These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misread the ‘information’ from their joints and skin,” explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, were looking for mattresses with lazy foam years ago.
"Today it's fine, suitable mattresses have for example Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL player to appreciate the sluggish foam.
This “miracle” is simple.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
There is no pressure, you will not roll over at night like after a hard match.
You'll just sleep better.
Lazy foam also acts as a protection against bedsores.
When choosing a mattress size, add the length of the foot to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women with a height of around 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for bed width is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," advises Helena Prokopová, the Guild of Upholsterers and Decorators, who has been dealing with the issue of healthy sleeping and furniture ergonomics for many years and has been lecturing her at professional schools.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own grate and mattress, but here be careful when buying to match the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, there will be nothing left but to mount the gratings to different heights, but you may not succeed with each bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the shaping and loosening layer.
"When touching your hands or sitting on the mattress, you definitely mustn't feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grid.
Full-upholstered beds, where the mattress and base are like conjoined Siamese twins, have no place in the bedrooms.
Mattresses poorly ventilate, you can not wash their cover, which is already common today.
And because we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will start to resemble one large (and clogged) sieve.
Therefore, experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses up to 25 years, or even lifetime warranty.
But everything has its buts.
That’s why the advice from the retailers: do not give up on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and washable coating, but rather add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers with slide fasteners all around the perimeter are commonly produced today, so we get two parts after opening (very important for washing and washing machine size!), yet the manipulation in larger types (and in one person) when shooting could resemble a duel of light weight in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a hardboard in your bed instead of a grate?
Never!
Maximum one-night stay on a bed.
However, keep the board (if it does not already have them) ventilated and use a mattress with a spring frame and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it.Taschenfederkern) and a layer of loosening.
Polyurethane mattress does not belong on such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (for example a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-positioning slats with 14 to 18 slats, but slats with a larger number of slats, 28 or more, where the slats are doubled in the lumbar area and their rigidity can be regulated.
There is no spring mattress on the positioning lamella grids because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to setting the stiffness of the slats, you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special attachment of the slats, which allows you to push or even tilt the slats so that the shoulder sleeps nicely.
For men who have "shoulders all over their backs", this is definitely an important thing.
It is even remembered by mattress manufacturers who have started to use the softening zone in the shoulder area.
Women also remember - they, in turn, give a softer surface in the hips.
For the most demanding customers aileron or plate gratings with so-called multitorsion suspension are designed.
The pressure is spread over more points and the tension is reduced.
However, be careful, as soon as you apply the wrong pillow (big and "enthusiastic") to the right mattress and grid, most of the "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and only extend to the shoulders with the tips so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
A suitable size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should balance (along with the shoulder cradle of the grate or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original straw-filled grasses.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least additives.
It is also a trend in mattresses.
The raw materials from the oil from which polyurethane foams are made are replaced by natural oils, such as from castor and soy.
Soy is used by all well-known manufacturers.
“The bio of mattresses means that the core is made of a material of pure natural origin,” explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also take microcapsules to release the fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There is also a division between men and women.
While men are “cooled” by birch plant extract to absorb heat and cool the body, women, on the contrary, “sink” the covers.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making the weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (has larger pores with broken cellular structure, is more breathable than ordinary polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of various stiffnesses of cold foam and "lazy" foam creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels should be.
For a quality mattress you will pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet the health parameters, have a lower VAT rate, are treated as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on a mattress and a grate is not easy.
Sometimes you can use the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with sewn memory foam in the cover for 11 990 CZK.
The second can be bought for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and high density was started by the material Tempur at a "cosmic" pace.
It was originally created as a material for NASA because the astronauts were subjected to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur softens in the heat, on the contrary, it solidifies in the cold.
It perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of bedsores, but also to increase sleeping comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special pillows under the feet, which relieve the legs and the venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and so on.
More and more parents want to monitor people, so they want to protect their children
More and more people are worried about their child being watched by GPS.
The system originally created for searching for cars can also track the movement of people, and thus help in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anna Janatkova.
The device is now about the size of a matchbox, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Anna and began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the expense of their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying, but another means to reduce the likelihood that some tragedy will happen,” said Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases such devices can be misused, for example when they are put in a bag for someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if the child does not want to wear anything similar, he will just get rid of it.
“Even very young children show a lot of creativity in how to intentionally lose things when they don’t want to be in control.”
"Big expectations were raised by mobile phones, which can be turned off just like these tracking devices," Bočková said.
It is also questionable whether such a device would really help in the event of an attack.
"When it comes to an upcoming kidnapping, the perpetrator practically always ensures that the child does not carry any electronics that could reveal his or her location."
"It's a phone now."
"When tracking devices begin to expand, they will look for them as well, as their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
“In that case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police,” she says.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if the tracking device is destroyed immediately after an attack, its presence can help.
"The device can be set to periodically send the location after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"More expensive devices also have built-in tiltometers, so even if a person just slipped and remained motionless, the device immediately sends a warning with the location," says Čech.
According to him, a similar service can be carried out by smart mobile phones with navigation, where it is enough to upload special software.
The problem with current tracking units is that they are either devices similar to matchbox-sized pendants or smaller mobile phones.
They are always at risk of losing it.
According to Pilin from Macro Weil, the device is now being tested to look like a regular digital watch.
"This will have the greatest advantage in that the potential aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll recognize them after a while and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the trackers are developed into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology that is used to monitor cars.
This is a combination of GPS location (which uses conventional auto-navigation) and the mobile phone function that reports the current position of the car.
The army has incendiary cords that would encircle the Czech Republic. But it will only last two years
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometers of cords to detonate explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence delivered 224 kilometres of cords to the warehouses.
The army has 225 years of supplies.
The problem is that the shelf life of the cords is two, maximum four years.
The army bought incendiary cords from STV Group, a. s. for CZK 40 million.
In order to justify the purchase of such a huge amount of incendiary cords, the General Staff of MF DNES wrote off the fact that soldiers use 60 kilometers of incendiary cords per year during training.
However, calculations of military pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, show that then all generals, officers in command of the army, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Minister of Defence Alexander Vondra and army commander Vlastimil Pick included.
This is the only way to justify the annual consumption of the army of sixty kilometers of fuses.
This is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were the case, the army's stockpiles would last for more than a decade.
If, on the other hand, the basic training of every new professional requires at most two meters of incendiary cord, as experts say, then the army has secured - even with increased consumption of engineering or special forces - supplies for the 225 years.
The soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade have recently personally complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for small arms, so the shootings are also limited due to the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't get it either, that they buy so many fuses from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision and they certainly know what they're up to."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we try to satisfy as traders," says Jan Děcký, Sales Manager at STV Group.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek said hundreds of kilometres of purchased ammunition would last at least a decade.
Jan Děcký of STV Group, however, talks about the four-year lifespan of the fuse box and the police or army pyrotechnics even about two years.
“With perfect storage, it could be the four of them,” says one of them, who doesn’t want to give his name as a soldier because of criticism of the military.
At the end of its life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and cost extra money.
Another argument of the Ministry is the quantity discount for 445 kilometers of incendiary cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," Pejšek said.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of the firing lines of police bomb squads, which dispose of ammunition from the Second World War or from the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order just enough to use up this ammunition before the end of its service life.
It has proven itself for the safety of pyrotechnicians, and can also be more flexible to acquire more modern and therefore more reliable cord types.
The Ministry of Defence already has significant difficulties with the disposal of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to march on the Rhine.
According to pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, in a few years awaits the same problem: it will dispose of hundreds of kilometers old fireboxes, which today "cheap" buys.
To this day, I draw on the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition
The winning place in the Tradesman of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year’s Tradesman of the Year competition was the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that quality accommodation at a reasonable price was lacking in Liberec.
From savings from foreign brigades and using bank credit, he bought a semi-detached house with five apartments.
It took a lot of courage for him to be a third-year college student.
"The ratio between the quality and price of accommodation in our country at that time did not allow me to try to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to lease to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back into the house, which he gradually converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has gradually managed to open four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
Until recently, the most comfortable of them was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, he added another one, of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisá, where we have sold our franchise concept and other people interested in the Pytloun hotel franchise are reporting," says last year's business owner number one.
"And this sale of a hotel license was largely due to the victory in the Tradesman of the Year competition," Pytloun added.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, they often congratulated me even more and I have to say it was pleasant," he recalls.
Participation in the competition is strongly recommended to all who are trying to do something.
There is no need to win, all visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances he might not have gotten anywhere else.
“I started trading regularly with some of the people I met through the competition.”
The fame associated with success, according to him, fell somewhat on every employee.
He has about 70 of them.
"I see more loyalty and pride in them being involved in something that has gained widespread recognition."
“It’s not just my personal success, it’s the result of all of us working well together.”
"Only my name is pushed to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of the victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the winner’s determination, Farmet’s bad times are over.
Last year, the owner of the company Farmet, Karel Zdarsky, came to the Slovanský House for the first prize in the last year’s Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts through which he built a company with hundreds of millions of turnovers from a small tooling workshop in Česká Skalice.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my co-workers and increased our confidence for the match with the competition," says last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s history there was a desire to do something useful.
So when the state offered to rent a small workshop to his father as compensation for the Communist confiscated property, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in the company where he worked, and with a few friends around his dad founded a company for plastic bathtubs.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company gained greater awareness even among the non-professional public after its success in the competition through the media.
“Not only did our customers begin to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they were cooperating with a company that had achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
Last year, however, was not just about the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
The award was based on the company’s financial results up to 2008 and only partially from 2009.
2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering goods.
The crisis, which had not yet affected citizens so much, was at its peak, but companies were already stopping their investment projects and beginning to restrict the purchase of new machinery and technology.
"Of course, this situation has not escaped us either."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and there were also redundancies," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable company must sometimes be able to take such unpopular measures.
However, they managed the situation and kept the company profitable, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
What they have not reduced at Farmet, however, is investment in research and development.
"We have built a research and training centre with grants, we have strengthened the presentation at international trade fairs, we have won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
A poll that removes nonsensical regulations
The survey on the Absurdity of the Year is the fourth part of the business competition.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of another year's survey, the Absurdity of the Year, was the obligation to bring documents to the office that are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the four thousand voters voted for it.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, although an official can retrieve it with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the survey, that will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register during inspections of insurance payers," said Jana Buraňová, spokesperson for the CSSZ.
To shine a light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and to abolish the nonsensical ones, is the point of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is the fourth time this year that it has been part of a business competition organized by Hospodářské noviny and is becoming increasingly popular among the public.
If there were about 3,000 voters last year, there were nearly 4,000 this year.
And it is no wonder that various legal obligations, which serve only to delay the business, are still enough with us.
"For example, in the number of documents for tax returns, we are at the forefront of the world," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Crafts of the Czech Republic.
Business simplification has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and runs according to the same script every year.
Anyone can register administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
For registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz is available. The organizer of the competition then selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote on it via the Internet in October at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year, more than a hundred, 105 regulations and regulations lacking meaning, were registered in the survey.
The tips were sent by businessmen, but also professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, there was a requirement for motorway and expressway maintenance vehicles to pay a toll, or for entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets to paint every two years.
The list of this year’s seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which personalities of political and social life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Crafts of the Czech Republic, assisted in this culmination of the competition, and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws businessmen's sticks, so my goal is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs every year that today only unnecessarily complicate business," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The effort to abolish nonsensical regulations does not sound empty.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation to report the entrepreneur three days in advance to the trade licensing office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the stand to an exhibition or fair.
This obligation was removed by the amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The second most voted duty in 2007, which was to report a business trip of up to 30 days to the Labour Office as a foreign employee, was removed by the law on the so-called green card.
Third time's the charm.
In 2009, physiotherapists were ordered to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two foot scales in their office.
This was eased this year by a decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen away.
New category appreciates socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
The fifth year of the Hospodářské noviny competition is a new category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impacts of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the promoter and guarantor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
This year’s first year of this special sub-category of the Vodafone Company of the Year 2010 main competition was attended by companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published on a separate article.
Although they differ diametrically from one another in their activities, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen nationwide finalists was Et Netera, a Prague-based software company that supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of the endowment fund sponsoring handicapped children for seventeen years.
The paper mill from Poděbrady, which has more than 70 percent of its employees, takes care of its disabled employees, and therefore won the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and ranked third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in the region.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won by introducing flexible working hours, reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title because she preferentially buys from Czech manufacturers, supports civic activities in the vicinity and saves the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least impact on the environment,” explains Miluše Ryznarová, Managing Director.
Responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí Region thinks about the health of its employees and has acquired ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local sheltered workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Romani community," said company representative Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundry and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to its employees’ pension insurance in the form of premium bonuses.
"In our country, we are again giving contributions for food, transport, qualification and recreation," says Josef Strapáč from the Bruntál construction company Czasch, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically entered into the Responsible Company of the Year category, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly filled or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
“It is not possible to register for this competition alone, as it is a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year,” explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
On the Land Fund in Pilsen police arrested during a public competition
Anti-corruption police have been arrested in the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in recent days.
Handcuffed detectives deployed a local businessman in the media sector and a real estate trader Luboš G.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate the current public tender to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would gain specific candidates.
For this, Luboš G. had to pay half a million crowns.
"So far, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for misconduct in a public contract and in a public competition," said Antonie Zelena, head of the Plzeň Public Prosecutor's Office, adding that further details could not be provided due to the ongoing investigation.
The 46-year-old man was released after 24 hours.
Given the minimum of official information, it is only possible to speculate on how he could have influenced the public tender.
When asked about the rights, Lubomír Černá, a spokesperson for the Land Fund, said that police officers had indeed made arrests at a detached workplace in Pilsen during a public tender.
“It was the client, not our employee,” she said.
According to Černá, the public tender has the correct title "Invitation to submit an offer of land transfer claims under the Land Act" and takes place in the event that more eligible applicants show interest in the offered land.
"These persons within the call offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the offered claims, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the fund spokesperson explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who had entered the call, and since he himself is also an authorized person, having purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered the interested party for the land not to participate in the competition.
He probably got a severance package for that.
That would explain why he had such a large sum of money in custody.
Luboš G. has had above-standard contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was involved in the case of former PF boss Václav Sankot, who was criminally prosecuted for giving out land on which a decision on the location of the construction had already been made.
It was then that Luboš G. acquired from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically in the place where the access road to the Borská pole industrial zone was supposed to be built.
Later, he traded them very advantageously with the municipality for a house in the historic center of the city, which had a value much higher.
At that time, the town hall had to accept it because otherwise it would have endangered the building by blocking the land.
Households will pay hundreds a month
Households will have to pay extra from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewerage, heat supply and somewhere rents will grow.
As of January, families will have to pull hundreds more crowns from their wallets each month than they do now.
Electricity will increase by 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, and in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies by a tenth, and in many cases it will also increase the supply of central heat.
The increase in electricity should cost households 100 crowns a year more than now.
All the main suppliers have lowered their electricity prices, so there is a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics.
Gas costs slightly, but at a time when people are drowning the most and have the highest consumption.
Therefore, they must also count on hundreds of extra crowns per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the country, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an extra CZK 50 per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than CZK 1,000 per year.
Prague residents are at risk of more than 9 percent more water and sewerage costs if the city increases rents from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the roast will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewerage prices are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, rents may rise significantly in 450,000 rental apartments, where regulation has been ending since January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by up to 100 percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new rent are going to take the company to court.
Regulated rents paid by people in around 300,000 apartments could rise by as much as 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which most often end up in the care of doctors drunkers who are not yet fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are repeatedly treated in the hospital.
This comes from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases in the income of children's departments of hospitals.
“Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk on them.”
"The trend is certainly hard alcohol," Luděk Pelikán, head of the children's department at Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia, told Práva.
"If they can pull the bottle out of Daddy's closet, it's probably whiskey, but fernet and vodka prevail."
"Vodka has the advantage of pouring it into the juice and not smelling so much," explained the doctor.
And Eva Jurinová, spokesperson of the Motol University Hospital, also gives him the truth.
"Most often it's fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was the plum brandy they brought from home," Jurinová said.
According to Pelikán, 13- or 14-year-olds are a fairly common phenomenon in hospital reception.
Before Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances are transporting underfed schoolchildren from a wide area.
"One girl was lying there about four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was brought to us with 3.5 per mille of extra alcohol in her blood in combination with ecstasy," the doctor said.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party."
"What's interesting is that her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the doctor said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drinking their own offspring is considered to be the main cause of growing child drinking.
However, according to experts, addiction in the true sense of the word can not be talked about in children.
"Alcoholism is defined as a chronic addiction to alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena involved, and this is not the case in children."
"Those who use alcohol repeatedly tend to have a rather poor family-social background," Pelikán explained.
According to Jurinová, about 40 children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motol this year until mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will be included in the statistics.
Child drunks who take their parents home after an outpatient treatment do not count.
Except when kids just sit down after school and drink a bottle of booze, there are three seasonal fluctuations they can count on: the witch, New Year’s Eve, and the end of the school year.
"It's either drinking the grief of a bad report card or celebrating the start of the holiday season."
"But I've seen seven child drunks at the same time," Pelikán said.
Paradoxically, a drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is in advantage over one who suffers an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose will drive away irrigation infusions with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
“They’re actually better off because they have a good awakening after that beautiful evening experience and nothing hurts them.”
"They're just confused about where they are," Pelikán admitted, adding that he sometimes spoils the patient's mood by at least listing the costs of their treatment.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed costs tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as an educational tool, when I directly calculated the cost of their drunkenness and that they could also spend the whole summer on a part-time job to earn money for that one party," added Pelikan.
However, health insurance companies do not pursue recourse procedures in cases of child drunkards in which parents would be charged with the cost of treatment.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time
Two L-159s of the five aircraft, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Seville, Spain on Tuesday, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of anyone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been abroad for exercises or show years.
It is a two-seater version of the L-159T1, which was previously operated by the Czech Army and which was airworthy.
The remaining three are L-159 single-seat aircraft.
So far, they are preserved in Aero Vodochody and the broker of the trade - Omnipol - took over them last week.
According to Jan Pejšek of the Defence Press Department, when the planes will be physically dispatched from Vodochody is not yet known.
"The L-159 single-seater jets for the exchange were separated from the long-held jets, without any further deposits and investments by the Ministry."
"The two-seater L-159T1 was exchanged in its current state and form," Pejšek said.
He added that the army would not remain without two-seater aircraft, as the ministry signed a contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 worth 200 million crowns to rebuild four unnecessary L-159 aircraft into two two-seater machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the military in July, while the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejsek, the EADS has committed to deploying the aircraft to some NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the buyer of the L-159 is EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the customer how he will implement this thing," Pejšek said.
A few days ago, the newspaper reported that the Spanish army was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not announce a tender for the purchase and approached EADS directly.
At the time, the defense leadership argued that it would support future exports of the L-159 abroad in exchange.
The Czech Army bought 72 aircraft from Aero and used only 24 of them, the rest it would like to sell.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft will probably have a court appearance.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice because it had to select aircraft based on a pan-European tender and not by addressing one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which is expected to arrive at Prague’s Kbely airport within two weeks.
Longer index finger than ring finger means lower cancer risk
Men who have a index finger longer than the ring finger are at less risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Cancer Journal.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60,” said Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick’s Institute for Cancer Research.
The finger could help determine which men should be screened for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and over 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
More than half of the participants in the study had a index finger shorter than the ring finger.
They were as likely to have prostate cancer as those with 19% fingers the same length.
However, those with index fingers that were longer than the ring finger had a 33 percent lower risk, compared to 87 percent for men under 60.
The length ratio of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - seems to reflect the different levels of sex hormones to which the baby is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone promotes the growth of prostate cancer.
Professor Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told the Czech News Agency that he was familiar with the study, but that he did not seem to have "completely proven" the relationship between finger length and cancer.
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks lies mostly snow, roadmen in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov is closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and cars, and the D1 stands in the direction of Prague.
The news was told by the dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (ÚAMK).
A truck crashed at kilometre 91, two trucks collided at kilometre 93, causing injuries.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided.
Drivers should drive just behind Brno at the 190th kilometer or drive through Brno and then start at the 182nd kilometer at Kyvalka.
There are several kilometers of columns.
Also on the D11 motorway there is an accident, right at the arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters high, the thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns are created, for example, on Prosek, and Štěrboholská is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Náměstí Míru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff will meet again.
Railways and airports are also affected.
Czech Railways has already had to cancel seven express trains due to snow.
For example, there are problems with the line from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already passable, but only with increased caution.
Three secondary roads are impassable in the Vyškov region, in the Brno area snow languages are sometimes formed and in the Blanen region snow chains are necessary to overcome some roads in the above-mentioned places.
One of the most affected areas was Vyškovsko.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To stretch them, you will need to put cutters.
When they will be released is not yet known.
In the Hodonín region, caution is needed in the White Carpathians.
There is a layer of snow up to five centimeters on the roads, which are only maintained by inert sprinkles to protect nature, the Czech News Agency reported.
In the Czech Republic snow fell from two to ten centimeters, the most fell in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian Region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snow in the Czech Republic is gradually disappearing.
U.S. Military Has a New “Smart Weapon”
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a tiny super-precision cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
Special bullets of 25 mm caliber, developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive explosive explosive, actually function as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only on impact, but at any point along their ballistic path.
They can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected from the top, and when a murderous rain of steel splinters falls on it, it can knock it out of combat.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically treats it by finding the target, sending a laser beam to it to determine the distance, so he gets the specified intentional point, adjusts the angle according to it and presses the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the weapon charges and fires at a range of 543 metres plus or minus one, two or three metres," Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu will move its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs from the current administration building to Marienbader square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year.
Fujitsu will move its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance giant announced on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move their jobs from their current office building at Marienbader-Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex in Lyons Street, a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad, in July next year.
According to a spokesman for Fujist, another 100 jobs in the region are expected to be relocated there in the near future.
The lease offer was said to be very attractive and the spacious offices in Astro Park are said to be more suited to the working way of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only on rent.
Managing director Bernd Wagner said, “We have found a central location with excellent infrastructure in Frankfurt-Niederrad.”
Excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday caused joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Markus Frank (CDU), the head of economic affairs at Frankfurt, said he was winning a "global player" in the process.
He said it was a “fantastic display of confidence in the area.”
Fujitsu is said to be suited to the city, settling is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed of the company’s intentions in good time.
“Of course we offered the company our help,” Korwisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader-square.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now the point is to avoid a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on the Rathaus-square, which has been used by Fujitsu so far, and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were among the most discussed construction plans of the spa town ten years ago, along with other buildings on the Marienbader-square.
Between the railway station and the town hall, a joint project between the town and a private designer, the so-called urban entree, was criticized for its massive development of areas that previously served as parking lots and also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then still affiliated with Siemens, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group and the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and were sold a year later to Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid, Spain.
The Fujitsu-Concert in Tokyo is the world’s third-largest IT provider.
For example, it offers computers and servers available to companies and also takes care of the necessary service.
The Rhine-Main office is one of the largest in Germany, but the largest number of Fujitsu employees is in Munich.
A subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, with other subsidiaries in this location being Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the Astro Park office building, 7,000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
The complex - its name highlights the star-shaped floor plan, which is twenty years old, also houses, among others, the central union of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is in trouble.
Amazon has shut down its discovery platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened under political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange reportedly resides in the UK.
Wikileaks, the detection platform, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, is to be held up by a newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon server".
"Free speech in the land of the free," activists posted on Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before that, the internet company Amazon had downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) secret diplomatic cables to handle the high number of accesses to documents.
Using Twitter, he explained to Wikileaks about this move: "Fine - we will now spend our dollars by employing people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with free speech, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after fellow Senator Joe Lieberman officials conducted a search, CNN reported, citing the Lieberman office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Defense Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to have taken this step earlier, given the earlier disclosures of classified information on Wikileaks," he said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for preventing the platform from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, outrageously and recklessly, putting our national security at risk and putting life on the planet," a non-partisan senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to distribute the stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
Based on a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", a 39-year-old Australian man in the UK is said to know the exact location.
An internet activist has always referred to the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats.
"Even there have been calls to assassinate Julian Assange".
That is why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
Wikileaks founder will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for publishing on Wikileaks be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, a senior government adviser, Stephen Harper, said on television that, ironically, Assange should be “murdered” and Obama could use a “target plane.”
Meanwhile, a verbal firefight erupted between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange was demanding the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the recently released spy calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of one person with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now scrutinizing the security of its databanks.
Assistant Director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed Special Envoy, the White House said.
Travers became responsible for developing the "necessary reforms in the structure" that are required following the publication of the embassy's reports on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are to be put at risk for publication on Wikileaks.
"We did everything we could to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice Cream University
At Gelato University near Bologna, ice cream confectioners prepare for better seasons.
The basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelatire and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a slightly outdated ice cream maker, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooling box with a spatula, wipes it in a wafer and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
If you want to learn more about ice cream, you can avoid the Gelato-University of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream maker established an ice cream university to make ice cream from his machines fit everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
There are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and a practice in your own ice cream shop.
Some are looking for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others are daring themselves to the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of Industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years of stressful work she wants to start something of her own.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Kairu.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia has arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste is decisive, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the Southern and patriotic icing on the cake during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a good deal of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then turns on the machine tap and flows out pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the lecturer is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one experiment alone?
Luciano warns to get carried away by the spirit of the time into the unknown.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" seem to have used stabilizers as well - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilizers, but it must be sold within a day, otherwise it will collide and the customer will eat all the ice grains.
Some variations of the base mass are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to force a lot of flavored ingredients on you."
“You should be experimenting.”
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with white base ice cream that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Participants are now allowed to take an ice cream machine course.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when a balanced mixture brings out the taste of Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If a peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano takes out a device to determine the sugar content of the fruit (the winemakers measure the must from the grapes).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It does not only help the device for automatic production of base material.
There is also a device that mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream at the same time and cools it to minus the temperature.
Despite all the automation, we cannot avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo soils himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with a fruit puree when a huge blender gets out of control.
"In every course," Maestro Luciano believes, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Reviewers in a Double Light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is linked to an industry experimenting with genetic plants.
The accusation has now been made by a group of Testbiotech experts who consider themselves to be an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well,” Christoph Then, head of Testbiotech, said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa Expert Group on Gentechnically Altered Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have had a contract with the Ilsi lobbyist association for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in Efsa’s control regulations for genetic plants, and thus faces a clear conflict of interest.
Efsa's regulations are said to be consistent throughout the paragraphs with Ilsi's documents and thus carry a manuscript of the industry that should be checked by an authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has highlighted a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Efsa moved without amendments or a transitional period to the Swiss agrarian concern Syngenta - thus changing sides.
Also, Radio for Central Germany (MDR) recently revealed the personal connection of the EU-Office of Control with the industrial lobby, which aroused the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and MEPs of the EU.
Meanwhile, Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. also those from the industry, if they are of high professional quality, stated in one statement.
Professionals working for Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But he has to prove them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It describes itself as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, to estimate the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist's contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that gentechnically altered plants are currently allowed in animals without any attempt at feeding, and that they do not test the response of genetic plants to environmental influences.
“We want to know, for example, what a genetically altered corn will do in the field,” says Then.
The current practice is to only test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not give reliable results.
"If they're not looking for risks, how can they be found?" asks Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
She has been researching gentechnics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the USA, the industry is now also increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who are not connected to the concern.
Studies that are critical to companies are usually not published.
"Industry controls security research", Hilbeck believes.
Trace of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening he was standing in front of a train station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar station cut.
When the construction was halted, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"Don't disappear."
"Cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When one cut open, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he's going to do with the pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near T?bingen on the former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man is dealing in old stones.
He bought all of them during the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared to the depot,” she says in her office, a wooden booth that was previously a watchhouse.
He relates that he was scolded and threatened when, in September, all the newspapers reported that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from a company carrying out demolition.
But he talked to the opponents of the S-21 all day.
He explained that he was not responsible for the demolition.
And when that happens, it’s wiser to keep using the stones.
Then it took about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 kilograms heavy block, price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also hope to return it during re-construction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a load of 25 large trucks.
About half are still in the woods, the rest have long since sold.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and towed what could fit in the trunk and on the trailer.
The stones of the dispute from Stuttgart have long since turned into "bricks" or as the edges of flower beds with herbs.
“This stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political loophole."
He gets in his off-road car and goes for a ride around his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, then biology, then computer science, and eventually became a stone trader.
And a lover of stones.
There are 40,000 tons of stones.
He's weighing his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old-stone dealer in the republic.
He's stalling.
In the snow lies artistically worked sandstone.
"Once they belonged at the Marien-Bridge in Dresden," she says.
The Elbe Sandstone, yellow, warm, is excited.
"My favorite rock."
We continue on our way up through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the railway station in Karlsruhe.
And beyond.
"Nice travertine."
Once they belonged to the blocks on the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lie stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertine from the police presidium in Stuttgart, red granite from the Sankt Blasien temple, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were broken by hand and transported using simple hoists and bull wagons, he becomes completely reverent.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were to be crushed."
He didn't become rich, very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener have settled in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says one who appreciates the leftovers.
He's got to get to Cologne soon.
Stones will also be saved.
The battle for high-potential talent
There are a lot of people at the refreshments.
16 students are pressing on sandwiches with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Volkswagen have invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with the developers of the company VW are here to talk about the car of the future - and just casually get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies, like VW, are striving to succeed in the race for the smartest heads and are betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: Recruit the most talented graduates in the auditorium as soon as possible, before they get into the job market and others are interested in them.
Since the universities do not publish any lists of success of their students, the companies try to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and win them over.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive concern is trying to attract talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department gives out pens, rubber bears and plates with the VW logo.
He tells promising young talents about internship programs, student jobs and hints at trips to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates more closely, and figure out who would fit in as a co-worker."
Such collaborations, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
But the news is that they are so openly fighting for the students.
"Otherwise, it was more of a substantial professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from long queues of applicants.
On the contrary, they must try and attract a particularly highly qualified workforce.
Above all, engineering graduates have an excellent bargaining position.
According to the Association of German Engineers, 40,000 engineering jobs remained unfilled in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the shortage of engineers will grow even further.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt for KPMG, an auditing and consulting firm.
It organizes challenging Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure hunt in which participants must find their way according to the GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
Participants can also visit KPMG offices and get to know the company.
It will be decided in advance in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Creme de la Creme will fly to the U.S. from many interested parties.
According to Dykta, there will be tougher laws in the fight for High Potentials in universities.
"We want to differentiate ourselves with our Race."
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Looks like talent hunter Dykta's in luck.
"We stayed in touch with all the participants of a similar event last year."
"Some will be leaving school soon and are planning to apply for a job with us," he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies present themselves classically on the labor markets.
"We are trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"Like at Intersolar," said Sitha Stobe, head of personnel at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
He is familiar with the issue of young workers.
There are currently 35 positions on the company’s website.
“Right now, it’s hard to fill the gaps.”
“It takes a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, e.g. the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform that it is possible to do a practice or write a diploma thesis in our country."
Solar specialist does not organize any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
“Large companies often can’t offer it,” says the head of the personal department at Stebe.
Money has not played a major role in job search for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for advancement are other decisive factors.
Solarworld was ranked 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers in one study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks co-workers how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and monitors the framework conditions of employees.
The head of the personal department, St?be, hopes that the placement will bring her points with those interested in a job.
"I think that interested parties are particularly aware of external evaluations of potential employers," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
They want their customers to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, that means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees,” he says.
This is called internal employer branding, i.e. the promotion of the employer in the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise themselves to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing with string," says Kriegler.
Obama halts new oil drilling
In the coming years, there will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of the US-federal state of Florida.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding ban - thus definitively rescinding the earlier plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new wells are prohibited.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the ban, which should be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon drilling tower in April.
Before the disaster, which cost eleven workers their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the U.S., President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Proponents are trying to reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To date, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy concern BP, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The Commission of Inquiry, commissioned by Obama, is expected to present the results in December.
In October, Home Secretary Ken Salazar lifted a drilling ban that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent such a disaster with tighter controls and tighter safety regulations.
Currently, the Audit Office is fundamentally reforming, which has brought to its attention many corruption allegations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would eliminate lucrative tax evasion options for oil and gas companies.
Industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will substantially reduce the volume of oil produced in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest drag on the growth of the gas and oil industries," according to a recent survey by consulting firm BDO, ahead of the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance says: “Nobody knows exactly what regulation will change.”
Investments in new mining projects are shifting until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned
The water in the rivers is oily brown, smelling like a pump: billions of gallons of leaked oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People make their living by stealing, corrupting and illegally cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "You'll get plenty of oil mud in front of your lens today."
A 37-year-old Nigerian man has watched an attempt to photograph a boy wading through the water surrounding the smudges: the scene looks almost beautiful in a rainbow of water.
The fact that brown oil precipitates beneath the surface is not visible.
She used to collect enough shrimp in containers, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the slow-flowing water had become completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a huge, moist area from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to get into the waters where there are fish: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger River Delta, is one of the worst infested areas in the world.
On the way down the river through mangrove swamps with lots of side tributaries, the entire extent of the trigger is only noticeable.
The engine on the boat boils brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever dips his hand in the water pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves rise from the ground like black licorice sticks, leaving their leaves to hang sadly.
In vain are we looking for flocks of birds that are commonly found in humid areas: As soon as the engine of the boat is quiet, a ghostly silence is placed in the former paradise, where it smells like a pump.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says sadly Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear for health."
The comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where fighting has been going on for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe flocked here, here the first resistance was formed in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here Shell had to stop its production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for the employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni region: while the entire area of the delta, which is three times the size of Switzerland, is mined daily with more than 5,000 drilling holes and 7,000 kilometers of run by more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoni region are fallow, the situation is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters it rises from the water of a steel structure like a bizarre sculpture: "Christmas trees", so they are too tenderly called drill hole heads.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusty to the core.
At any moment, such a head of the drill hole breaks, Akpobari tells, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion liters of oil have flowed into the delta’s ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that has flowed into the sea off Alaska in the Exxon Valdez supertanker crash 21 years ago is one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
There is controversy over who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell says sabotage and organized oil theft account for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists say cracking borehole heads and leaking pipelines are the main cause.
In 2008, US scientist Richard Steiner accused Shell of requiring far less safety regulations in Nigeria than in the world: Only the number of failures on the lines is said to be “several times higher than elsewhere”.
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-stained open-air workshop from afar, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are completely naked and oily to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected by a conduit, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in a barrel over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, gasoline flows out of the line into the catch pot, later kerosene drips at the end of the line, and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four barrels of 300 liters a day: "We'll make about 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of a chronic fuel shortage in Africa’s largest oil state.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents per liter of diesel can still be beaten by illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who connect to the leadership everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, the entire area of the Niger River Delta is losing at least 16 million liters of oil every day.
But only a negligible portion of the provisionally stored raw material will be illegally refined: the largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, into tankers and sold on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate over whether the disaster was caused by residents and their interventions or lax production methods to be purely academic.
"If oil companies weren't considered intruders, and if they didn't completely destroy the fishermen's vitals, then there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell in particular is so strained that only the departure of the concern is considered: “Other nations may prove to be better than the Chinese.”
Michael is worried.
"It's high time you disappeared", says the muscular manufacturer.
"The soldiers could come any minute."
If a special military unit found them, they wouldn't face jail time, but a painful bribe.
Also, the soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"This cursed thing has taken our country to the bottom in every way," Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous construction flaw in A380 engines
The A380 clearly has a major safety defect.
Investigators found a possible construction error during a search of the machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas is suing an engine manufacturer.
Passengers of the Qantas airbus may have been more fortunate than previously known in an emergency landing in early November: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority has detected a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380s in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction flaw.
A possible glitch would have severe consequences: one oil connection could crack due to wear, the ATSB said in a statement released Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed the grounds for the action before the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released, and they damaged the load-bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce blamed the damage on burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough to inform everyone concerned.
After an emergency landing of the Qantas, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has retained three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 engine as a safety measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Snow will create chaos in transportation.
Germany all in white: almost all over the country, it snowed overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and planes are disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is cold in Germany: almost the entire republic fell into snow on a Thursday night in freezing temperatures - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
To the north and east lies in some places up to 15 centimeters of snow.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
At the A7 near Flensburg, road service was still in use, but could not handle the newly winded snow.
In addition, there was a strong gusty wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a stormy tide of 1.2 meters above normal on the Baltic coast in Schleswig-Holstein in the morning.
Snow drifts have caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads in Saxony.
According to Meteomedia's bad weather headquarters, the alarm level in Saxon Switzerland was therefore purple - the highest level ever.
In part, 30 centimeters of new snow fell there, strong and fresh winds causing drifts.
Several trucks and passenger cars were left there at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major problems on the roads.
On A2, wind and snow caused slow traffic and congestion.
There were problems in Thuringia due to snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, it occurs with great difficulty in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken overhead lines and switches.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld had to stop one ICE to Munich.
165 passengers were given blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescuers.
The snow blew across the road.
Many flights have been cancelled at major German airports due to snow winds.
According to a spokesman for the Flight Information Centre, cancelled flights have already been reported from Munich.
According to a Fraport spokesman, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt nach Main.
Road maintenance is in constant use.
Although few passengers remained at the airport without connection, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
There were a lot of accidents on the roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in East Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to a snowy road: a truck was also caught at the level crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overturning her car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light powder, and therefore it will rise even in light gusts of wind.
But the wind weakens.
Only at the Baltic Sea will there be fast winds with the force of a gale.
But it will be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to a newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could yield up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank had just renovated its headquarters: twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district had been modernized; in the meantime, bankers were once again allowed to take up their old jobs.
Now, the financial group apparently wants the cost of renovation back - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, reports the Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We're still exploring whether it's more meaningful to own or sell real estate and then lease it again," he said.
With this, the largest credit institute in Germany is again giving up its corporate headquarters after a short time.
The bank only took over the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from investors of its own fund and subsequently renovated them expensively.
Energy conversion swallowed about 200 million euros, according to data.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in the field estimate the value of the meanwhile renamed towers to "Greentowers" at a price of around 500 million euros, according to a newspaper text.
A spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold again to the fund's assets or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn the deaths of miners
More than 10,000 people commemorated the buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
The dead have still not been rescued, as the safety situation in the mine remains complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a powerful explosion at Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the accident occurred, but it did not find any trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend for safety.
Secondly, the strong detonation was based on the assumption that the miners had no chance of survival.
They still haven't been able to free the dead.
Now honor the memory of the dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand, 10,000 people gathered in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
To commemorate the buried miners, 29 tables were built, with helmets, lamps and the names of the miners.
Also pictures and personal belongings such as clothes and surfboards have found their place here.
Flags were flying at half-mast on state government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would rise again from the "deeps of the earth" to the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees at the memorial event.
"But they never came home."
He can’t say goodbye to his son until he sees his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration.
During the 19 November explosion, British and South African miners were also engulfed.
Rescuers started by putting out a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Once the poisonous gases are dissolved, the cooling of the high temperatures inside the mine will begin, Police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
Damn it, warriors!
Is horror good for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to conquer the old frontiers again with his fighting epic "Walhalla Rising".
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking one-eyed warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and on a grand scale kills his opponents with almost supernatural force - sounds ideal for young men looking for bloody action, as our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and even rips his enemies' guts from his belly when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One-Eyed, as he is really called, does not say a word during the entire film, and the other characters at most utter one or two sentences or allow themselves to be drawn to the agonizing dying screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and revel in the horribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It's good when the film has more target groups, it's just a shame when they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists bringing his works either more humor to the mainstream or less brutality to the artistic audience.
Most fans of art cinema seem to be discouraged by splashing their brains and guts everywhere.
Fans of action films get bored at the latest when One-Eyed sets sail for Jerusalem with a group of violent Christian missionaries for free, and hangs in the wind and fog for all eternity, before the crew seems to arrive in America and remain silent.
It is no wonder that Walhalla Rising was not released in Germany and is now only available on DVD.
It's a shame mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the distinctive facade, sometimes with blood, hides an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
This film is not about dialogue or exact plot, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream that has become a film.
And that's no escape for the spectator.
Refn does not give him a moment of relaxation and slowly suffocates him with his chilling shots and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all with the indescribable hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only the little blond boy who helps the One-Eyed retains something of innocence, all the others being driven by malice.
Most of all, a one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, who will become a time for enemies and temporary allies a warrior from hell, perhaps an emissary of the devil.
It creates destruction, but also only for the wicked.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for annoyance, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new warnings about the secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is resisting expression - and won't allow control.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious square building in Syria.
It is located on the shores of Euphrates; the nearest major city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), her name appears when it concerns a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that is branching off the stream.
Based on a U.S. foreign intelligence report from the CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technology of the 1950s is no different.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animations, she explained where the reactor components could have been before they were destroyed, which is a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, photos were submitted showing the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor is said to have been shortly before launch, but still without the fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little more is known than at that time, even the puzzles have increased over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but basically had no basis for an "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of an “alleged reactor,” though they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “reliable.”
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how confident he was that he had a reactor ahead of him, a senior UN diplomat said in the summer that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions.”
The rubble of the allegedly "unused military buildings" was quickly cleared by the Syrians and also properly leveled the terrain.
Yet in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar managed to find traces of uranium that had been man-made.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite photos of commercial vendors through a member state just after the attack, which should be more concise than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market, because they were bought exclusively by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never had a secret nuclear program, nor has it built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA disproved it after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite footage.
In addition, it prohibited inspectors from second inspection at el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed building.
Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," Ehud Olmert, the then-reigning prime minister, recently confirmed.
The investigation into the case has been dragging on to no avail since June 2008 and is "growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the office", as admitted by a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, this is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers three more facilities to be “in working order” with the alleged reactor to be the key to progress, and they still exist.
The reviewers have not yet said which devices are involved, what their function is, or why they are suspected.
According to information from the newspaper, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found satellite images of a complex of buildings that is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It appears to be located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base, which is why Syria denies the IAEA access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was said that Syrians were afraid of a so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the US beforehand to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence and satellite imagery that material has been transported back and forth between these three sites and the Euphrates square.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one furnished should be "in connection with the production of fuel".
But there is “no evidence of sensitive activities,” that is, enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where plutonium should later be splintered into a bomb, there are only probable estimates for these central questions.
It is also unknown whether the debris that could hide important clues is hidden in these three locations.
As if hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the face of the earth, no one seems to have any information as to where the rubble has reached.
Just a few kilometres from El Kibar, the IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine on the other side of Euphrates, which Syria had inspected in 1998, to be a suitable repository for radioactive waste.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked it to the reactor in one analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned journal Jane's Intelligence Review.
But images from space show that after the IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out earthworks at all suspicious sites and removed large containers.
It may have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear up suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months developing a plan for reviewers that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much interest there is in reviewers.
Damascus has since rejected the proposal.
If just a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna were reassuring themselves that the reactor was destroyed and therefore the thing was not burning, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for several months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to design the inspections, has already spoken about the “option I am leaning toward in the future,” but he is hesitant.
This choice carries a great risk: On the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA’s Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything at all?"
Love in a Time of War
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directorial debut this summer, there have been problems.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but it also causes restlessness.
There are persistent rumors that the woman, who is a Muslim, falls in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned filming from Sarajevo to Hungary moved quickly.
The film has since been made in Hungary and is in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims' Organization wrote through UNHCR's Jolie refugee relief organization and requested a meeting with the actress, according to a now-Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also an ambassador for the UN refugee relief organization.
She is not exactly diplomatic - she offered to meet women in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the rape camps, love stories weren't happening, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims reveals a lot about the script.
Her organization has recommended the UN refugee agency to release Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What kind of scenes did Jolie write?
Bosnia’s Culture Ministry, which has been given a chance to read her script, has allowed filming after a small tug-of-war in Sarajevo, but it’s unclear why Jolie didn’t show up.
The young author emphasizes that she has no political intentions in her film, that she devoted great efforts to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains indefinite.
There is another version of the film that sounds really different: the lovers knew each other before the war began, and they meet again when she is dragged as a Bosnian Muslim to a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds a lot different than "rape victim falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war - is true.
Jolie said she was under pressure "which is not fair and is based on faulty information."
Now she can be freed by hackers from Hollywood: by illegally posting her script on the Internet, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but gone
It's good for the Irish again tonight.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates the power significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar with joy at the sound of loud music, stamping their feet.
Bailey-Pub in Cork, South Ireland, is boiling because players throw tennis balls three metres away in beer cups - and they hit.
"Beer pong" is called a bizarre theater, and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning bonus, plus tickets to Las Vegas for the World Cup of Beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this screaming beer game and restrained computer scientist don't go well together.
Still, the 26-year-old man tries to have fun, to relax from the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not playing passion in Las Vegas, he is going to New Zealand for an interview in January.
"I have a strange feeling about this," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe that's a good sign", says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two out of three Tanner siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney; his brother Colin now has a job as an IT-adviser in London.
The boys leave: As with the Tanners, this seems to be the case in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, experts from ESRI’s Dublin Institute for Economic and Social Affairs predict.
It is expected to have 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar wave of emigration as Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of ascension that has brought great prosperity to the Irish, dismalness is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is mainly affecting young, educated Irish people, who have only experienced an upswing so far.
The loss of employment and social descent seemed absurd in those boom years.
Everyone needed money, everyone needed money.
Meanwhile, three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are out of work.
There are many letters in the Irish Times from readers complaining, "In Ireland, everything is going downhill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, they're going away, and our country is losing a generation."
"Please turn off the last light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future as black because the government is only lying and offers no prospects for young people.
“They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
She observes her classmates wandering from one unpaid practitioner to the next.
Her biggest worry is that she'll have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers an overall service on the topic of working abroad.
“For beginners on the job market, working abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website there are photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
Seán O'Donovan has known about what it's like to build something somewhere else for six months.
Because the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues on construction work in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, it continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts to pay off a house loan at home.
“The situation is sometimes a little crazy,” he says, as he crosses the threshold of his own house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm basically not in at all."
He laughs embarrassedly and walks through cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with well-kept gardens, large expensive cars parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions," he says.
Are you worried that the loan might not work out well?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, finishes the hot tea and says, "I have no children to feed, and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The engineer doesn't like the moaning he hears so often.
"No one needs to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells the story of his father, who went to England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back again and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep an open future and simply wait to see how life develops elsewhere.
He’s also been working in London for several years now, and why shouldn’t it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand as well?
But there’s one more thing that worries him these days: celebrating his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's worried she might turn into a bachelorette party.
“No emotions,” he says, and drinks his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it an exit party, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Common Practice of Democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the promotion of private enterprise.
Crime is of greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered by many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of a recent Latino-Barometro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can track changes in attitudes across the region.
In this year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the Pacific Rim in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% that year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy was recovering after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are convinced Democrats, which pulls back the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but a big increase compared to 2001 when it was 25% (Graph 3).
Roughly 34% said they trust the assembly in their country and 45% trust the government, again the same numbers as last year, but a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
The support was created during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only marginally in 2009 and fell again this year to 32%.)
However, the mood varies from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and the state of violent crime worsened.
For only the second time since surveys began to be conducted, more respondents across Latin America see crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue (see Chart 5).
Roughly 31% say that either they or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but this is a decrease compared to 38% last year and is also the lowest figure since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in increasing support for private business and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say that private business is essential for development, this percentage has risen from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage has risen from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela share the same view (and 80% support private business there), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the region, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua.
Criticized elections
No one expected the general election in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But they were far worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
Elections meant filling urns and repeating ballots, ballots scattered across the canals, broken polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many moved because of the January earthquake, wandered around trying to figure out where they could go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed precursors, shouted that it was a hoax and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent in nature, spread throughout the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, stated that "it was a pretty good election in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean cautiously said they "do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily cancel the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are owed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The expected decisive match is scheduled for January.
All electoral hope is not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper and Mirlande Manigat, a former First Lady, withdrew from their original call for the vote to be declared invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is identified by the Electoral Commission as having achieved a decisive duel.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were concerns that voter turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization they were prevented from doing so.
About 250,000 identity cards, which are necessary for voting, remained undivided shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
It is clear that Haitians will do this on their own.
To the top of the page
In the weeks when she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, Argentina's president, benefited from public sympathy, with her popularity rising from 20 to over 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's election may depend on the grieving Mrs. Fernández giving up the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor, and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
Everything will be based on these signs.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to pursue economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized at Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where the government was slapped and accused of corruption), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
The budget for 2010 will now also apply for next year, with the president having more space to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: growth of up to 9% is likely this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists are talking about a figure that is close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, set priorities for growth and poverty reduction, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and cleared INDEC, the statistical agency that agreed to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
It called for negotiations between private enterprises and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was boosted by the rise in world prices for Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on the Great Devaluation of 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is making it known that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck a deal with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure debt that Argentina defaulted on in 2001.
Now President Fernández faces an agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted on not having this fact in sight of the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to propose a new national consumer-price index that will commemorate the introduction to the INDEC cleanup.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term, when her husband is no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get the support of the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
By the time Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the tide of sympathy will be waning.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly relinquish many of the views her husband held in politics.
Half an encouragement to China
Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, voted for mayors and city councils in the five boroughs on 27 November, which can be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself represents the feelings that have prevailed on the mainland and have a strong stake in business relations, including a partially free trade agreement, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayor's offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is favored by Taiwan's greater independence, won nearly 50% of all votes against the 45% KMT party.
If this were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote share has declined by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party, together with the KMT, were in city councils.
The election took place like most Taiwanese elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass rallies with flags with scantily clad girls.
There was even a mandatory assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien squarely across the face, wounding him and killing the viewer.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the land itself remained behind.
Instead, candidates argued over plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
The KMT thus tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also dropped anti-Chinese sentiment.
It is a response to the fact and the realization that Chinese trade is crucial to Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, has confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They would also like to see political integration, but first things first.
It will be better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President in 2000-08 was a rebel and supporter of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation has developed that is moderate, and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been hailed as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing its best to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "credible alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems upset by this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would fare better if they insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will struggle to choose between potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's ratings were poor, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go campaigning with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will reorganize his cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly advocated proposals in support of Taiwan for establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the Best New Artist category
The president's speech and the people's speech are bound to be noticed.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is hailed as one of the surprise Grammy Awards this year with a nomination in the Best New Artist category.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008 when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in line with Grammy rules that an artist may not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly took a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and nimble hands with elements of pop, funk, and Latin influences, we can speak of Spalding as the success recorded in 2003 by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters looking for a similar jazz piece in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy judges are rightfully appreciating Vijay Iyer's Trio album "Historicity" in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride of the album that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against experienced saxophonist James Moody's album "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's album "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a hoarse New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" show, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which is otherwise favored by albums by Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin, and Jeff Lorber.
The wild Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with its knowledge of steampunk has won several well-deserved awards in the category of large ensembles, with the competition of the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the still bold Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey Lead in Classical Music
Nominees for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.
Leading the nominations are Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with a count of five points, and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with a count of three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California were Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was ordered through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A.-based songwriter Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance at an award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, operatic, choral and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producer of the year has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album were received by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Symphony Vocals; "Sacrificium - the
As for the category of opera, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and the BBC.
Composers who are nominated for Grammys for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti," and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance that was recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute episode is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for the soloist's instrumental performance with the orchestra.
The L.A. composer stated that he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote this with the help of Middle Eastern tones and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for leading the Chicago Symphony in recording works by Stravinsky.
The instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were among the nominated vocal soloists this year, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
Soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination in the Classics category for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Planned mosque in Temecula gets planning commission approval
The planned mosque in Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project for promoting terrorism and will lead to a suspension of trade.
However, jurors decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center was in line with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, anyone you can think of," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I am very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal," he added.
“Those who are against it only shout out loud.”
"We have some really good people in our valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time was spent discussing with people who were for or against the center. These votes were evenly distributed, reports Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
“There is no more America,” one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty sunk in the sand".
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 tragedy when New York City was attacked by terrorists.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmonush condemned the violence.
His religious community of approximately 135 families had been plagued in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wished for a larger and more suitable space than the storage space he had rented together with the manufacturer of the filtration systems.
The new mosque, 24,943 square feet in Mediterranean-style architecture, will also have two minarets and will grow to 43 feet in height.
It should occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometres east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents of the project can still appeal to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that may use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the scope for searching for new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, claiming that it is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that were previously considered and fundamental.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
"This is a very strange fact, but it is not proof that it is some form of truly 'alien' life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared in an online issue of the journal Science on Thursday.
For a long time, six main elements were considered necessary for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue growing after phosphorus is substituted for arsenic.
"You'll start to wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for the search for life beyond Earth, because researchers need to be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the news report published to be discussed, which did not reveal the details of the find, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That is not the case.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be as absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another element in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she considered that a microbe that is exposed to both elements may be able to replace one another.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms can find it very difficult to separate these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that, like phosphorus, it doesn't work. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better under the action of phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility increases that the life form that uses arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, stated that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced with phosphorus, is not new, but there has never been an example on which to prove this fact.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, so scientists speculated it may have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it formed in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs that were stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff said Thursday.
Four show dogs - two akitas and a Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs were found late Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles area police department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what locality, nor did he share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not reached to comment on the case.
They were overjoyed when their two akitas were found at a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Three-year-old Trace Akita and 10-month-old Didi were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke breeds Rickard and Peek, who planned to participate this week in district competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undiscovered until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to take part in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions, scheduled in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop on almost a month's travel of the couple's dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took with them three dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton Pointer - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akitas and Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in the car, where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little so that the dogs had plenty of fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car stolen at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he will offer a reward to anyone who leads them to the missing dogs. The dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether prizes would be awarded.
Lion ready to roar again now that MGM restructuring gets final approval from court
After 18 months of upheaval and uncertainty, MGM was finally given the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially blessed a creditors’ “pre-packaged” plan to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing movies and television shows.
Thursday's decree that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy rules leaves no legal hurdles for MGM to restart Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the principals of the slimmed-down studio.
The number of employees will fall to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge abruptly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources to allow a $500 million loan to fund new MGM operations and productions.
It is now a merger with an investment bank, which itself needs $75 million, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to handle their finances, as management struggled to afford to pay interest of $300 million a year.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and turnaround expert, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial difficulties and the studio's 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay the $2 billion plus funds demanded by the lenders.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board, and the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan. After months of debate and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Coopera will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper's companies, which collect $375,000 a month for their services, will receive a $4 million success fee.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the funding of two films, which will be based on the book "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, was looking to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technology Toys That Will Keep Your Gift Budget in Balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system, but in both cases it is a significant interference in the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX wheels for $99, and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 beaded skipping ropes or approximately 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law was working; this year’s technology toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While relatively fewer new toys with associated sites have appeared, the two most well-known toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices shown are from Toys "R" Us, except where noted otherwise.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, age 3) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their tummy.
On one press, the animal will give a tone, and the other will begin to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60$, from 2 years old)
Last year on Elmo Live technology I borrowed a 14 inch animatric doll that can play Simon Says and can also walk for a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel blocking.
The children test the toy Mickey Dance Instructor, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years of age), with a backpack full of quiz cards, designed to turn driving into fun with a self-correcting, funny workbook.
If you’re glancing at a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children aged 3 to 8) is the cheapest option with an easy-to-use, qwerty keyboard, although games don't have as effective a learning experience as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children aged 3 to 12), the first major change to the Leapster range from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
The iXL from Fisher-Price ($90, for children aged 3 to 7) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows family photos to be displayed.
Finally, the Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children over 8) is a set of five cubes that are no bigger than a matchbox, each with an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the dice in a row before time runs out; it’s great for competing in impromptu word creation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented in the toy shops to the greatest extent.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or an animal Puffle.
Slightly larger than your toothbrush’s bristle is the Hexbug Nano ($10, for children over 5), the latest in a range of button cell microbots.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random directions.
It is fun when you make a maze out of cubes and watch if he manages to find a way out.
He is also very resilient.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
The introduction of finer police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlling his orders and issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted female members - China's burly enforcers of urban order, feared and despised for their crackdowns and penchant for violence - to convey a certain impression to a crowd of bystanders.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering softly, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood at attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are arranged as by ruler.
Four headgear fits perfectly on the hair, which is perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," said Mr. Tang disdainfully.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One town ordered new recruits to have a college education.
Guangdong province has changed its grey-green uniforms to the supposedly more attractive blue.
In central China, Wuhan replaced gazes with strong armaments: in 2009, a report stated that 50 officers surrounded the snack cart relentlessly and stared at the owners until a door-to-door salesman packed up and drove away after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 residents in Chengdu, chose surgery as its main painting.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its municipal police, who have been selected specifically for their appearance, symmetry, and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, also a more subtle, feminine side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese urban groups.
Critics would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce the city ordinance, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province beat an uninvolved viewer to death after he used his cell phone to film how they were doing in the crackdown on the landfill protest.
Last year, police training took place in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual included, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat the offender without signs of blood.
This year, a peddler in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left brain injury.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded on the Internet, depicts Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, the national edition, lamented last year after another debate over tactics.
The paper said "really thorough cleaning."
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised interest in eight new female police officers in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district demanded female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good physique and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than the average - that is, higher than 1.6 meters.
Retiring at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials say the job is too mentally demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed police officer on Rednet.com, a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities that then determine others, these include height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the nature and the "inner qualities".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "Besides being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city management, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that college requirements are also common in China for other jobs, both genders.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
This means that the issue of good looks is a subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Disability or mutilation certainly does not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or hunchbacked man to serve here," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps watch in Baoguang Square near the monastery, has 22 years old, apple-like faces and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn’t think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just driving businessmen into the aisles where they can pursue their business.
Each morning, the group faces more than ten marketmen running around on foot or on bikes, trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before being driven out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Miss Xu, as the market man began to run, and for a time he left his wheel with the noodle cart.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
“It’s basically the same thing every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in her free time marketing.
"Big routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the authority of their male counterparts to seize the goods from sellers.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after false rumors spread that police killed a salesman.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured during the night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where police patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Police confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store as required by regulations.
The owner of the car could cry as he wanted.
A 15-minute standstill in front of the police, looking angry, elbowing against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator affiliated with the men's group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, co-ordinators are men over 40 who only have an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintaining and smoothing the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
“Most of the time, it’s the public that’s going to get started.”
Prosecutors Won't Blame Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator's lawyers said on Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and which, until the time of the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair made national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said he was "certainly pleased" with the decision, which followed almost a year of investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action before the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department "informed us that Senator Ensign would no longer be the target of the investigation and that there was no plan to press charges against him on this matter."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents published in the October 2009 New York Times reported that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby that was to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political backers to find work for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after they employed Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, so many present papers and interviews.
Since Hampton was Mr. Ensign's assistant until recently, he was barred from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year by law.
Ethics experts say that the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared in violation of the ban on lobbying.
The evidence released "shows that this is a clear case of preparation for breaking the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients under investigation by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasons for the decision on Senator Ensign's case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the Department was cautious about political lawsuits after a large number of setbacks, including a decision last year to suspend the lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens amid allegations of misconduct by the Attorney General's Office.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid the guns," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign over the matter.
"It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the law," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's chief attorney, said in an interview that he received a call from the Attorney General of the Department of Justice on Monday and the following day, telling him that the Department had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's advocacy team is working with prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in Wednesday's statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had given to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable recounting the details of my discussions with the Justice Department except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission ruled to halt an investigation into a separate complaint in which an ethics group files charges that Ensign's parents' payment to the Hamptons of $96,000 violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing more than a gift.
One company that Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work for was NV Energy, a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
One December 2008 e-mail showed that after Mr. Hampton began working as a lobbyist at the company, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton, telling him that he had "pumped" the Home Office on the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his post as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After many months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to take part in a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation by his spokesman Jennifer Cooper, the senator said he hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Department of Justice and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the Nevada people," she said.
Cheshire village appeals to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were in the courtroom.
Minutes after minute, they were sending out reports of gruesome testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 tweets dealt with raping and tying children to beds in the house that was set on fire.
Thursday saw the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, and was to hold an official termination with the imposition of the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed an appeal with the court with claims and arguments that would likely keep the court busy for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting of the trial - including the widespread use of Twitter by mainstream reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with outrageous details then led the jury to make a decision in a sense of influencing the public's opinion.
This claim could force judges to consider whether or not to require new rules in the courtroom with the advent of new technologies.
"As I experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes's chief defense attorney.
The trial judge Jon C. Blue of the state Supreme Court briefly rejected the claims regarding last week's ruling, stating that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury was acting under the influence of the public.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court overturned the sentencing of Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its ruling that the Sheppard v. Maxwell case was a "carnival atmosphere" in the media trial.
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have said that the appellate courts that reviewed Hayes' sentence half a century later might be surprised by the argument that new rules that determine the way of communication from the courtrooms might be necessary, which was unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There's a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School law school professor who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be preoccupied with the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms can make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hayes' lawyers who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
Defendants also argue that Mr Hayes' case may be biased, for example, when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal, fear-mongering photographs when selecting a jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by photographs of the victims, which became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defenders say they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge wrongly dismissed a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think over the weekend.
The judges were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scale of the process may attract the most interest.
They stated in an objection to the verdict made last month that the case dominated news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly fanning the flames of emotion in the case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters to court," the lawyer wrote, "was something never before seen here in New Haven, and is perhaps also a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists claimed that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports given later, and from their point of view, the judicial police should direct the scope of the other trials.
But some lawyers have called for appellate courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require the courts to adjust.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling in Dr. Sheppard's judgment, due to the breadth of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard versus Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the gulf?
After a campaign that was notable for its offensiveness and negativity, a small amount of civility appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusive moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and parliamentary leaders did not bring about any major breakthroughs on the crucial issues that need to be discussed during the session.
In any case, it was a polite discussion of the differences between the two sides, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party struggle.
Wednesday's public meeting of the president's deficit commission was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close cooperation over several months has built mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still divides members.
And it is quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a trial period - probing each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to assess the boundaries of public opinion and voter patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday's meeting and its later evaluation by the participants were also conducted with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophic differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the conditions that have prevailed here for the last two years.
Whether it’s about taxes, spending, health care, or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory issues have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“It’s inevitable after the election.
The election aroused the party's emotions, and then they fell silent.
It's good."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed in the session, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cut expired at the end of the year, and no one considers it favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, either permanently or temporarily.
Similar to the likely compromise on unemployment benefits just because Republicans can’t watch them support tax cuts for the wealthy while denying unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After the White House meeting on Tuesday, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new Inaugural Treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to a two-party relationship when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable, he said.
"After the things that have to be done are done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in a short perspective," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is widespread to a large extent - that politeness will lead them to genuine cooperation.
"I look at all the events between now and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing that they must act on their promises and must cut government spending and repeal the new health care bill.
These supporter lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and increasing some taxes, raising the retirement age, and cutting spending.
Joint chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their view, put the pressure of the deficit issue on the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officials in the jury, who suggest that in the case of financial issues, at least today, we have little foundation or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between the White House and the House Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, with Republicans calling for Obama to address budget, taxes, and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite the partisanship at the last election, the majority of Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could be headed for a stalemate, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be watching the public reaction very carefully.
Anyone threatened with a vote cut is likely to change course and seek compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of things.
“Party and regulative power are greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it appears to have created a greater ideological divide between Obama and parliamentary Republicans than it was between Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to the more important 2012 elections.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that has emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
The city's management is in the hands of a "kleptocracy" and it continues with some of the bribes and protection bribes that come on the way to the Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia reported in February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal stores but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy -- which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called a "vertical office" -- will take its toll as money begins to move up the ladder.
The footage, which was sent to Washington under Ambassador John Beyrle's name, was posted via WikiLeaks on their website on Wednesday.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of being a major contributor to corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only observe minimal changes in the purge.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturin, who owns a prominent design firm, have for many years consistently denied allegations of corruption, and won several lawsuits for perjury for such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when asked about the evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's filthy, it's crap."
Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their society is corrupt, it will show up on the ballot.
However, it is unusual to encounter such details in such a way, namely in an embassy message, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
“The government of the city of Moscow and its connections to criminal elements have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional,’ and confirm that the government operates more like a kleptocracy than a government,” the report says.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'crysha' (a term from the world of crime and the mafia that literally means 'roof' or protection) provided to them by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Prosecutor's Office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts have identified and three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow".
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security Service, Department of Homeland Security and Militia are on second level".
"Finally, at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It's an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill in the blanks in some areas as the city doesn't provide some services."
The report says the FSB takes money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller ones.
One source said, "business owners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Internal Affairs (rather than organized criminal groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and strength than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in play."
The record says that while the withdrawal of money is complex, the protection itself may already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay fast enough, their trades are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has admitted that he has made little progress.
The embassy report talks about men taking suitcases, probably stuffed with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
“In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow’s Indem research team, in a recent interview.
“It’s part of the bureaucracy.”
"It is not part of the political class, because in Russia political classes no longer exist."
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion annually nationwide.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelations of the US embassy report, which did not appear in Moscow until late in the evening, certainly did not arouse enthusiasm among the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow’s shortcomings, this may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue on the issue.
In an interview with CNN's Larry King, Putin said the documents leaked by WikiLeaks may have been fakes and responded angrily to statements that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev's Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that it is about our mutual cooperation, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such coercion, you know, so unethically."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to deal with past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with soiled and peeled walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves that Moke."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the “butcher” for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge’s rule, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge relinquished power, long-standing loyalty in Anlong Veng is also being disrupted.
In April, victims of the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks explaining the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, the UN and the Cambodian court jointly handed down the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the sentence of a former leader, the notorious violent Tuol Sleng association, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, unrest grew among Khmer Rouge veterans at Anlong Veng, complicating efforts at reconciliation and their attempts to re-engage in Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge's rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease, or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary directed guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to transition to a government that culminated in the 1996 surrender of Ieng Sara and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who persisted, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fell into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically recall the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge retained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people have benefited little from surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by a utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were brought up with no idea of making a trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"The Mok has fed everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to provide for ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Che, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the leaders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has centered on Im Chaem, 64, who was the district leader in Banteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared over the parched grasses, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would have refused to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability will occur if the court searches for other suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms means sticking broken pieces together," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken pieces together so we can understand each other."
The center published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, has 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the Ministry of Education's history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's association with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks, and courtrooms are beginning to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong spell here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, the path is overgrown with weeds and littered with discarded plastic bags that lead to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cellphone saleswoman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the site.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and planned to later visit the resting place of Pol Pot, where she will bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to appear its uranium-based weapons stockpile
In a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would give up its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the security summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seemed to have stumbled upon the stumbling block last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the past two months, a number of covert operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from the Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material - around ?500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, as this is a sensitive matter.
The deal proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 nuclear security summit."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety support group.
Clinton called the deal a "very significant, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our commodity...We're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus acceded to the United States a few months ago and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated as the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it to supply a Belarusian research institute with less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
“Everything has been coordinated very carefully and managed on a trust basis,” said Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for weapons production.
According to the joint statement, Belarus will strive to eliminate its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual thaw.
"We welcome the progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is essential to the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not make the CIA's flights expensive
The Spanish government did not raise any concerns about CIA flights carrying imprisoned Taliban and Al Qaeda members to Guantánamo via Spanish territory, as the United States envoy to Madrid expressed in his telegram.
This is according to documents provided by Wikileaks to El País, where it is also said that then-First Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed and “may show that it has proper oversight of foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace.”
In June 2006, a meeting took place between U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega, accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's announcement "exempted Zapatero's government from the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in the matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain does not have a problem with the flights of intelligence services through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "reached unprepared", Aguirre reports in one of the documents.
Also, then-Secretary of State Miguel Ángel Moratinos indicated to the U.S. ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give the matter as low an outline as possible, but by keeping the matter in the hands of judges, the cabinet had limited options of influence".
In February 2007, U.S. Attorney Vicente González told the U.S. Embassy that he did not intend to block the judge’s initiative to demand declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Department of Defense regarding CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating file or any sensitive information," the embassy said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. has expressed concern over "overt coordination between a Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than declassifying information from the CNI or the Department of Defense.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the luncheon of U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told the ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they see fit", he had already given instructions to his associates to "avoid heated comments with the intention of reducing tensions".
The ambassador also expresses his concerns about the conduct of the Partido Popular political party in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that Partido Popular will not hesitate to take advantage of any indications that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the US government," he notes.
Confessed mother-killer complained on the network about her mother's "worries"
A young woman was talking about a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog: "Terror by Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
With this nickname, which she had used since she was a child, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the municipality of Noia in the La Coruna region, from which the young woman comes.
The news is from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life, which the ABC daily reconstructs with the help of the testimonies of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Túnez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
She soon made a new acquaintance.
Her choice was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the baby stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week.
However, the content of her communication shows that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes, "Alberto is some angry that I left for work."
"When I told him this, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he has to be with the little one all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address where I can send your baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me to leave the baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he claims.
In May, he talks about his return to his home: "I will go there this week, but I will only stay until the 19th, because the 20th I have to go for a job, so I don't lose that job".
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son with him.
“He’ll be with who he’s meant to be with, me, and I’ll never leave him with anyone but my mother,” she said.
In July, there is another contribution.
As he taps this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and probably the 10th, was murdered, is already dead.
"Caesar is satisfied on one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to be there for summer school, so I'm going to save a little money on a babysitter."
Seventeenth greetings and grievances.
"A big kiss from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, look how he wants to meet me, sex is needed".
On the 30th another message: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan".
There is also a report about Victor, the current partner: "He gives me money".
On the Internet, Monica's posts are on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she kept calling herself "The Muki Ex-Prisoner".
"Terror in Galician (motto)".
The last man she lived with, a guardian, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe it all happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the Palma Provincial Penitentiary yesterday, where she arrived from the detention center in Menorca.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, stated that the defendant did not remember how everything happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one in any way".
She admitted earlier that she drowned Caesar in a bathtub and put his body in a suitcase.
Prosecutors and defense attorneys have called for a psychiatric evaluation.
The People’s Party would win four seats in the House, and the PSC would lose nine seats.
With the results of 28 November, the PP could have the main say in the Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona town halls.
After a significant increase in votes and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has a definite idea of a general election, whether it is going to be increased or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in national elections is usually once that compared to Catalan elections.
In 2008, Catalans won 6,10,473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections the figure was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) won 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, is maintained, the party’s analysts calculated that if the general elections were held, the PPC could win 12 MPs in the Chamber of Deputies compared to the current 8, the CiU (Convergence and Unió) party would also lose at least 4 seats and the Psela would lose at least 10.
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the PP and the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the Greens, the ERC would lose one MP - now it has three - while the ICV would continue to have one mandate or win another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next rendezvous will be in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where the people could also have a decisive influence on the end of socialist domination in four major provincial cities, as well as on changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree on the possibility that the PSC could lose the City Halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not receive a majority and neither could they turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the debacle of the Republicans, it would not be impossible for the party to lose its representation in the Barcelona assembly - as it is necessary to get at least 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased the number of votes it has won in four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists believe they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP received only 500 more votes than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
They also gained at other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
PP currently has a representation in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell gives al-Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand.
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian who were detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which arranged passports for various groups of the Al-Qaeda organization, including the "Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam" and "Lashkar-e-Taiba", the latter of whom was the author of the 2008 Mumbai bombings.
The Home Office attaches great importance to the investigation of the matter, aiming to ensure through "Operation Kampai" the weakening of the al-Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and "limit its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that the cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during its two-year tenure in Catalonia, where they were then counterfeited and then shipped to groups that make up the Al-Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their “fighters” could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
Since this broken cell was not the only active jihadi network in Europe, other European police units participated in these investigations in addition to Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that in the coming days there will be no similar interventions in other European countries like the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained) another developed in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehjsan Butt were captured
It was these men who drove a cell from Bangkok, based in Spain, and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, was stealing passports that met the demands of Islamists.
This meant that the documents had to belong to men between the ages of 25 and 45, had to be valid for several years and be without a marked visa.
The investigation documents stress that no facts are yet known linking the Catalan detainees to the Mumbai attack, although the author of the attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was supposed to be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before the assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by the transfer agency, which were "put in" to buy cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "commando", which killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) is demanding that Masa stop the fiscal deal
PPC leader Alicia Sánchez-Camachova had the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Arturo Masa her conditions under which she is willing to support his inauguration as President of the Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and forego risky ventures such as the economic deal that the nationalist leader wants to propose during his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party came to a meeting with Arturo Maso with the certainty of 18 seats received in last Sunday's election, a number more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations forming the opposition to abstain from voting on his inauguration.
Future alliances that nationalists would like to keep in the House when general elections are held depend on a possible accord with the PP, but so far, the talks that Mas is holding with the rest of the political leaders are carried out in a Catalan spirit.
As for PP’s president, in order to gain her support for taking office, she “will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberation speeches” as well as to the economic deal - similar to the one in the Basque Country - that CiU’s leader even wanted to put to a referendum on.
Both leaders would like to slim down the overblown political apparatus of autonomous government and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations regarding Maso’s entry into office will be discussed by PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Alberto Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
Director of geriatrics assures that the deaths did not occur as a result of "lack of action"
Introducing the Olot Center doesn’t rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) geriatric center gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage done to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Villa Dilma, a caregiver who - while employed here - killed at least eleven seniors in his care.
Joan Sala, the director of the home for the elderly, arrived accompanied by Joan Canada, a lawyer at the facility, and announced that "the wish of La Caritat's home would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "lawfulness and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the appropriate authorities".
In addition to the reputational damage that this institution may suffer because it failed to detect the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, the demands for material compensation already being calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the survivors are now a major threat to La Caritat's home.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime occurred in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of clients of the home for the elderly, with the suspicion that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased, but that - due to the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled over the phone.
La Caritat, through her director, resolutely rejected this extreme yesterday, stressing that "the lack of action could in no way have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there are no indications in the case that any third party, other than the accused's own, has committed misconduct".
The man, now known as "The Angel of Death," confessed to killing 11 yesterday, saying he committed his first crime on August 29, 2009, and killed the second old woman a month and a half later.
In this case, he caused death by taking too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first time he used a mixture of soothing pills.
La Caritat’s director said it was complicated to control staff access to medication.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were probably six of the nine devices this caregiver used to kill patients in his efforts to relieve their suffering.
However, the analysis, which is now underway in the lab, should show whether Vila is lying and was actually looking for a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them with lye, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat do not believe the health claims and do not rule out that the number of killed may be higher than he has confessed to, and justify his behavior in the various versions that Vila filed to the court, knowing that he must change his behavior when it became clear that he had killed eight people.
That’s why they say they want to be available to the judiciary to shed light on the full scope of the matter.
The European Central Bank is threatening
Yesterday, investors reacted sharply to the threat posed by the President of the European Central Bank, Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our responsiveness".
Margin differentials closed by force, and European banks’ stocks fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that, although in decline, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It will take some time for the investor to lose his or her concerns.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to withdraw the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded an end to the plan to buy out the national debt for ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity rates within the deadline, leaving unlimited access only for a week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be forecast "at least until March" and to comply with a three-month bidding exercise with unrestricted access by the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying program and even announce an intensification of it.
Failure to meet the expectations created will re-create the reaction of yesterday’s markets, and if they continue to blindly withdraw liquidity, God be with us!
The same was true at the May convention, where they claimed they hadn’t even considered buying bonds, and the markets collapsed - history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
It was announced in May by an armored fist on Monday, and on Wednesday it said it had already bought many of them, triggering another market crash.
Yesterday's one-year promissory notes auction in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% from the previous auction.
Thus, rates in Portugal fell 30 points lower, reflecting the change in market sentiment that occurred after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures were published to represent the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent about 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after failing to detect the problem with stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the relief plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need parliamentary approval for the new budget, and it still lacks support, so there is still uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of her speech to ease tensions in the face for the next EU summit on 14 December, at which a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the prime minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action, which will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment - it sounds to investors like Four Seasons since Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market grew by 4.5%, twice as much as other European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was quick and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today, we have a key three-year bond bid that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which we hope will be in great demand to help dispel doubts about our refinancing capability.
Asking for a bailout would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They'd give us the cash we don't need -- there's 40,000 million in cash available at El Tesoro, three times as much as in March -- further high rates and market access would close us off sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy of Cesar's wife must continue to be used - "not only to be, but to appear".
We can do this.
The President of the Eulen Group will challenge Vega Sicilia’s actions requested by his children
The storm in open conflict in the family of Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, does not cease.
David Álvarez, the group’s founder, after treating him as “quite insignificant”, challenges El Enebro’s legal action, planned for the 16th of this month and requested by five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to force their majority and seize Bodegas Vega Sicilia’s procuratorship with the help of the authorities.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest business services holding company does not seem willing to settle his dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro Group.
of its administrative committee was deposed five of its seven descendants, who were named leaders during the meeting of shareholders on January 18 of this year and whose objection is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The El Enebro group's court hearing scheduled for the 16th of this month, which was convened by an official of the Trade Court No. 2 in Madrid, renewed the thunder in the Álvarez family's womb.
The appeal to the judge is the only legal means of guaranteeing the convening of a commission until the dispute is resolved.
The final move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is seen by David Álvarez as "a desperate vehicle of his five children serving by means of judicial ruse and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the January 18 action, which was completely invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying a legal challenge to this act as "completely insignificant".
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to convene a court hearing in June.
In El Enebro, a group owned by, among other activities, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, seven descendants of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires a usufruct to 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge during the trial of the issue of judicial challenge to the hearing.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes improvements in vehicles in real time.
Ever since Red Bull entered Formula One in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
Initially, no one took seriously the possibilities of this new team, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the driving skills of the champion, Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine that powers his car, a legend has been born in the world of Formula 1 - the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens has placed in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating the marches that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes very far from automotive sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software instrument, has been used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in power plants and for instruments with high precision.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce a product or simulate a process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, Sukhoi aircraft, and Nissan's most renowned commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this software enabled the Red Bull team to make “in a matter of hours, in near real time” modifications and refinements that are otherwise detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians, who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements in one period.
Today, the Red Bull team works with 180 young highly qualified professionals, equipped with powerful information technology, to analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull racing cars, except for the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
The changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser manufacturing systems and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical achievement is the $40 million, which is the maximum each Formula 1 team can spend on improving their competitiveness for each period.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech facility some 50 km from London to design and build its racing cars.
These are two buildings where visitors are restricted - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "big secret".
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull’s hero in Formula One is Sebastian Vettel.
However, behind the immense technological means that the energy drinks brand has put into its participation in the racing circuits, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable, yet no one knows them.
Steve Nevey, head of production technology, said that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed 50% to the victory, and the rest was due to the riders.
At present, this ratio has changed and technology is worth 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 stores in two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes, today inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona.
It will be the first of a network of 20 80-100 m2 stores that the multinational company plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrer, vice president of HP Spain, cited as an example a newly converted store in Barcelona’s Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to set up 200 points of sale in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores opened in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, making it the third store in Barcelona.
Herrer did not want to reveal where other stores would be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following locations.
Herrer, who also leads HP’s HR systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores will remain the same, using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company advises on the exclusive design of store equipment (with products that can be interactively tested), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also engaged in the provision of personnel for stores.
Helena Herrer denied that it was a franchise, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service, SME service when buying, servicing, after-sales service and even packaging".
The store in Barcelona is part of a world-class pilot program to address potential computer device issues under warranty.
The online service is connected to a technical centre based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“We will be able to solve problems within 10 minutes that may otherwise take up to two days.”
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for regular customers, given that large companies already have a contract service for technical assistance," Helena Herrerová said yesterday.
Sabadell is betting on "stealing" a million clients from his competitors in three years
More optimistic than other bosses, Banco Sabadell’s board delegate, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts an end to passive war.
Nevertheless, it is counting on lowering interest rates, which they will try to compensate by reducing bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to gain a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 for three years.
The aim is, in addition to surviving without having to resort to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - or 700,000 if those who eventually leave the bank are deducted - since up to now even the institute has been pampering small and medium-sized businesses rather than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% when it comes to private clients, while it is more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or sobriety, in order to reduce costs, whose challenges the bank will show when presenting the results for the period.
At this time, few banking institutions dare to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has changed all plans for world banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima program four years ago this year, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required expansion for another period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "hard and very important".
Indeed, he believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain “will be lengthy.”
In addition, it will be “very difficult to create employment” in two or three years, which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while they believe that passive war - which lowers margins - is receding, the price of the risk premiums that banks and savings banks pay for their issuances to receive liquidity is already shifting to loan prices, compensating for the margin reduction.
"The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will constitute a pressure factor on credit".
"We haven't closed the faucet yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola said.
Banesto had already issued orders to his network on Thursday to cut long-term loans and raise differential prices - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the tendency in banking "is now to cut commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
It is not without reason that he assures that in Spain "larger sizes will be required".
“Next year will not be left on a stone,” he said.
It confirms that capital needs are "much reduced" and does not preclude some Spanish institution from entering the red numbers.
And it points out that the FROB can substitute the collection of funds on the market before the new capital measure.
With assurances that Sabadell may survive temporary market closures, what some bankers are predicting as a new liquidity crisis continues to pose a serious problem.
He notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike what was in June, short-term financing using repo rates can be received, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA eliminates another wave of mergers of savings banks
The CEO of CECA rejected yesterday that there should be another wave of savings banks mergers, and again insisted on the speed with which the reorganization of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of pooling Spanish savings banks started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and would wait for the second round.
However, the CEO of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday ruled out the possibility of a new wave of these operations.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, what is happening are the conventions".
"Most of it is completely implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the big processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well on this matter," he said.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Association of Heads and Executives of Aragon), Olavarrieta described that the process of concentration is being carried out “at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown by the installments that have, at one time, not now, appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank,” he stressed.
"Going from 45 savings banks with average assets of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no historical comparison, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not very happy views on the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we have to be on deadline before the end of the year".
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The director noted that given the current favorable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks, as well as a system that has mastered the "very important" process of concentration and that continues at "the highest possible speed".
He also pointed out that Spanish banking has come out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets provoked a two-pronged government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private mediation agencies, or the abolition of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the airport manager of Barajas and El Prat, and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel over her responsibility for unleashing the current crisis.
How to interpret this movement?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complicated process of redefinition of the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is supposed to be, countering the idea of upholding the old traditions held by a large part of the other members.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also, for example, Austria and the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the mark - although now it may seem like science fiction, this version has wide public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is to redesign the euro with more macroeconomic oversight, budgetary austerity, fines for offending states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and an extension of the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for quite some time, so there is no room for the dials now.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission incited deficits in 2009, the German government pulled constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany thought was right (plans for fiscal austerity and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The Central European country showed the second when Merkel painfully delayed decisions to save Greece.
It was already the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel has once again emerged with a clear stance, demanding to reform the European Union’s conventions so as to allow for the rescue of a member state and, at the same time, for private creditors to be obliged to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat softened form, has been approved, and we should follow the Union reform process over the coming months, which should make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells all of us that, although measures now need to be taken, with which it seems to disagree too much, from that date on, the old functioning of the euro will end.
The year 2013 will mark the birth of a new currency zone in which breaker states will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to announce a deferral of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany is telling us that we must take a strict path of growth, with increased savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital buffers.
They simply do not want to tolerate another debt- and building-based option, with huge balance-of-payments gaps like the one that reigned in the boom years of Spain’s growth.
The offer is clear.
And we'd be making a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much harder.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions, we might be wrong ourselves.
I hope that this current turbulence will bring more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunity they give us until spring 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this too, and his two-pronged statement (the reforms promised after meeting with big business last Saturday and announcing new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the way has opened up to the idea that things need to be put in order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it does not seem to want to move it.
And of the options that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of not very serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has warned us.
Sports and Rule-Bypassing
Fints like Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show wit not intent to escape punishment.
The alleged expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November has caused a sea of ink to be written about whether or not this is unsportsmanlike behaviour and whether UEFA should eventually punish the two footballers.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (who had their team clearly won) the named players, one by one, deliberately lost time at the time when the foul was supposed to be played to provoke the referee, and he showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the following match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing in their group lead - and will be able, stripped of their cards, to proceed to the next stage.
In the end, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee awarded coach José Mourinho a two-game penalty, and guilty players were fined.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, rules that are unwritten, but are watched.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that Real Madrid (which boasts generosity and honor in its anthem, and which has already fined its players for similar acts) and, apparently, also due to the dramatization led by Mourinho, which adds another episode to its long history of comedian and provocateur.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is a circumvention of the law in these acts; indeed, these are actions respecting the rules of sport, the meaning of which, of course, seems to be trying to get around.
It is discussed what kind of damage such actions cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the essentials of sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opponents, which was not violated in these cases, so there was no violent game.
Another of these essentials characterizing pure play is to avoid players having an advantage over the opposing team due to their offense - which also did not happen here.
Thus, the paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally describe as a ruse or circumvention of the law did not occur, that there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but that this behavior should be as visible as possible in order to receive a penalty.
They waited and gladly received the punishment.
Another question, however, is how the culprits will benefit from their deliberate misdemeanor.
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that he will not achieve any benefit in the current match, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players start the next stage of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first glance the team can be eliminated, and besides this, the players will be penalized by this action, and move to the second round of cards, in which one card less than in the first round is enough to be eliminated.
So how the rounds will go on, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the spirit of sport, which includes making strategic decisions that will enable maximum benefit within the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, the players did not aim to avoid punishment (which would be a clear case of circumventing the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without evading or fleeing punishment.
Although the line between wit and circumvention of the rules is not quite clear, I believe that in this case it was definitely wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions to provoke them were carried out from the leadership.
Harming sports principles with these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
The battle of offers to organize Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar dictates an avalanche of reservations on December 16 and 17 this year.
There is a rapidly increasing number of celebrations paid by employees themselves who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, with the advent of December, the pre-Christmas parties come again, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis have resulted in a fight to win clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros for food, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations from this sector agree.
To complete the complicating numbers, the calendar concentrated this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) on the week of December 13, creating an avalanche of bookings for peak days (16th and 17th), while there was almost no traffic the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, there are many companies that have canceled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon traditions, many employees pay for parties out of their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices at the limit, according to Gaieta Farras, president of the association of restaurants Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona.
A representative of the patronage of restaurants does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will think twice before making a reservation."
“They want to go out, but they are cautious when it comes to the topic of prices,” he adds.
Stores will go well for those “who offer quality and good service at a reasonable price”, he says, reminding that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down a notch and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey at various facilities shows that the biggest onslaught of booking requests is for the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group is reporting a real boom of bookings for this Friday, with most requests being for spends of up to 30 euros, adapted to the menus on offer, whose total prices range from 25 to 30 euros.
In another important company, Andilana, which has 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of this year’s calendar has brought more early bookings since the beginning of November.
“We have made both possible and impossible in order to maintain last year’s prices, and our currency, which everyone should choose from, ranges from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they say.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 businesses, they remain optimistic after seeing growth in profits since the second half of the year and having fairly solid prospects for Christmas sales.
The company’s sources point out that December 18 will also be a busy day as pre-Christmas celebrations between friends take place.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they noticed a tendency for guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine).
They have also noted that companies are already emerging that are again inviting their employees, and the size of the groups seems to be slightly larger.
Fecasarm’s vice president (which includes institutions such as Barcelona’s Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres) Enric Goma believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, claiming that the number of bookings has “recovered”, although clients are “contracting to the maximum”.
This impression did not subside even during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who paid, he points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has caused widespread unrest in the United States.
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country.”
Wikileaks documents confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department published by Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary unease that the Pakistan nuclear program is fueling in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details they offer regarding the content of communications and the ideas of North American diplomacy representatives in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear security, instead of increasing, is "on the decline", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but stored piecemeal to make it more difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in one report prior to the visit of then-National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-controlled territory, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the missile program is no longer only observed by the US, but also by Russia, as a spreading and giving reason to be on the lookout.
“Pakistan has had to hire personnel with a strict religious faith to protect its nuclear facilities; due to the decline in education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev told a meeting with his US counterparts.
The biggest news of the documentation published by Julian Assange’s server is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the topic of nuclear proliferation and the increased pace of Pakistan’s production of these weapons.
A cable issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", claims: "Transparency often does not exist; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are rejected".
Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence official for South Asia, said: “Despite economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "make very clear" that "Pakistan's military must put an end to tacit support for terrorist groups" during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani's army chief.
Wikileaks boss hunt
Obama appoints a senior counter-terrorism official to avoid new leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red alert" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it is hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced an “extraordinary call,” a red notice, to “localize and track Assange’s movements.”
However, this is not a typical detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Mark Stephens, a lawyer for Wikileaks, said: “The police know where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange.”
It was November 20 when the International Police Corps, based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but it did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have been instructed to identify or locate Assange "with the aim of placing him under temporary detention and extraditing him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of the person subject to the red alert, many member states, as the organization has explained, consider the red alert to be an enabler of the arrest - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially if the states have a bilateral agreement on the extradition of detainees, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be located.
The move scandalized Assenge’s lawyers, who published a letter yesterday declaring that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks has shown a willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge sought and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal pursuit," the letter states.
While the whole world searches for him - and from Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange remains in an unknown place, but he does not remain silent.
On Monday, he interviewed Time magazine’s editor-in-chief via Skype, demanding the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations in violation of international conventions that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counter-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further document leaks.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views being voiced by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the House of Commons National Security Committee from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks as a terrorist organization "so that anyone who would contribute or otherwise assist them can be intervened and prosecuted."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said Assange should be "killed," which he subsequently had to retract.
"Obama should put a bounty on him or use an unmanned aircraft or something like that".
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former Arkansas governor, and a possible candidate for president.
"Whoever's in government, whoever's responsible for the leak has committed treason, and any punishment other than execution would be too lenient," he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC by "squinting" at Caroda adherents
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and an end to the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercos seems to have found a recipe to fight the already multiple internal revolts in the ERC ranks, to no avail due to the loss of 11 MPs and half the votes.
The party leader is aware that his resignation gesture seems inadequate to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, and he also knows that the sector’s influence is now as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot make him worry as much as he did with other defunct currents.
That is why the leader of the Left will try to win new criticisms through winks that will help him to defend himself in municipal elections.
First, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to make a secret statement about his stay in office.
Using ballots, not raising your hand.
If Carod supporters want to give the president a criminal vote, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the division and submission of his person.
in several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one extra, but added, without specifying the percentage, that there would also not be a good result "in Bulgarian".
Supporters of Carod demand that the president do more than make his position available - a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercos controls the largest body at conventions.
But since they don’t have a majority enough to force the resignations, they will try to make the executive resemble the plan from now until May.
As a result, they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategic reorientation document, which will be put to the vote of the National Council on the 18th of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercós in exchange for him promising to move Congress as early as fall 2011.
The leader of the ERC said that "multiplicity" harms stability, and that his goal is for the organization to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog seems to be significant.
After taking into account Puigcercos's ideologue, this innovation advisor took for granted that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he named five of them, of whom two stand out.
The first is to "re-compile" the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which means also include new faces who are from a sector leaning towards Carod.
The second goal can be great news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should put an end to meeting-making as a mechanism for functioning.
And so he fights for reform of the statutes, so that congresses can be held through delegates chosen by vote.
Ending the model of the meeting system, an exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which has been fighting in this direction since the last two conventions.
However, the convulsive assembly of 2008 decided that the meeting must be considered at a special congress on the reforms of the statutes.
This matter is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has discouraged resolution of the matter.
Now, without the looming critical sectors, it might be a good time to revisit the matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed in November; 390 in 2010
According to the daily MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the MILENIO newspaper.
Among the killings are cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there are a total of 390 homicides in Mexico, probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases stands out the finding of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, as well as a grace-to-the-head blow, and had her arms and legs handcuffed with a rope.
The next day, a body was found in a trunk that was stored in the vehicle's luggage compartment above Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlán Colony, in Naucalpan County.
Early on the morning of Thursday, November 4, cooperatives discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots to the chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in a section of Villa Guerrero County.
Next to the body was a report signed by the suspected criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was murdered in Nezahualcoyotl by eight gunshots after he came out of his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two victims aged 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, in Ecatepec County, were killed by a gunshot to the head.
In Chalco, on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, the body of a man shot in the forehead was found, and under the body was found a shell casing from a gun of caliber 25.
In Ecatepec were found parts of the human body in a sewage canal in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
Rescue services carried out a thorough search for other parts of it, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlan reported finding the body with their hands tied back and their heads wrapped around the Pena Colorado site.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his neck.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bedding and left in the boot of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the Atizapán de Zaragoza district was reported, and death threats were also found among the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes County.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women wrapped in bed linen were found in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the Ixtapaluca district, and the next morning, a man killed in Huixquilucan wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, which was tentatively identified as Mario Ríos according to a report left by the killers near his body.
In Ixtapaluca, a lifeless woman was found in the San Francisco Acuautla settlement with two wounds to the back of her head.
A tattoo of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte was discovered on the skin of the woman, as well as necklaces with her effigy.
At the end of the month, the body of a man with at least a third gunshot wound and a report signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had their heads wrapped in tape were found and a report was also found in the municipality of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Among the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which said, "This will happen to those who do not conform."
Two bodies were found in Ecatepec that bore signs of torture and had limbs tied up inside an abandoned taxi outside the Justice Center in the San Agustin Colony.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl districts.
The first was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape, and had a message left with him; while the second was martyred and was found in a plastic wrapper in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Agents found a note along with it.
China sets goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
At the UN climate change conference COP16, the country’s representative assured that his country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and stated that he insists on his promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at the UN climate change conference, said.
In his first public speech at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country has made an enormous effort to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years.
But he said China would not change its goals and would continue to work with the international community on the matter.
China’s strategy on climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
He explained that progress has already been made on all of these issues, including last year’s approval of a new energy law that includes proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
He also stressed that in China, federal authorities worked in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, various multi-year plans are underway or have already been completed, funded by both the Chinese and other governments.
For example, it is the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been in place for the past five years and which has received investment from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, as well as a project to replace fluorescent lamps with energy-saving light bulbs and a mitigation and adaptation project.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert adviser on climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, greenhouse gas emissions per capita account for 6 tons in China, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Espino: César Nava
The National Leader of the PAN (Partido Acción Nacional) party stated that the former chairman of this party is entitled to demand his law from the National Order Commission.
The PAN party's national chairman, César Nava Vázquez, has assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos has been enacted, and that the party's former chairman is entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and demand his right.
In an interview that was taken before the state governor, Gabin Cué Monteagudo, objected, saying that the expulsion of Espin is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision by the Sonora Riot Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address his case through a complaint to the National Council Order Commission in order to make a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now was not the time to think about 2012, and that he had never been to the negotiating table on the alliance's presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that the PAN would come out of the internal elections held on the following 4 and 5 December, in which his successor would be elected, strengthened.
"This (2012 alliance) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not yet, it was a local election intention that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The chairman of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue are behind his party, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us", he added.
He said the committee could easily elect the best chairperson it deserves for the next three years, so he handed over the baton to "whom the committee will appoint."
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, and I am proud to hand over the office of the party chairman to any of the five."
He predicted that the party's rise in the last election in July would be reflected in future contests, although "there is not yet time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, rooted in the alliances of Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloa, would constitute a flag and would be subject to observation throughout the country, as "many expectations and aspirations are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to those expectations".
When asked about President Felipe Calderón’s criticisms by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) because of his four-year speeches, César Nava urged PRI members to think about the six-year terms of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Claderon, then let them start defending them, let them come out of their shells,” he said.
He said the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself, as he did during a speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no gag or censorship in this country.
Obama launches Twitter bill to support undocumented students
“If you think the Dream Act approval is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” the president tweeted.
President Barack Obama today, by posting on his personal Twitter account, joined a national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legalize undocumented students.
"If you think the passing of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it," Obama tweeted.
His short report draws attention to an internet link to a more comprehensive document asking the public to contact senators immediately as a vote on the bill approaches.
"As the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any law unless an extension to Bush-era tax cuts and government funding was approved.
Such a blocking, which was announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, it would be possible to compile a calendar for the rest of the projects.
“I think there’s still plenty of time...”
"We all agree that we need to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that we can reach an agreement on this at some point and then we can plan the order of the other issues," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a "closing debate" on the Dream Act, so a bill to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, though more likely next week.
A Senate bill would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, had resided in the country for the past five years, and were admitted to a higher education institution or the military.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve the bill, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so organizations of its adherents are conducting intense agitation to ensure that the bill is passed.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the bill.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act need to win several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the supporters are negotiating the most are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who added a mandate to Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who previously supported the Dream Act include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but said they would not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the bill, John Mccain, has not yet made a statement.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
"Poner el dedo en la llaga" ("To put a finger into a wound") is the equivalent of the Czech word "to hit a nail on the head."
The second round of the Pleasure of Language cycle was a promenade where participants performed a literary gala performance
"I understand that with Sex in the language, but... Finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to open the second round of Pleasure in the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another trade fair, she explained, they devoted themselves to the topic of Sex in the Language).
The finger in the wound "puts us in a tight spot", said the lovely Argentinean writer to the audience, composed mostly of young people, who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to listen to this round table debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Monterrey and Luise Garcia.
Luisa Valenzuel read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Schultz then called a great story, featuring Luisa in the first person as the protagonist, who, in search of knowledge, goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get answers, although the clues of the same story do.
From the infectiousologist leaves convinced: "Patience is not my strong suit, maybe it will be my blow".
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the journey but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents it really opened and the symbolic one is the scar".
The protagonist sighed slightly and concluded that "she only managed to learn so much about the wound that it is really open and that it does not exist", but she became convinced that pleasures and pitfalls in language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also spoke with a delightful narrative, which he called Praise of Invention, in which the finger in the wound is not named, but at one point appears.
with elements of magical realism tells of a famous witch who played the clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or corrected the virtue lost by one virgin, this narrative that then turned to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning there was not missing his own chroniclers who told it, and here is quoted by the captain of the period, Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the exaggerations of the narrative.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us, mocked the false testimony presented as real in the stories, but in no other way could he tell the story of America with a imagination that lacked even shame."
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have more imagination" and just where reality and lie merge, where one no longer knows what from the story belongs to one group and what to the other, the fictional literature reaches its peak.
He calls it the “Cervantian tradition.”
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monterová emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations made possible by the invitation to the International Book Fair with her talk Finger to the Wound.
The Cuban-Portorian writer pointed her finger at the great blow of social violence that runs through her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a silent compromise, which of course is not intended", she said after stating that the reality of the literature is a communication and dimension of the compromise that is being formed between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical reaction".
The evening concluded with the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that overflows with dogmatisms, one forgets that "there's a little no behind every yes, and there's a little yes behind every denial".
“To be the master of our thoughts and reality we must color: and to color means many times to put a finger in the wound and bother those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloration, and also to bother the authorities who prefer this black and white world,” he said to support the meaning of the writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has suffered three defeats in the final, both good and bad in his career, but he has already managed to achieve on three occasions in a crucial series.
In the Santos Laguna and Monterrey finals, there are also two different styles of techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano has suffered three defeats in the final, both good and bad during his career, but he has managed to achieve on three occasions on the decisive series, but until now he has left with no success, which is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, staying one step behind the winners and playing quaintly with the same team following the final.
The Santistic strategist reached his first final in the 2002 Apertura tournament when he held the reins of the Morelia club, with which he lost 4-2 overall against Toluca; then in the 2003 Clausura tournament he advanced to the decisive duel again and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with Santos Laguna in the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario, again against the "Devils" of Toluca, Rubén again suffered a defeat, although his team played against the "Smokers" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca) after 210 minutes of play, he suffered a 2-2 turnaround, after a series of penalty shots he got into the advantage of three to one and had two chances to play.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he can celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that for him the most important institution.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I'm committed to, and the title would obviously be for me, but the first one is the most important," the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
He has a vivid memory of the previous final, in which he has, as he confirms, learned a lot, "we learned the lesson that until the referee whistles the end, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we learned the lesson here until the match is over, we can't celebrate".
He is not concerned that this series could be decided in penalty shots, he trusts his players: "You never try to get a series of penalty kicks, you try to finish in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you need to be prepared for it, in the last tournament we were ready, unfortunately fate has prepared us for a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it".
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the other and experience the fame brought by titles for the first time.
The United States changed the rules for issuing visas
People will need to contact the Visa Services Centres before interviewing the Consular Section; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa process at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will need to contact the Visa Services Centres (ASC for short) before interviewing the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will collect the applicant’s biometric information and these will be evaluated by the Consular Department prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including:
The total cost of the visa will be lower, you will no longer have to pay a fee for the appointment, the second for the processing of the application and another for the delivery of the document by the shipping service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee to cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases with applications (including temporary workers visas), and $390 for a visa for merchants and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go through an interview with a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
As biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will require a second appointment with an interview at the Consular Department will spend less time there than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra $26 service fee.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. Space Agency has called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origin, evolution, spread, and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured that it would present "a discovery that will cause a turning point in the search for extraterrestrial life", prompting speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us who live in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and who could represent the possibility that they will one day become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that has been deemed too toxic for any form of life as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that it is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the true impact of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón beget opposition 'block'
Reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the advent of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary term has not even begun yet, when an opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by MPs from the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática), PT (Partido del Trabajo), Convergencia (Montigno de la Revolución Democrática) and Je som jednosti (The House of One).
Before the opening session of Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez's 60th parliamentary term, Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patrón Montalvo "smoothed" against the constitutional law reform as it scrapped them.
With this reform, they repeated, "Bapartism" begins, because now it will be two persons from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Council led by Salvador López Brito of the PAN (Partido Acción) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally create political marginality at the instigation of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) and the PAN.
He specified that in the coming days they would talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme based on political will, and if they did not have it, they would again be subjected to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When she came here, I'm looking at it because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even have the willingness to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said they were in agreement with the PRD, PT and Patrón and would therefore form a pluralist group.
It is impossible to allow, he went on, that Congress, after being monopolistic, would now be "dupole".
The aspiration of reforming the law is not that there should be endless bipartisanism in Congress.
The group is starting with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT party explained that currently Congress has become the "prey" of two - in allusion to the PAN and PRI parties.
“In the past, only one side controlled it, but today, two sides divide it.”
Patron Montalvo asked that the Member's personality be respected, that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"So that the five of us, who are likely to be nine, but who are now seeing us as five, will not remain outside, each in a different faction, because of the arched agreements, we have united to find a place at the table, because the problem is that we are not in the reform that they have formed and agreed with, and we do not agree with this reform."
Another 200 thousand pesos are issued for "supplier"
Mazatlán City Hall will pay another check discussed by the owner of the company supplying the electrical material.
Another check for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent by the town hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camacha Palazuelos.
This brings the amount paid in this second half to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the town hall, this last check, number 9258447, was sent on 16 November this year, it was issued in the amount of 200,144.56 pesos and its subject was listed "compensation of outstanding payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this contractor, who was monitored by the High State Audit Office for selling at high prices, an additional amount.
What has not been said is the total amount still owed to her by the town hall, and how many checks will be sent to Camacha Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, it only pays what we owe it, as well as other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last one on November 16.
Although the businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as stipulated by the law in the case of companies inspected by the High State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative bodies, the treasurer assured that she did not use the services of the town hall supplier again.
In the past, after July 25, the daily Noroeste published a review of checks issued by the town hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camacha Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
It also transacted with Jumapam, collecting checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist areas need maintenance.
Tourist managers complain in connection with the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Sánchez Tabooda stage in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist to a depression at the Sánchez Tabooda, the tourist sector in Mazatlán is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and do not show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Traders’ Association, said they had repeatedly asked for the impression of the destination, and the bad things tourists find there, to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He stated that the poor condition of streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk here and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea of the sales that are leaking, otherwise they wouldn't be dealing with these issues for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The town hall will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, it will have to do preventive maintenance, not just repair existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because even as residents we deserve a clean home, the town hall should change its strategy for maintaining the city."
There are other places that look neglected and pathetic, he noted, such as the Mazatlán Emblem and El Venadito.
"Nowadays, for tourists to come, it is not only about promotion that a good product needs to be offered, that is, a city rich in cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was not enough attention paid to this and these facts highlight something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is missing.
He spoke about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the city hall, saying that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to make it attractive because it has tourism potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, Sub-Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent as they are not used properly and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space, but it will first be necessary to put them in order in order to make these places more attractive and to put them on the list that we have to promote this destination."
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, would like MPs to take on a great responsibility by setting an example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary period full of decent work and with no agreements between the parties and the State Executive is being called for by the Mazatlán business sector, as Sinaloa is in turmoil and facing major challenges.
As of yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term has begun, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergence party and the last from the PVEM party, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations of new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and different areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalist patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), has proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on great responsibility and set an example on the road to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
"We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
Therefore, he spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridging to move the ruling forward in order.
"We want them to do decent work and above all be committed to society and sectors because it was the Sinaloa people who gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said one of the biggest challenges for the 40 national representatives will be to gather all the forces in order to achieve the country's economic growth, as the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is to encourage economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which in some way will support job creation."
As for tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing in currencies and investments that, moreover, directly compete with agriculture."
In addition, to spend funds on start-up tourist projects, Congress should help provide the state with the certainty and assistance with the Alcohol Act, which has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary terms.
Looking for Three Kings
Dolls, cars and bicycles, along with other toys, are on the children's wish list in the Coronado Valenzuel family.
Their parents will find it difficult to fulfill their expectations on the coming feast of the Three Kings, as their household consists of exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father does not have a steady job.
"Sometimes it's hard because my husband is not lucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the 'plebe' on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for 10-year-old José Alfredo, he has been wanting a "monster" car for some time, and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would like clothes in size for one year.
“He said to me, ‘I wish I had this monster car,’ but I said, ‘We’ll see, son,’ because it was very expensive,” Cayetano recalls.
For older children who were just in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, is a size 12, 10-year-old Isaías a size 10, while 8-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so he could use a pair of five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronado family Valenzuel, you can take part in the campaign "Looking for the Three Kings", and at the reception of the Noroeste newspaper to bring a gift or cash.
14 alleged drug traffickers who were arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people have been arrested and are facing various charges.
Inspections took place in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, mostly in places that served to produce drugs.
"Approximately 750 beds of Indian hemp, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Quebec police.
Eleven men and three women were arrested in total, both alleged bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested had to go to the Sherbrooke Palace of Justice following their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, possession with the purpose of trafficking it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These searches took place following a long-term investigation that lasted for almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," M. Ruel said.
This police operation involved 70 police officers from the regional unit investigating the city of Estrie State Police of Quebec, the State Police of Sherbrooke and the Police Administration of Sherbrooke Memphrémagog.
Illegal immigration can continue without any problems.
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships laden with illegal immigrants, will apparently be overpowered, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand upright on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a week-long session of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, which would allow the detention for up to a year of any person coming from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was heading towards the wrong goal.
“We are against it and all opposition parties seem to be against it, so we will see what the government does,” Duceppe said.
NPD critic on immigration issue, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that we should take action against the smugglers of illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be a core part of another bill, the C-35," Ms. Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it puts the blame on refugees and puts children in jail for at least a year,” Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties.
"Canadians are telling MPs en masse that they don't tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat it like some sort of sycophant."
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenney said.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative told the QMI agency that the government would ask for a vote so that any MP who opposed it would answer for his or her position in front of his or her constituents.
Unity does not mean unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public investigation commission on the issue.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil is working to ensure that this idea does not fall into oblivion: Québec intends to consult with the Department of Investigation in New York as early as January next year.
The Metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement surprised many of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil himself.
More was not needed for public safety critic PQ party leader Stéphane Bergeron to rate the announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of a hat" and "an amateur solution botched on his knee".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"He'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness hearing.
“Moreover, Mr. Charest is affirming that he doesn’t want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think he’s hiding something, just like you and me,” he explains.
"The only means of achieving the formation of a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Senior Civil Servants.
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposed to Quebec to grant special authority to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
He also believes Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as a commissioner, allowing them to force people to testify.
The creation of a standing working group is not the only proposal in the Charest government's writings.
Quebec would also follow Ottawa to change the Criminal Code so that it would be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the Commissioner for Operation Marteau (Hammer), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law on this kind of investigation is not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to this file.
Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers even though the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, arrested 131 people.
Ottawa subsequently had changes made to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under close supervision.
Several watercourses have come under tight control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi?re.
The road's sloping.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, i.e. from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 more millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, by region.
Sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were hardest hit.
A total of up to 100 millimeters could fall.
If we add up these precipitation with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we can be afraid of flooding in some watercourses.
The Quebec Rescue Service issued a flood warning for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudiere, on Wednesday evening.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in les Laurentides, and in Ch?ne, in Lotbini?re, have become subject to flood alert and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudi?re, heavy rainfall caused flooding of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was torn down due to heavy rains.
Two residences were evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the outpouring of some lakes from the banks caused the closure of some roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Emergency services are on standby and are overseeing the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Center for Flood Forecasting issued heavy flood warnings for several rivers on Wednesday, notably the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians and, as well as harsh language during broadcasts.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Council judges that Mr. Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance and inappropriate negative portrayals of Haitians of rude language that does not correspond to broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussions on suicide, including the transmission of the names of the two persons who took their own lives, did not violate the regulations for radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council received several complaints regarding comments made during the broadcasts, aired between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint by the Joint Front of Social Support Recipients of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts reported on the air were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not deceptive information.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought that suicide was a gesture of desperation.
Most members of the commission concluded that the message being transmitted was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission believes that the disputed episodes of the broadcast of 'Dupont's midday news' have come across a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
No reproach was made against him.
The latest controversy concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Thus, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort embarked on a media shootout that provoked many reactions.
The moderator of CHOI stated that he did not send any donation to help Haitians because we cannot know for sure that the needy will actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative image for Haitians.
"I have already atoned for my three-day reprieve of the matter."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use harsh language in its broadcasts.
Anyway, the CHOI-FM radio broadcast worked "beyond its responsibilities".
For the station, which will, inter alia, have to announce these decisions once during the main broadcast within a period of three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung fu of Montreal.
A resident of Montreal, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special finish.
An athlete who excels in kung-fu (full contact), kickboxing and Thai boxing, he enters tatami and ring clubs around the world in search of new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, Zemmal explained, who now lives in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I look for matches a little bit everywhere, because for those who don't like playing on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS, just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, from October 23 to 30, in Edimburg, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing, he stated."
"I am currently preparing for China for the San Shou World Cup."
"They were invited by opponents who finished in the top four at the last World Championships in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009".
"I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005".
"I finished fifth in the tournament in 2007 in China, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or next!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where punches and foot strikes, as well as tossing to the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of fighting, is an American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal has only one result in his career, he boldly confirms his participation in the "King of Sanda" supertournament, the Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, a nice guy explains."
"It's kind of equivalent to the Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The guy who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four contenders for the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"Semi-final winners to compete in final of their category".
"Then the winners of each category will compete to be crowned the only champion, the king of kung fu."
$450 million without public tenders
Hydro-Québec has agreed to $450 million in contracts with engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is the consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most important contract, the contract to manage the entire project for a total of $295 million without a public tender.
This consortium, named Énergie gérance, was authorized in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust to the private sector its responsibility for the management of this major hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
In early 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public tender.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of businesses presents us with a serious problem of an ethical nature that risks eliminating competition and triggering price increases.
"It's a new way to implement collusion and liquidate competition."
"This means that people no longer make side deals in secret, they are now doing them openly," PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he says he finds it hard to bear how the public interest can thus be sold.
The Secretary of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected in the afternoon, strongly denying that this contract was a collusion.
"I have my own way", she thundered, claiming that the PQ was "dishonest" and "lacked accuracy".
She said that "it would be the least I could do" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for a consortium is common practice all over the world.
It is usually a limited-time alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their mutual expertise in order to respond to a call for bids for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex due to the complexity of the work.
Construction is underway and must be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of engineering consultancy consortia is under investigation in the government.
If we move quickly through the register of Quebec companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors; let’s name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
Regarding the Énergie Gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is characterised by a particular dynamism of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will make us shrug off the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a tender and there are few bidders, your bids may be higher."
"You have two choices: that is, you take the people who are involved in the contract as participants in the competition, and that you say, 'Let's make a deal satisfactory and at a good price.'
"But the main idea is that the important thing is not the price, but the competence of the people," Mr Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the Énergie Gérance consortium is part of a long list of more than $50,000 contracts received by the Party of Quebec.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 contracts for engineering consultancy concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with soil analysis laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin collected 22 contracts, of which Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a stake in the "Énergie gérance".
All contracts have been concluded.
They total $449,783,344, including a $295,131,564 contract with Énergie Gérance.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Secretary Normandeau leaked the news that PQ is also linked to companies that are "funding" her, before clarifying that they are more her executives.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in "impartial" brands and environmental certifications, to be guided accordingly when choosing products.
The worst part is that even when we bathe in a media universe that urges and urges us to consume more responsibly, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, a failure that it qualifies even as a brake on its commitment, states Barometre of Responsible Consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebec residents who try to sell them still do not trust them very much
In fact, two-thirds of us say we don’t trust environmental promises, simply because green advertising by companies is figuring out a measurement tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke’s Observatory for Responsible Consumption.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates given for so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that identify as environmentally responsible, Barometry reports.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this topic is accepted as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption appears to be paramount in stimulating this aspect of consumption, which is currently revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of the information would ease the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromatre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of Quebec’s population is distrustful of the product or “green” services we’re looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, change the brand of one or several products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
Sixty-one percent preferred to buy from merchants in their neighborhood, and they preferred to buy food grown in their region, according to Baromitre.
More "green" and responsible - the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 out of a maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québek likes to present himself as the king of recycling, striving for the least possible impact on the environment by caring for the protection of animals.
But their social and ecological consciences apparently remained somewhere outside their car, Baromatre reports: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebec residents said they use public transport or that they recommend using a car to drive at least two people, in the interest of nature conservation.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested to participate financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Paralléle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Paralléle", which sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy the Saint-Laurent Boulevard cinema complex, and which proved its mission as a film-lover, did not get what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the government of Quebec proposes a loan, the amount of which would be lower, some of which was the original expectations, which could build the basis for a viable solution on favorable terms and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and the demand for $12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised for reductions.
The proposal and plan of action was sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Entrepreneurship in Culture (SODEC), Francois Macerola, who manages the cinema project eXcentris.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
They have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must indeed be rejected.
Recall that the Quebec Cinema Owners Association opposed direct investment by the State in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, concluding that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the discussion called for substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, was given film art in his cinemas during ten years after he financed the construction of the complex himself, which may have been the reason for the change on the part of the state's financial council.
The lack of halls for independent films is gaudy in Montreal, and eXcentris has been able to gain a steady clientele.
Angus et le Paralléle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will earn $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three film companies, Le Paralléle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on 27 February next year and screen Xavier Beauvois's most beautiful film Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not mention Le Devoir and so he and his group think about the proposals for reduction that are being made to him.
Raised the curtain on Canada as a whole...
The new U.S. diplomatic sources known through WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians vis-a-vis Americans, but at the same time reveal their sense of superiority to Canada.
U.S. diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when they go to vote, and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
In addition, four new reports between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were released to the public yesterday, provide sensitive details to get under each other’s skin.
The announcement, dated September 22, 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details at what point the United States is not part of the bets being discussed by political leaders.
Much to the surprise of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
“The Canadian Inferiority Complex, almost entrenched, makes it possible for political leaders to talk about internal stakes instead of realizing that these elections also apply to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” she writes.
“The United States is, therefore,” he concluded, “the proverbial elephant in this election: pervasive, but potentially too threatening to be talked about.”
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less as the two countries maintain intense political and economic ties.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party, or even better, a party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure the government's retention in a confidence vote in early February regarding the federal budget by which Canada publicly admits its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery plan," Breese writes.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to adjourn the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition, and that opposition parties condition their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, highlights Washington's increasingly negative image of the United States throwing drama series airing on CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not very savvy references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or kidnappings for the purpose of forced interrogations at the CIA can be observed.
In their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to take some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it said, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent, to the Secretary of State."
"Secretary accepted, saying she would review file".
Finally, let us note that the people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed".
Mike Huckabee in the United States heard about it.
The Global Roadmap for Lighting Restoration
The United Nations has proposed a plan to restore home lighting, shop lighting and industrial space in 100 countries in order to limit the greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one-third of the additional limitation that must be achieved to stabilize the planet’s climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to promote in Cancún to compensate for the lack of hard-to-fulfill commitments to reduction on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if we replace the incandescent bulbs that monopolize 50 to 70% of the market with fluorescent or, even better, electroluminescent light bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet generated due to lighting would be eliminated.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That’s the equivalent of 70 percent of the world’s car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should allow GES global emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But another 5 Gt will have to be subtracted from this balance in order to achieve a stabilization of climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 so that it can be ruled out from being out of control.
In hot bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat, and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluorescent lamps, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with new bulbs with DEL, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, which were introduced into Philips production this week - the company reportedly participated in the UN study - have an estimated lifetime of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot bulb, giving us an idea of a possible savings with a replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have voiced reservations about fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless producers set up collection points.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluocompact light bulb, but rather thermal coal-fired power plants that emit many of the mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in hot light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centers put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation each year.
The report also detailed the gains that would be made from this international program by each country.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year by purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants worth $2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the elections.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, called for the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and report the preliminary results without delay, a spokesman for the President of the United Nations stressed."
"It asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the Electoral Commission let the latest date - Wednesday midnight - pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's scrutiny.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the CEI president confirmed on television that the commission was "continuing work" to be able to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara, have multiplied around the world.
But Camp Gbagbo has relied on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for a "fraudulent" vote in the north, administered by former New Army (FN) insurgents since the failed September 2002 coup d'état.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that voter intimidation maneuvers practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country discouraged supporters of the Côte d'Ivoire's president from going to the polls.
The election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council took into account complaints filed by Gbagbo.
But opponents of President Gbagbo believe the country’s supreme court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N’Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to claim victory.
Its allies confirm that Gbagbo blocks publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the Electoral Commission from broadcasting the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, held on Sunday, was seen as the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivory Coast political group that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, on 31 October, as the winner with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassano Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter.
France’s unemployment rate, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), according to provisional figures with seasonal variation correction (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed reached 2.631 million in the capital.
The figures for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France are not working in the third quarter, but would like to work, regardless of whether they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether they are looking for a job or not.
The situation of current young people in the labour market has escalated with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were out of work.
As for the elderly, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), that is, 482,000 people over 50 years of age and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 saw the benefit of unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% across France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following controversy over its calculation method.
By contrast, Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency, continues to produce monthly statistics, announcing a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini is charged and taken into custody.
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste treatment companies and a brother of PS Bouches-du-Rhône Board of Trustees, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of a public procurement investigation, alleged to have been surreptitiously obtained.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with misappropriation of company assets, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, provision of bribes, taking bribes to influence the office, and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guerini is a fighter and insists that he and the judge explain to him all the questions that he intends to ask, and not any illusions."
"It's easy to persecute him for many reprehensible reasons, but it's another thing to prove them," Florence Rault, his attorney, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini said through his lawyers that he had sent a brief statement to the judge before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his close associates, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything other than ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
As regards the award of contracts or the destination of funds linked to their functioning, he was never aware of any of this, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was charged on Wednesday with misappropriation of public funds and plot, and left at large, under judicial supervision with no contact, the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that are being reproached against him."
"The investigating judge takes this into account and leaves him at large," his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux, said.
Four others were charged and released on Tuesday night, saying they were under judicial supervision over two of them, prosecutor Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for taking bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "the theft and misuse of company property", the other for "a plot in the misuse of public funds".
Finally, Alexander Guérini's business associate, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "concealing the misuse of the company's assets".
Among those confronted by Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company helped launder money from widespread gangsterism.
The investigation is being conducted as part of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009, following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in public procurement, particularly in the matter of waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and the functioning of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the Marseille Municipal Community (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysee Palace exaggerated Syria mediation
In more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the lot of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage," unified views in France, put diplomacy on combat alert, and emphasized relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this is closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
U.S. documents, received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde, reveal some of the drawbacks of this crisis.
They describe how the Élysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian jailed in France and wanted by the U.S. justice system for smuggling material in favor of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they are putting a spotlight on the way the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
He didn't really do anything about it.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on 12 August 2009 has the headline: "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
An adviser from the Élysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, Francois Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the U.S. Secretary of State Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do just as much in order to bring back their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "constantly pronounce emphatically" in the media the words "fundamental rights of man", "innocence", "immediate deliverance".
The Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, must be brought into trouble.
“Do it the more they ask you to stop.”
Since attempts have been made to negotiate through discrete channels, "silence will solve nothing", the Iranians are "masters of evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purpose of "political blackmail".
She announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day the French embassy will give her sanctuary) "will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (a deposit of 230,000 euros).
And they will announce that the Elysee Palace is anticipating the hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will intensify".
The Iranians “could arrest an additional 1,800 French nationals living in Iran in the future,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
The information is spreading: Majid Kakavand, an Iranian who the United States claims has been expelled for illegally trading electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris at the discretion of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing consensus.
For Washington, which pursues Iran’s illegal networks to obtain material destined for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France agreed to negotiate?
Freeing an Iranian for freeing a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Francois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Élysée Palace, he states, was not only "struck by the judge's decision", but was looking for an opportunity to oppose it.
"There were talks between the presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michaele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court", he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of French intelligence.
An adviser to the Élysée dials the telephone number, hangs up the telephone handset and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy.
At the time of Clotilde Reiss' imprisonment in Iran, the Élysée Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communiqués and organized "escapes" to the media, to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blur" of French officials".
What is the basis of such a degree of "gratitude" expressed towards M. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their statements, full of laudatory French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done".
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Élysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
The intense communication is “moving towards the validation of President Sarkozy’s policy of opening up Syria,” he analyzes.
The policy implemented in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad, and marked as premature and undeserved".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris is trying to “demonstrate to Syria what lauders can earn by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, Francois Richier confided to him, "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is"
"But we still thanked them."
"This should at least bring confusion and confusion among the Iranians".
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Élysée Palace.
In the communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
The end of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called “Pecival” that will ban adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to online games after midnight for people under the age of 16, officials from the Culture Ministry and the Family Ministry said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and are unable to lead normal lives during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the department's senior official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also expected to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make free programs available to people who request it, allowing them to limit the time they spend on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "affected" countries, and the daily newspaper regularly reports various facts associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: Fifa sets up host countries.
Full of unrest over suspected corruption, the Fifa executive committee establishes a 2018 and 2022 World Cup host country on Thursday, choosing a sovereignly politically motivated one where the fight for influence and lobbying risk being overtaken by technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the Royal Fifa Competition in 2018 will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue to be set in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities participating in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an idea of the scale of economic and political betting around the world.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations run the risk of going on until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy by candidates.
According to the Fifa Assessment Report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) dossiers contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the voting hour.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelations leading to the suspension of two members of the CE (European Commission) for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have ruined the chances of their country, the cradle of football, which has only hosted the World Cup once in a year.
The BBC gave the crown to it on Monday when it aired a documentary that "stuck on a pin" three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa unsatisfied and put England's leaders at odds with David Cameron in the first place.
The prime minister hopes to repeat the move made by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who won the London 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new shine to its name with the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the pair of Spain-Portugal is not missing trumps of already prepared stadiums, its appreciation (the 1982 World Cup in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided not to move the championship to Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal allusions barely skewed at the accusations of the English press against the members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them," Mr Poutin said.
For 2022, the United States seems to be the logical favorite with its considerable 1994 experience.
The world’s top economy, home to Fifa’s major sponsors, seems to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have done a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for both countries, which together passed the "test" in 2002.
Another threat: awarding the 2026 World Cup to China, which Fifa fervently wants, has made Asia’s chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar pulling a big ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new landscapes, but the two countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pay for the flimsy TV fees (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, forming a driving force for Fifa.
Second mandate: clarity (assurance)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterand seemed to hesitate.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
Mandate to the Élysée Palace calls someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of secrecy associated with the presidency.
Therefore, it is necessary to act as if the doubts persist.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, friends of Jacques Chirac made claims that a third term would not be ruled out.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy said, “I will make a decision sometime in the autumn of 2011.”
As the UMP recalls in front of members of parliament on Wednesday evening at the Elysee Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has sown a little feverish state.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far off.
The President merely recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he recalls the humorous tone of the presidential election in such meetings.
"In the worst case, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
The May 2010 rebellion: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His statements the day before yesterday will not make him a candidate any more than the day before; he will not make him a candidate any less.
If they make comments, it is because of a double truth.
Speeding up the road to candidacy to PS, on the one hand.
But this is not the entrance to the arena of Ségolon Royale, which is pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in PS want to organize into combat formations rather premature than intended.
Bad research, on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would have preferred Francois Fillon's candidacy over Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP," people from the Prime Minister's immediate vicinity responded immediately and scrupulously.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run," Raffarin said.
"He will still believe he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with the obvious.
Euro: Central European Bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Bank was intended to be an opportunity to specify the conditions for exiting the crisis or, at least, the announcement of the halt to a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European debt obliges, the Securities Institute will no doubt not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation already so tense on the European securities markets.
In this case, the political cost would be much higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in the resolution of the European sovereign debt crisis.
She did not want to say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example, by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...)".
The night before, in Brussels, during his questioning of the European Parliament's economic and monetary affairs committees, the president of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not turn out to be more eloquent in terms of his intentions, and he contented himself with stating that the program of buying state titles in the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see how we decide" during the session that takes place this Thursday.
The only certainty: The central European bank will keep its basic interest rate constant at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, bond purchases made by the Central European Bank have doubled to nearly 1.35 billion euros in the last week.
And thanks to the unwiseness of the market negotiators, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among market negotiators about the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect any significant change in the exchange rate.
If the operations of loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the Central European Bank, the latter shall proceed to the unrestricted provision of liquid funds under generous conditions and for a duration of between one week and three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine her changing her schedule in any significant way."
“If not, it would mean accepting the risk of triggering a short-term new tension,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"The progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its interventions in the public debt market, “the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of its bond purchases to revive the weak market,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It needs to make up for the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the flare-up of paid performance by the states that are among the most fragile," a senior bond administrator said yesterday.
Because if interest rates take off, countries will be all the more worried about reducing their debt, rather than stabilizing it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
Berlusconi's back in Italy
After the beginning of the week, the worrying situation eased a bit for Italy, yesterday with a 10-year backflow of bond interest.
Return to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for the Economy, the region's presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as "unsolvable" and that he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then denied the participants.
In any case, Tuesday’s deviation from long German interest rates reached a record 210 basis points, and the price of CDS contracts skyrocketed to 263 points, causing some upheaval in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with "the tumultuous development of the markets" and a possible contagion originating in Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that he’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the lack of growth and lackluster fiscal inputs, which go hand in hand, putting the state at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the government deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new summary of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, in the amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken," said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For the moment, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
“The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund’s Board of Directors under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
“There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, the NDLR), the stabilisation efforts required in Italy are less than those required of other countries,” notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OCDE’s chief economist.
There is still the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections scheduled for the end of March could begin to be organised.
This would open up a period of little time to take a decision in a case of serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde said in a press conference in Paris: “I think the Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday all day and night, they are obviously very supportive, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone.”
Although everything is relative, yesterday’s recorded expansion in terms of interest on European sovereign bonds has brought water to the mills of governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's notation office has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt record, a target most targeted by various speculations.
“Because there is a real lack of transparency and clarity in May, based mainly on banking systems,” economists Exane BNP Paribas said.
“Political time is slower than market time.”
Aware of this discontinuity and the dangers it conceals, European countries are intensifying the debate aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most affected by the issue and, more broadly, with their G20 counterparts are progressing very well.
This is in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings from the beginning of next week.
The European Central Bank is meeting today.
The fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets is on the agenda (see above).
As for the European Fund of Finance (FESF), its CEO, Klaus Regling, embarked on a trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of this journey is not to increase funds, it certainly paves the way for achieving this goal.
The first issue of the FESF securities is expected next month.
A U.S. official told Reuters yesterday that the United States would support a possible increase in mobilised funds through additional direct engagement with the FMI.
Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that join strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid are different than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before they apply their own budgetary corrections and decide on the structural reforms necessary to regain their continued confidence.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the process of normalizing sovereign bond markets.
On his way to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to touch the stock of securities again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, an actor in the very first European sovereign-claims trade plan, believe that adding around 100 billion euros would be enough, “preferably” in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The facility exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidised to this day by 60 billion euros.
A Council that has every chance of being tried in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are deteriorating.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have orange alert.
Snow rations still cause traffic problems, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that they will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties now have orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sôvres a la Vienne, joined the 20 districts already having a declared orange emergency, 18 as early as Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne a la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, significant snowfall causes problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and weak snowfall on the Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistere, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snowstorms are big enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some districts banned heavy goods traffic - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route of Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police, and police recommend driving your vehicle only when it is really necessary, and the traffic of some trucks has been canceled for the day.
In Picardy, school connections were banned for Thursdays.
No special measures are foreseen to restrict freight traffic on Wednesday evenings.
The county office "calls on all car drivers to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt the driving to the nature of the roadway".
The DGAC has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy Airport and 10% at Orly Airport on Thursday due to expected snowfall.
DGAC recommends air passengers to contact their airline.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Billions have been raining since the debate over modernising transport on the Ile-de-France is in full swing.
At least during the discussion.
It is worth $23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the state announced the provision of a subsidy of 4 billion euros.
In theory, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source for the contracts.
Today we come to the first amendment.
The Finance Rectification Act 2010, which is being examined by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the office tax on Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "in favour of the public institution of the Société du Grand Paris".
It is quantified: "The yield on this interest is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the refurbishment of the office rate, which already exists "to modernise it, to increase the yield obtained from it and to make this increase affect Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A mirage.
This is not stated in the text.
We're a long way from $4 billion.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euros in capital subsidies that will be mobilized by the state and put into the Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
We at SGP do not find this system shocking.
“From the moment we created the revenue (both taxes, ndlr) we can cover the studies for three years and then rake in up to 4 billion,” he explains.
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as needed".
SGP believes that $4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised belong to the not-yet-attended subscribers, runs the risk of sparking a rather busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Vengeful hackers and industrious spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is revealed, a scandal that appears to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens, and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and anticipates a future dominated by regression.
But let's move on.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the secret service (of any nation) consists entirely of press cuts.
The Americans’ “extraordinary revelations” about Berlusconi’s sex-lifestyle are heralded by what everyone has been able to read in any newspaper for months (all but the two Berlusconi’s own), and the infamous caricature profile of Gaddafi has long been the subject of sketches for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret documents can only consist of reports already known is fundamental in the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Masons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
Not only because the author of occult texts does not like to look for new information (he does not even know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who are engaged in occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
That's Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
The same goes for secret documents.
An informer is a lazy, lazy (or limited spirit) head of the secret services (and if he isn’t, he could be, I know, an editor in the Libération newspaper) who only considers what he admits to being true.
The highly classified information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy sent to the state department was the same one Newsweek had published the week before.
Why, then, has there been so much fuss about the revelations about these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, that embassies, at least since the end of World War II and since heads of state can make phone calls or fly off to dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representative exercises, have transformed into spy centers.
Any spectator watching movies about the investigation knows very well that it is only out of hypocrisy that it is seemingly ignored.
However, the fact that it is repeated publicly defames the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most highly classified information of the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, not an insignificant one, to the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and their "executors".
But let's move on from there to the profound truth of what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's time, it was possible to embrace all power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven ever since, thanks to the ability to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used and so on, the citizen became a complete victim of a wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate, as is happening now, that even the “graves” with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of some hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the avenger of a citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can he maintain a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that the real secret is a meaningless secret (and a meaningless secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is really a mysterious, meaningless secret because it is pulled from public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were meaningless secrets to him, means power to him.
WikiLeaks made no mistake about Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this blow to the powers that be?
It is clear that in the future states will not be able to send sensitive information online - that would be equivalent to posting it on a poster posted on a street corner.
But it’s also pretty obvious that with current technology, it’s pointless to hope that you can keep messages secret over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future?
I know my prognosis is science fiction for the moment, and it’s fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials transporting themselves discreetly through uncontrollable routes carrying only those messages they know by heart, or rather, hiding precious information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in key-closed drawers: all in all, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways, that is, backwards.
A century after wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated wire-based telegraph (telephone).
Videocassettes (analogues) allowed cinema lovers to shoot a movie step by step, moving it forward and backward, and uncovering all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digital) only allow them to jump chapters, that is, macroportions.
Via high-speed trains we arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while to travel by plane and transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
It is therefore not uncommon for politics and communication techniques to revert to horse-drawn vehicles.
One final note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what had been orchestrated in secret at the embassy.
Now it is the embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it’s time to test the promise of fast-start or early-start financing made by developed countries.
And the great French hacks have been exposed
Under the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros for three years and France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million euros per year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU pulled a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: a report detailing the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation invaluable and valued for its real value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do them equally and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has mobilised 2.2 billion euros in 2010, putting it on track to deliver on its 7.2 billion euro pledge in 2012.
But if we look at the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Accord to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without harming Public Aid for Development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some member states, including France, blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission took 2009 as a reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million for three years of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment terms or with terms at the level of public aid for development.
France, on the other hand, considers that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no reference to expenditures of previous periods or to the global level of Public Aid for Development d'Aide publique au développement.
Specifically, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries can remain unchanged (or even decrease), to keep its commitment to funding “new and additional”...
Another crucial element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider 1x borrowed to be equal to 1x donated.
Evidently, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be substantiated for some investments that are profitable (often projects involving emission reductions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not understand it by virtue of our commitments, but as the price of a loan to a creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France can only give such a justification: it is "complying" with its commitment of 420 million euros, of which 91.5% is a loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% is donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the world that uses such a loan.
Germany requested 46% of the donations, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) kept their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives 1 euro to make good on its promise, France only gives 10 centimes and considers this effort comparable.
What a beautiful piece of juggler!
To sum up, in its financing of the "fast start" France operates with double cheating: on the one hand, with the development of the stock over time, and on the other hand, with the real financial burden.
Although it spends only 36.1 million euros, it manages to convince that it spends 420 million euros "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the finance minister (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would member states continue to donate when they only need to lend?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The pre-financing chapter is only a small question mark, relatively short-lived, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of pre-financing.
First of all, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and decency and fairness towards other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid a discussion about deposits in long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): we will not escape the question of 'additionality' or how loans are booked.
France should change its position to become as progressive with these deposits as it is with others.
So everyone is putting their hope in the new environment minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who is coming to Cancun next week.
The surprise announcement of France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in discussions.
Pesticides that children ingest.
A 10-year-old child will one day ingest 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Movement for the Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value due to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the issue being processed", bought food commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack for one child roughly ten years old in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical dishes, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as confectionery, were analyzed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as interfering for the endocrine glands (PE), according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Center for Cancer Research.
“Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we can well see in our research that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, perhaps carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking,” the association says.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain about ten résidences with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as is the case with about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
Imported from Brazil, the apple, reported in the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same is true for green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, for which studies have found traces of powerful insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat steak, canned tuna, and even bun and chewing gum were laced with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
Salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave failed to avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this "cocktail of contaminants" is likely to be underestimated," the study concludes.
The Green Europe-Greens Association (EE-LV) has proposed to "face the emergency" by setting up a moratorium on pesticide use to stop the "increase in civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the status of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
