According to the Tatoeba guidelines, members are advised to either add sentences in their native language or translate from a language they understand into their native language.

I found out my bike was gone.
Did you find out how old Tom is?
She got so sick from the bus ride that she started vomiting.
I'm disappointed in you.
You failed Tom.
Who are you afraid of?
Check if you forgot anything.
Check it for me, please.
I've tried everything.
I've tried everything.
Son of a bitch!
Experience brings wisdom.
She tried on her own.
I tried everything.
He tried to attract her attention.
I'll try to do something about it.
Try to have some compassion.
Try not to be stupid.
Try talking to the police.
Try it yourself.
Try not to take too much.
Try to control yourself.
Try this!
Try to explain it to Tom.
Try again.
The evil witch cursed the man and turned him into a bug.

Bad people will be arrested and tried for their crimes.
She made him angry.
I'm mad at Tom.
The criminals managed to escape.
The criminal tracked Tom down and killed him.
You broke your leg.
He changed the address.
Did I miss something?
It is not excessive on my part.
She disappeared into the dark.
He disappeared without a trace.
He disappeared into the crowd.
He disappeared from the face of the earth.
Get out!
They blew it.
He knows them.
He knows them.
Self-knowledge is the beginning of all wisdom.
We've known Tom for years.
I know him, but I don't know his name.
I know him, and that's why I don't trust him.
I know him very well because I saw him often in his father's office.
I know his name.
I only know a few words.
I know her by name.
I know both girls.
I know the truth.
I know the real reason you're here.
I know Tom's wife.
I know the area.
I know your little brother very well.
Rape is a terrible crime.
You know me well enough to know that I wouldn't do that.
Do you know any of these men?
You know everyone here, don't you?
Do you know the longest word in your language?
How Would You Answer?
He knows the place like he owns a pair of shoes.
Anybody here know this guy?
He knows wine.
Pollution can be regulated.
For some reason, I feel more alive at night.
Suddenly, the captain left the ship.
She abused my ignorance.
I'm being abused.
You are abusing your authority.
Destroy your enemies: make them your friends.
You'll be happy again.
I told them to turn the radio down again.
I'll read it again.
There was snow and rain in the sky.
Juggling is another thing I'm not very good at.
They messed up.
They sing in the choir.
She sang a song, smiling at me.
I wasn't attracted to her at first.
A cat came from under the desk.
Two boys came from the room.
The news of Tom's death saddened me.
I've caused him a lot of trouble.
She betrayed me, I'm disappointed.
A ripe apple fell from a tree.
I got hurt.
The mirror's plowed.
The mirror's foggy.
The mirror broke.
They set up a new company in London.
I rarely see you and Tom.
I was just thinking about something.
I was about to write a letter when he came home.
They ruined my life.
I'd cancel all the slaughterhouses if I could.
You canceled the meeting.
Cancel the meeting.
Cancel the meeting.
She blushed her face.
We can get a lot of valuable information from this book.
You're getting fat.
I wouldn't joke about that.
Tom is now a man.
He's wasting his time.
The loss of the job she loved so much was a blow to her.
We've lost all our gear.
He lost her.
I lost the umbrella Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost the umbrella Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost my key.
I lost all my friends.
You lost your head, didn't you?
He lost two sons in the war.
You're wasting your time.
Losing the job she loved so much was a big blow to her.
She blunted the knife.
They were involved.
I took part in the debate.
I took part in the search.
I'd stay and talk, but I have to go.
They stayed in Tennessee.
We stayed quiet.
Stay home.
Will you stay or will you leave?
Will you stay or will you leave?
Stay where you are, or I'll kill you.
Stay with us!
You stay here and lock the door.
Stay here!
Stay home and don’t go anywhere.
Stay home.
I'll stay with her.
I'll stay at the motel.
I'm staying with you.
Curiosity won out over me.
Raise your hands before you answer.
Get out of your chair and help!
You're invited.
We can do better.
Can you do it yourself?
Can you do it yourself?
Can you do it yourself?
I chose the path of least resistance.
My phone is ringing!
The bells rang.
The bells started ringing.
They messed up.
I twisted my ankle.
We get used to everything.
I'm getting used to it.
Habit is second nature.
I used to live alone.
I used to win.
He's used to not having hot food every day.
You get used to everything.
You'll get used to it.
