Petr Cech: Transfer at the last minute?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big change.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently Chelsea’s substitute goalkeeper, is not on top of his new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the NH Hotel in Smíchov, talks to Czech journalists and is preparing with the Czech national team for a game dress-up with the Americans and then for a sharp start to the Euro 2016 qualifier against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea, Thibaut Courtois takes first place in the Premier League in the new season, and for the first time in ten years, Čech has become a substitute at the London club.
It has been speculated that Real Madrid may be interested in the Czech Republic.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup to Atletico at the start of the season and failed to make it into the league season by losing 2-4 to San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about Paris SG's interest.
He scored two wins and two draws for the French league season, shooting out St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
The most popular shoe is the AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and broke up with Lille amicably 1:1 over the weekend.
News broke today on English tabloid websites that Czechs might want to join Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Czech’s departure from Chelsea at the last minute is unlikely.
Skybet put him on a 4-1 course.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your jersey in the next few hours?
I don’t know about that, but there’s never 100% in football.
During the day, there may be an offer you can’t refuse.
What would such an offer look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know yet, what an offer that can't be turned down actually looks like.
First of all, it would depend on the position of Chelsea, whether the club would deal with any offer or not.
Is it technically possible to make such a transfer while you are in Prague?
Do you need to sign a new contract in your new location?
That's not what I was thinking.
But there are a lot of players in this situation today, everyone is somewhere at the national team meetings and certainly a lot of transfers will be closed today.
So it would certainly be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet can afford you?
I really don't know.
Are you not pushing yourself to leave?
The situation where I didn’t catch in the first three matches of the new season is new for me after 15 years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want to continue to take part in the fight for Chelsea’s goalkeeper position and it is up to the coach who chooses which decisions he will make over the coming weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision-making?
I take into account all the factors.
Of course, the sport aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, to which the needs of the family naturally belong.
Is it possible that you could play for another club in England?
That's a question I thought would never involve me.
Anything is possible in football.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe on his first major visit since winning the election in May to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world’s third-largest economy.
The list includes, first and foremost, plans for greater cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
India also hopes the two nations agree to cooperate on defense issues.
Karrata police arrest 20-year-old after motorcycle chase
They stopped the bike after it ran 125 km/h through a zone with a maximum speed of 70 km/h and drove into the bush to escape the police.
The patrol traffic police tried to stop a blue motorcycle at the side of the road in Karrata this morning when they noticed it driving 125 km/h as it exited the gas station at Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then turned into the bush, leaving the policemen out of sight.
A motorcycle and a person matching the driver's description were then spotted at a house in Walcott Way, Bulgara.
Karrathi police have charged the 20-year-old with disobeying a call to halt and recklessly driving.
He will stand trial in Karrata on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will be tried on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was made aware of the charge during a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman on 7 June 2013 at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
According to claims, Webster attacked her while "she was unconscious, asleep, and in no condition to give her consent."
Webster is also being prosecuted for raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set the date for her trial at the Edinburgh High Court on 17 November.
Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill to protect union organizing as a civil right.
“Based on how unions work, middle-class jobs work,” says Ellison, a Democratic senator from Minnesota who is co-chair of the Congressional committee.
That's why I'm so proud to introduce an Employee Empowerment Act along with John Lewis' pattern of occasional rights.
This ground-breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination when organizing in trade unions as other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-union forces
Adjusting the Labor Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination to join unions, to stand trial in civil court - and to sue for compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents are proposing in the bill is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite trade-union struggles in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to adopt, expand, and respect labor rights.
There was a time, and millions of Americans still remember it, when the country in one breath championed democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja's military autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, included language, and openly recognized that "the right of employees to assemble, to bargain collectively, and to act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Realizing that employees would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, the Germans included a clause that openly states: “The right to form associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
Arrangements that will limit this right or seek to damage it will be revoked. Measures to fulfill such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the draftsmen and Roosevelt included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form and join unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to build a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to form labor unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that trade unions have not diminished the strength of a nation, but have expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to an unsuspected level.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History never forgets and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis restore the ideals that have lifted America and made it a true promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily blocks bill that could shut down all Louisiana abortion clinics
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that lawyers say would likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
The ordinance, signed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, would require abortion doctors to have the right to admit a patient to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge’s ruling means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions and must obtain permission in the meantime.
“The proposing party will be able to legally conduct its business and in the meantime, it will obtain a permit,” federal judge John deGravelles said in a statement.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month so that the judge can make a more permanent ruling on the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, and said it would give doctors more time to get permission.
“Today’s decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from the insidious law that is designed to deprive them of their health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit seeking to block the law on behalf of three of the five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also involved doctors from two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, and they are also asking for this permission.
Louisiana is among eleven states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas bill that would shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Campaigners for women’s rights to abortion, along with the American Obstetricians and Gynecologists Association and the American Medical Association, argue that the need for such a permit places demands on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion objected by saying the measures were aimed at protecting women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed because of the measures.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said only one abortion doctor in Louisiana has a permit.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, the doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear for his safety, the group said.
Louisiana authorities said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while they wait for the application to be processed.
Ovarian cancer kills more often in rural areas due to late diagnosis and poor access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video in tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QiMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs May Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers followed the women through seven years of treatment.
Dr Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by women's age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rates occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that factors may be late diagnosis and poor access to treatment.
“The disease is best treated by gyneco-oncologists, who usually reside in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improvements in long-distance medical services to overcome the barrier of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transportation services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are healing away from their family and friends.
Dr Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographical location, underscoring the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, Elisha Neave, a young mother from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary decline of homeowners under 35 could lead to a loss of up to 10 million pounds a year when today’s young generation of consumers reaches “the main age groups of gardeners”.
According to the report, renters spend an average of 55% of the amount they spend on their own gardens.
As other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated five billion pounds a year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front gardens used as parking space, and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, one household has the lowest spending on horticultural products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society have stated that subletting or lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Horticultural Advisor for RHS, said: “The tenants are very fond of growing potted plants - when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the “golden age” of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher proportion of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales this year due to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern Dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin, at a meeting of his youth organization, which reminds me most of the Hitler Youth, rattled with atomic weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that he didn’t care about their opinions, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be mastered both by an intense nationalism, and that they can transform the inferiority complex into imperialist appetites.
Time seems to pass differently in the east than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of wars for domination of Europe was long gone, the East, on the contrary, thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and need to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis seized power, and then followed an explosion of nationalism unlike today’s situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, beating up journalists, eliminating uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, that is indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russians, probably misses the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled before them.
Perhaps Western politicians were to blame for this, maybe they patted Vladimir on the shoulders little, maybe they didn’t invite him where he wanted, and maybe they began to underestimate him, and he just behaved like a typical Russian mule.
He put his house in order, pretended that he didn’t really want to go anywhere, and sharpened knives at home.
Now he has decided to regain his lost positions.
He starts slow, he has time.
He's probably a leader for life, so where would he be in a hurry?
He trampled the Caucasus, now he tramples the Ukrainians, then there are the dwarves from the Baltics.
They've been biting the Russian bear's fur long enough.
China, which seems to be jumping up and down a bit, is sure to notice this by now.
And those Germans are really pissing off Vladimir about how well they're doing, and we put that on their ass at 45.
How about making one new Novorossiya in Karlovy Vary?
That would be a base and there are a lot of ours and how they oppress them there and dacha already wanted to demolish some of them.
Our veterans still remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well, their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, who is so soft, can be peeled like onions and eats their entire EU.
That would be so much fun to jump at the big Russia.
We need to remind them where their place is.
And as detonators, we'll use our comrades who live in their territory.
There are a lot of Russians everywhere, and if they say that they are oppressed there, they are simply oppressed there, and we will not let that happen, we will protect them.
And the Russian will reign again, for what else was he born for?
After all, Europe is only good as a preposition, on which Ivan can dance Cossack.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat over intelligence report
Turkey's foreign minister has summoned the country's top U.S. diplomat to explain a report on U.S. and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish state officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that according to documents provided by a former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major states are watching each other.
An earlier report, according to which German intelligence also targeted Ankara, provoked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones TV Series Announces New Season 4 Tricks
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the cult series.

Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The complainants on Friday presented evidence of extortion from police and municipal officials in the Calvia municipality to the office of the Mallorcan state prosecutor.
The director of police in Calvia, on the holiday island of Mallorca, has been arrested after allegations were made by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Magaluf party district.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after allegations of corruption were made against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday complainants presented evidence of extortion by police and state officials in the municipality of Calvia to the prosecutor of the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Office.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police on charges of corruption and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
Spain’s national newspaper ABC quoted disgruntled owners of nightclubs as saying that favoritism by public officials has had a serious impact on their business.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about survival,” one businessman told the court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after a YouTube video of an 18-year-old British tourist giving oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Since then, island authorities have been trying to keep an eye on drunks and rioters in the ranks attending holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours to bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the oral sex event took place, was forced to close for a year and together with the organizers of the Carnage Bar Tour to pay a fine of 55,000 euros (73,000 dollars).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many drunken accidents, including a fashionable wave known as "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by rain and thunderstorms, which had an impact on the flight at the airport in Adelaide
SPRING brought an icy surprise to the south of South Australia, with heavy rain and strong winds seriously hitting Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is expected to fall in the city until 9 p.m. and another 6.6 mm will fall on Sundays during the night.
The last rain was introduced along with a few short showers associated with the storm and gusts of wind, which began before 8 p.m. and within about ten minutes brought almost 4 mm of precipitation.
After several early doses of spring arrived after winter last week, temperatures in the city dropped again to just 15.8 °C on Monday.
Stormy weather is believed to have contributed to Virgin Airlines' delayed arrival from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide airport at that time reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop from the second landing and eventually boarded at about 8:40 p.m.
The flight was delayed by other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
Temperatures in Adelaide are forecast to reach a maximum of 16°C on Tuesday, and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. However, schools in Gaza remain closed as the territory recovers from the fighting.
The beginning of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in the south of Israel marked by the attacks, but signs of fighting are still evident.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the staff of a nursery school hit by a rocket removed the remains of fragments from the wall and slowly expect the return of the children.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re looking forward to it,” said Ronit Bart, a kibbutz Saad resident and English teacher at a local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that “it’s a bit strange” to go to school all of a sudden.
“We’ve had some tough times and we haven’t left the house at all,” she said.
Kibbutz, located near the Gaza border, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until the end of the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad stayed inside their homes or left their homes and headed to safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a village near the Gaza border in which a Palestinian mortar shot killed a four-year-old boy, hesitate to return.
The education minister said about 12 families had still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that was hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, adding: “We will provide you with education and safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite peace on Tuesday.
While the cease-fire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not resolve key issues such as Hamas' demand for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians have died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures, estimating that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians were killed on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other militants from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country, during the fighting.
The Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken shelter in hundreds of UN schools that have turned into makeshift shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding and the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope they will open the school soon so that we can complete our education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza’s largest city.
I stand by my willow.
And Lafata is troubled by the temperature
The Czech national football team met in Prague before noon today before Wednesday's preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualification against the Netherlands.
Of the 23-member squad, Spartan striker David Lafata, who suffers from temperature problems, is in trouble.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players and David still has a bit of problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"Whether it will be two or three days, or he will be fit tomorrow, will be determined by his state of health, which will be decided by our doctor."
The other players are okay.
"Obviously someone has some painkillers, but it's not like they can't train or participate in the game on Wednesday with the USA," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called in Lukáš Vácha as the last player of the Spartan midfielder.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, other midfielders were also considered.
I decided based on the fact that Lukas is a promising player who is 25 years old.
It was a difficult decision to make, but I stand by it," Vrba said to Vácha.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens with Latata
It is not excluded that in case of health problems, the nomination could still be changed.
On the weekend with a great performance flashed for example Liberec Josef Šural, who gave a hat trick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
We’ll see how David Lafata does.
If he can’t be available on Wednesday, I’m not saying that I can’t nominate any of the players who have taken an interest in the Czech league,” Vrba said.
This afternoon, the national team will have a training session at Strahov, and on Tuesday, a classic pre-match training session before a duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and followed by a signing session.
The U.S. game starts Wednesday at 8:15 p.m. and the national team will fight for their first victory under Vrba.
In the last three games, he has won two games and lost once.
Qualifying matches with the Netherlands are scheduled for September 9 at 20:45.
Walk to the Netherlands in Italy
Vrba is glad that he has more time for training than in previous meetings.
It’s an advantage when you have eight days of players and you can practice certain things with them that maybe we didn’t have so much time for before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing for the Netherlands in the best possible way," Vrba praised.
The Dutch will present themselves in Italy before the match in Prague on Thursday and the duel will be personally watched by former interim national team coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us information about the match.
But it’s not just about him, we’ll have the game and we’ll discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there will be," Vrba said to the bronze medallists from the recent world championship.
According to highly monitored statistics, the prices of apartments in the winter period have increased the most in the last seven years.
According to the Index of Housing Values in the Australian capital, RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase for the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase climbed to 10.9%, more than double in one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Data’s Director of Research Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
RP Data figures show that apartment prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose by 11.7%.
Other strong markets included Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, with price increases averaging between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra was hurt by state-mandated spending cuts and where prices rose by only 1.4% over the year.
Lawless said that with spring now beginning, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the persistently high auction clearance rates, generally high sales speeds and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase even more over the next three months,” he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said, “I love you.”
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in the factory, they had a cooler relationship.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melody is optimistic.
Henry, however, had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry has undergone "thorough" therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You've never seen his face, you've just heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton -- when I was a kid, they were grown-ups -- would go to a bar with him and discuss things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket punch.
I never talked to him like that.
For most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading a newspaper.
Henry had recently visited a foundry in Dudley, and though the conditions were better than his father’s, he saw what life must have been like for him.
There's a little bit more light now, but it's still a dark, smoky, bleak labyrinth where the flames are exploding and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always got in the tub and just lay there, then you could hear him slowly starting to sing to himself because he was washing the foundry off of himself.
As I passed by, I realized that he had been doing this for years to feed his family, and I began to respect him more.
Henry had a childhood without his parents.
Dad didn't hug anyone, didn't say "I love you."
It wasn't until my mom was sick and dying that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying “I love you” now?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
He and French, whom he had been married to for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn's a good girl.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes were starting to show, the doctor said, “You have to make a radical change.”
So I started going to a big fitness center and also had to stick to a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat carrots alone.
The change in direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-haired beard.
After receiving critical acclaim for his Othello, he immersed himself in the theatre.
A Comedy of Errors and Fences by August Wilson followed.
It’s a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed him on stage parodying someone and wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "I was the only black impersonator/comic on television for a long time."
He was learning on the fly.
In addition to being noticed by the public, between 1975 and 1985 I also had to learn how to make jokes, be a star and perform on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Because his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry ended up performing in it with his comedy for five years.
My family was already upset about it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and awkward position, I was working on big scenes and learning how to work with the crowd.
What has been “the main product of British television for years and years” has also been “a grotesque parody of black people.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who both ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
For the next decade, he took on commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and roles in movies, but after his series LennyHenry.tv aired on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Len, because it kind of looks like you're stuck in one place, or a little out of the way."
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was very allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't learn it properly in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was scared.
Everyone we interviewed, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave twenty lines from Othello's closing remarks for the documentary, and he was already in on it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
As if that gave me courage.
"That's what it's about. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out something about it.
So the rehearsing was tough, and before that, I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which didn’t happen.
He soon began acting in Comedy Full of Errors.
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for entertaining the audience.
“The voice in my head said, ‘Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes.’ ”
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can figure it out for me.
“You’re playing, so stay in the role.”
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the Fences was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, adds determination.
The game has also been well received, so it’s like God’s sign saying, “This is what you should do.”
Of course, he says it in an audible voice.
So that's where I'm staying.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
Henry still has the brain of a comedian - he interrupts our conversation with humorous performances, when he enters and exits the role of an imitator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you're always looking for something, you could be at a dead end.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't enjoy it as much as I used to.
I asked him if he'd ever do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps to give outlines of the beginning, middle and end of the journey - I don't think I would ever want to give it up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on non-existent employees
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government payroll.
According to the government, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will stop receiving their paychecks.
The government believes that thousands of people are getting paid even after they have left the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to prevent corruption in the civil service.
An audit this year showed that the state is losing at least $1 million a month in the salaries of non-existent employees and in further abuse of office.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited in bank accounts even after the death of the employee or after the employee leaves the state administration, said the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri, a reporter from Nairobi's capital.
All state officials must report to identification centers within the next two weeks to have their data biometrically recorded, the government said in a statement.
He also says that anyone who doesn't show up without a sufficient apology will be taken off the payroll.
“By identifying real public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economy and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Department of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for ‘conspiracy’ against government
Local media reports that a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government.”
The police office has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 high-ranking officials were among the detainees.
Some of them were involved in a December corruption investigation that targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then prime minister) called their actions part of the actions of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine have returned to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
He told reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools hold traditional ceremonies on September 1st.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
Traditionally, the first day of school is celebrated so that children put on embroidered shirts, bring balloons and give flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for hard times
It carries with it clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience in the front lines.
She started her career at the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the media world of Pearsons.
She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years, and resigned when her junior colleague filled the senior position at Pearson's parent company.
It is said that her severance package was approaching a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, a former director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise at Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's work as a chalice with poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and intricate entity at the centre of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Corporations are turning in two directions: inward to the top of the hierarchy of their own leadership, but also outward to the public voice in times of unrest when things don’t work out.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for thorough reform.
But what director would risk coming to a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, disintegrating it and thus depriving himself of his job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it weren’t so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and how its status is being revised.
As competition expands and new technology challenges old certainties, the immediate negotiation of licence fees for the BBC carries great dangers.
For a modest 145.50 pounds a year, the British public is buying a stake in what is surely the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it produces 96% of households, each at a cost of just 40p a day.
Moreover, the popularity of the BBC is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters, compared to 31% a decade ago.
The models of using BBC services have changed: Today, the headlines show up on my mobile phone, and I can watch the shows I missed on iPlayer.
But the BBC continues to be a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Gov. Perry says he didn't approve the tweet
A tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry's official Twitter account, published Sunday, featured an offensive image of a Democratic prosecutor initiating criminal charges against Perry for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, and another one was posted to Perry's account, distancing itself from the previous one.
A tweet has left my account that was not authorized.
"I don't agree with the tweet and I retracted it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't respond to questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published an unflattering, humorous picture of Travis County prosecutor Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry denied disbursements for her office, bringing Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 election, to the grand jury in Austin this month.
The caption read: “I don’t always drive with three times the permitted blood alcohol level... but if I do, I’ll sue Governor Perry for holding me accountable.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the allegations a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because using the laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry cut off $7.5 million in payments from the state's public interest advocacy department, which is headquartered in Travis County and prosecuting corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection prompted a formal complaint from a left-wing group of civic activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth on his party's committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might be finished by tweeting a photo of himself running near a lake and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says housing market 'returns to normal'
One of London’s most prominent property developers has warned that the housing market has “returned” to normal levels of activity in south-east England.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespread fears of a credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to impose mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from a peak in 2013.” He adds that this provides a “stable environment for operations.”
The London housing market did well during the downturn, as foreign buyers flooded into the capital.
According to data from the cadastral office, prices in the city jumped 18.5% last year, far ahead of the average of 6.7% in England and Wales.
Average retail prices for private, affordable, and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year, rising to ?423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening pound has made it less attractive to foreign buyers of London property in recent months - some of whom have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "settlement tax" introduced by politicians ahead of next May's parliamentary elections.
London real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that the April review of the mortgage market, which introduced tighter lending rules, would also slow the market's growth rate in both real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages for the month of July, indicating that the housing market is calming.
Hamptons International, another real estate firm, cut its forecast for London property prices to 3% in 2015.
Meanwhile, transactions in London’s most expensive neighborhoods, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, have declined by a quarter each year, according to real estate firm WA Ellis.
Still, demand for housing in the capital was a boon for Berkeley, as it raised cash for forward sales to over 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: “Demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location remained the same, and as a result, forward sales have maintained.”
In June, the firm reported that it had sold 3,742 properties between the start of the year and the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the 2007 crisis.
The annual profit before tax increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, revenues by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday, ahead of Pidgley's annual meeting, he said that Berkeley's annual revenue is forecast to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be 450 million pounds.
Shares of Berkeley have come to a standstill on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at 23.96 pounds.
Hacker posts naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence's photos leaked online after a hacker claimed he had a "list" of photos of hundreds of other aspiring actresses.
A spokesperson for the star of “Hunger Games” confirmed that Lawrence’s photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for “apparent privacy violations.”
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos.
The photos, which were originally posted on 4chan's image-sharing server, were allegedly obtained through a loophole in Apple's iCloud internet storage system. The alleged list of photos hacked by victims, according to BuzzFeed, includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It’s unclear how many photos are authentic, but the star of “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” also criticized the act on Twitter.
“I hope those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of your home are happy with yourselves,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the Nickolodeon cable TV series "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied the photos were genuine, saying on Twitter: "These alleged nude photos of me are SUBSCRIPTION, people."
It's better to stop it in the bud. *intentional pun*.
Buzzfeed reported on Sunday night that Ariana Grande's spokesperson denied the alleged photos were genuine.
An extraordinary excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, they gradually decomposed like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, complicated, sharp, isolated, and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it indignantly.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of his ability was an incipient love affair that more than usual promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and a flighty heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
To the south she came with an older companion, whom Kever believed to be her aunt, who had inherited property in a damp but beautiful valley called, aptly, Paradise Valley.
No one has lived in the house for years.
Pipes leaked, spiders were dead in the tubs, slugs signed on the windows as if they thought they owned the place, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge cabbage cones.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Aiinn sat on sofa chairs in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absent-mindedly tuning in to the public station that supplied the region with comforting music and comforting news, as the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of the old song of a long-forgotten black comedian whom he liked to listen to.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, such songs were no longer played on the radio.
They weren't banned--actually nothing was banned--they just weren't playing.
They helped them get into desuetudo, just like the word desuetudo itself.
Folk taste has done what regulations and outlaws could never do, and just as people choose memoirs in which the poor man becomes rich, cookbooks and romance novels, so in music ballads are chosen.
Cavern let himself be dragged down and began to play the imaginary piano, singing the serenade to Ailla's big feet in a rough, comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song from jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he tried to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he was playing with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of the j-word, it cost you a penny.
It wasn’t funny then and it wasn’t funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Aininn's never heard one.
Even jazz, although not directly outlawed, did not play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only room in life for one “if.”
When the melodies started, people wanted to know exactly where they were going to end up.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was the humor expressed in the song.
Although he had not heard of Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten years old, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn’t remember a time when her favorite singers weren’t black.
Also without laws or coercion.
A free society is one in which every part of it, with gratitude -- with the gratitude of those who have been fortunate to be spared -- agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitution suited for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if naturally gifted in electronics, took responsibility for ensuring that no family would be without a working phone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed washed the dishes.
Those in the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED - they were afraid that they would be blamed for putting them on fire, they were actually afraid that the fire would consume them next time - they opened restaurants selling labneh and smoking hookahs, they did not notice themselves, and inaction was slowly eating them.
To each according to his talent.
Since she only listened to ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how the dirty words Kavern had just sung to her could make music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really rude," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people with big feet.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
Not a word could escape from behind the sound-proof leaves.
Ailinn did not understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
“It was funny,” he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief and overshadowed Kevern’s view.
There was nothing in the whole wide world to see but a tangle of her raven hair.
That's all he wanted to see.
“If you say so,” she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Are my legs too big?
He looked again.
Not exactly feet.
Maybe a little ankle...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you" to her, but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are attracting me right now," he tried.
I'm kind of creepy.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic needed to tame the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel to the Cavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from the couch, dropped the radio, and spilled the unfinished wine.
Wine, so it wasn't the drink.
She seemed to be shaking in her agitation like palm leaves in a storm.
“I’m attracted to you for being an idiot,” she said.
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear she had in her eyes the moment she confronted him.
Did she think she'd get hit?
She didn’t talk to him about living on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he had no doubt that the basics there were the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean was rubbing against them.
The same deranged men, then WHAT HAPPENED, even more sullen and sullen than their forefathers, smugglers and spoilers, wandered angrily from inn to inn, ready to lay hands on any woman who would dare to refuse them or laugh at them.
Jerk?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First to cuddle her - cuddle became the most common term for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: an antidote to the faint ballads of love that the radio spewed - first to cuddle her, then to hit her one.
In Kevern's view, over-cultivation because cuddling was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons indicated to him nonverbally that he should leave.
He stood up like an old man.
She was alone, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched as he left - as if watching him from the upstairs window - the man whom he had caught up to what he had done himself.
Adam was leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart clenched for him and for all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, shoulders drooping, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did it seem to her that she knew this look well, even though she could not recall a single moment until today that she had ever seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her feet.
Some twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working at Ofnow, a non-statutory public-mood monitoring system, has prepared a short article on the persistence of mild and moderate acts of violence in areas of the country where its mitigation or even cessation was most expected if enough money and energy were spent to eliminate it.
“Much has been done, and much remains to be done,” she wrote, “to appease the innate aggressiveness of the people who have fought many battles and won most of them, especially in the dreary, hard-to-reach places of the earth, where, despite the tips of the church towers rising above the hedges, a touch of human kindness has historically rarely appeared.”
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It would seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devour unhappy stories, and claim to firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only does old brutality hold as stubbornly in rural areas as it does in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that new and aggressive intolerances are emerging at home, in the workplace, on the roads, and even on sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you have a tendency to be too flowery," said her supervisor.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer that,” said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you gay?
Esme has again defended her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
“I’m not asking,” Rabinowitz finally said, “that I have anything against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
We don't have prejudice in this workplace.
We serve unprejudiced companies.
But a certain kind of oversensitivity, which in itself is perfectly acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort judgment as you have demonstrated it.
Obviously, you yourself are biased toward the Church - things that you call “cruel” and “brutal” could also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural strength and energy.
Still deal with WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened, yesterday, preparing the country with its essential life force.
As Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the light board flashed pink recommendations that Ofnow has been broadcasting to the world for the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, chat, explain, make a deal, apologize.
“Speaking is better than being silent; a sung word is better than writing, but there is nothing better than love.”
“I totally understand your reservations,” said Esme Nussbaum quietly, when she was sure that her supervisor had finished, “and I’m not saying that the wound didn’t heal the way we think it did.
My main concern is that if we do not bring this to our attention in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined his fingertips.
This meant endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “when you describe the steps your grandparents may or may not have taken as mistakes.
You also go too far in talking about venting your “anger” and “distrust” of “others.”
I shouldn’t remind anyone in your position that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we’re not talking about “us” and “them.”
There was no "we" and there was no "they."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
“During which, if we are honest with each other,” Esme took courage, “no one is without guilt.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on that.
And just as there is no guilt to be blamed on someone, there are no things to be corrected, even if the remedy were appropriate and possible.
But what good is the past but to learn from it?
The past exists to be forgotten.
If there's anything I can add to that--
Luther Rabinowitz untied his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into account," he said, releasing her.
The day after, when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hit the sidewalk in a way that passers-by described as “brutal and furious.”
Coincidences happen.
Kingdom of Lesotho army says no coup planned - prime minister stays in South Africa
Military officers of the Kingdom of Lesotho denied that they had orchestrated a coup to overthrow the government, claiming that they had acted against police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the military had surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
After he declared that he was being threatened with death, the prime minister left with his family for neighboring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not really a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
“This morning, the command of the defense forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there are several groups among the police planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to wreak havoc in the country,” he told Voice of America.
Clayson Monyela, a spokesman for the South African government, said the military actions appeared to be an attempt to overthrow the government.
“Although no one has claimed to have seized power by force, the actions of the Lesotho defense forces appear to bear the hallmarks of a coup d’etat,” he said.
Military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho said soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and there was calm in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believed he was under attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
There has been tension in Lesotho since Thabane suspended parliament in June over internal disputes.
He said that despite claims to the contrary, his actions did not undermine the government.
Production in the euro area is at a 13-month low.
Production growth slowed to a 13-month low in the euro area in August, according to a closely monitored survey.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have been cut and factories have been damaged by rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the eurozone and the threat of deflation, with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
Speculation has surfaced that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have hinted this week that he is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone, similar to what the UK and US did during the financial crisis.
“Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the drag the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty has on manufacturers is becoming more visible,” said Rob Dobson, Markit’s chief economist.
Germany’s manufacturing PMI, Russia’s biggest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone's second largest economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
"Signs that the drivers of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands have disappeared are also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The industry slowdown is likely to add fuel to analysts’ expectations of implementing additional monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said, “The best that can be said about the purchasing managers’ production review for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Eurozone producers are currently having a very difficult life because the increasing geopolitical tensions, especially between Russia and Ukraine, are adding even more uncertainty to the still challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has demonstrably affected trade - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially costly ones.
He said it appeared “even more likely” that the ECB would eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten Years of Hell for Beslan Survivors: Ten Years of Horror from Occupied School Children Still Suffer
Ten years ago, thousands of people were held hostage at a Chechen school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the three-day ordeal that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocity at the school
Exactly 10 years after the horrifying seizure of a school in Beslan that killed 334 people, including 186 children, the surviving heroes warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it seemed like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy brought East and West together, leading to action and a future in this disastrous disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocity at the school.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted misfortune, even though the memory of the hell caused by terrorists will live on in them.
What is their biggest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - may be over.
A girl trying to climb back into a ruined school gym
It was captured by top Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov trying to climb back into a bombed-out school gym in his underwear only after a bomb exploded in it.
Confused, Aida desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
It was feared that they were both dead, but in fact survived.
“A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
She was saved by a soldier.
After several operations, she thought she had recovered fully, but yesterday she said, “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another operation.
There were pieces of shrapnel in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people the way doctors have helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn’t destroy it,” she said with determination.
“It just happened to me, and it can’t be changed.
Once a year I go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with friends.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate, Djera Gapoeva, was killed there.
When we were kids, we would play together and imagine going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten the captivity, but the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened and we are so grateful for the help we have received from the UK and other countries.
When I look at a picture of myself climbing through a school window on the Internet, I think a lot of people are going to see it for the first time, understand the disaster, and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped from the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children school begin at the age of seven) and he survived a three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, “My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Run."
Fearing she was dead, he ran and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbing the child's hand and running away with a shower of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother is dead."
He said, “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara stumbled into freedom and was lying in the hospital with an injured leg, thinking that her son had died.
After they met again, she said, “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World), where he was declared the winner by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie Bernardo's Children.
“The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it,” he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that the memories are fading.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But I can play computer games these days, and I don't have a problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who didn't get out.
We will never say that they were killed or that they died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy store, and how I drove a convertible.
But now he worries about places like Ukraine, where he suffers because of the war, just as he and his friends suffered.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
“I feel terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such horrors,” says Damir, who took part in a volunteer activity at the monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
One day I want to work for the police and I hope to be admitted to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no children screaming and running around, and the silence lasted for months.
He vividly remembers the trip with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember when Damir had a taste for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, and Damir was shooting at them with a water pistol, and they were running off and playing with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised at how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still don’t think the world has changed for the better in 10 years.
Now the war is in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been and will be killed.
They are the same children as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they're bored or doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown up to be a nice and quiet boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to think about it, but he's very close to six of his classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he had trouble with it - I remember sometimes he would lie on the couch with his face away from us and sometimes he would lie there for hours.
He wasn't asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember that he threw out all his guns or other weapons to play with.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember shouting ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced he hadn’t heard me.
But he heard her and ran away.
Our lives go on unlike any other.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose picture was taken after the attack became a symbol of horrors in Beslan
Consolation: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Grigory today
As he fled for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was etched in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the Beslan atrocity.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and hurried to take his older son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists invaded the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days,” she recalled.
Not quite alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it becomes harder to think about and talk about.
Not a day goes by that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn’t feel like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still-recurring memories: Grigory's photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There is even a statue of Grigory crying in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like to look at that picture, and we keep it in the library at home.
I get it, but I also think that's how people around the world know how much pain we're feeling.
Today Grigory says: “The important thing is that this does not happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever know the truth.
Now they're investigating the boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
This world is expecting something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for this kind of pain.
To forget a little bit, it takes decades.
It affected my health, I can still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
When I went back to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why, when September 1st comes around, I go to the gym.
I want to honor my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is in the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived while being held at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregori Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, yet he managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in a gymnasium sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It feels like it was yesterday," said Gregorij, who wanted to become an agent for the Federal Security Service but could not because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've put behind me.
I'm older now, and they say kids can handle bad experiences better - I have to say that's not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - this was the first and last time I re-entered the gym.
I fainted.
I will never go there again, and please don’t ask me to show you where I am sitting in that well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregori Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in hospital after the attack
The pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don’t like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
When it comes to physical health, I’m fine.
I have to be careful of my knee that I hurt, but I'm walking normally now.
But still, due to my health, I couldn’t start and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that it was not possible.
My other hobby is animals, so I went to the vet.
I finished the second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from “cats to cows.”
He said: “I know I’ll never tell my kids about it.
It’s not something that children should know about, and certainly not something that they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be there.
He's inside, and he's getting worse with the anniversary coming up.
I will attend the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there, unlike me.
I waited for him at home and couldn’t help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregorij is an adult today, but he carries the horror with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I would say that 50% of the time he has overcome the horror, but it is impossible to overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could have given me, but it hurts me to lose those killed.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now coming to our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we come to fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If only we could take all those rebels and throw them away as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child who was taken to safety by a special commando
Saved: Alyona Tskaeva carries a special commando unit (left) to the safe Russian.
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the tragedy at all
The world gasped in 2004 when a Russian police officer carried little Alyona in his arms from Beslan captivity.
The terrorists released her, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina, and brother Makhar in captivity at the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan has remarried and they have a baby girl named Kristina.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, has no recollection of the attack and has grown into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said: “It’s a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep the children away from the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
Man accused of hitting girl on sign crossing in Fife village
A 78-year-old man is on trial for striking down a three-year-old girl on a sign crossing in the village of Fife.
Gordon Stewart reportedly hit the girl at a crossing at Pittenween in East Neuk.
Prosecutors allege that Stewart did not drive his Audi Q3 with sufficient consideration and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart (78) of Anstruther denied the charges at Dundee court.
Judge Charles Macnair has set a date for the trial to take place in January.
4 Tips on How to Take Better Photos and Videos Underwater
If you are interested in shooting or underwater shooting, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with a couple of cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules for getting the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, adjust the camera based on the type of photos or videos you take.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scene or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to dark underwater environments.
And before you do, find out how deep you can dive with your gear.
Some cameras are designed for up to 5 feet, others for up to 50 to 60 feet.
Read our guide to buying and rating digital cameras in both normal and waterproof design.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't work.
Compact cameras have an LCD to help you compose your photos, but outdoor ones don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, underwater it will be hard to see and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with slightly different exposure dispersion, take advantage of this.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper dip, the light decreases significantly.
If possible, stay close to the water when taking pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
It also allows you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you dive, the less color you'll see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That’s great advice if you’re shooting on land, but underwater is even more important because of the dim light.
This is especially important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill a photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality was able to change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving the pain of illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focused on diagnoses and diseases, the vast majority of patients treated were interested in something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He was struggling with flu symptoms and found himself impatient and involving his wife Juliet with remorse.
He said, “I want everything to happen sooner rather than later.”
When Juliet left on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague gave him a chest X-ray.
Two weeks earlier, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or lining of the lungs.
For most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine the cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is exposure to asbestos - a building fiber material that was previously described as "miraculous" but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not hard to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was in use, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as isolationists, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers.
The toxin used in industry in another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
Such complacency is not appropriate.
As it turns out, there is a mesothelioma epidemic in Britain today.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma is higher than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from the disease each year are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason we are only now feeling its effects, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for the mesothelioma to develop.
The Mesothelioma disaster is not just for construction industry veterans.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we learn in, and the stores we shop in.
Thus, mesothelioma does not respect the social stratum, wealth, occupation, or age.
Privileged bastions from London department stores to public schools do not constitute a refuge.
The world is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even consider isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
“It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years practicing,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, this was a question he was able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who have practiced at Guy's Hospital and who have developed mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a 2010 letter, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis is not so common.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us get sick with the same disease?”
According to a leading British mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is taking place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
In a cursory look at the files from the archives of the courts, to which the victims often turn and demand compensation, it shows how much the Mesothelioma scourge has spread.
Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted this June that it had negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she oversaw the clothing section in two stores - one of the locations was the company's flagship store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
He now has two children who are in their 20s.
“Before it happened,” he says, “I had never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed it would affect me in any way.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
It got its name because of its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Today, chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, can be found in buildings.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even brake linings.
While it is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and WHO consider it a “major health risk” that can cause death.
But more dangerous are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts argue that “there is compelling but circumstantial evidence that this was a major cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK].”
Marsk & Spencer employee exposed to asbestos at Oxford Street flagship store in London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete's work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that "a substantial proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known asbestos exposure at work or at home were probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
Much of this exposure is due to the “normal use and weathering” of buildings.
No one can be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even those in the centre of government may not know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard released a report saying that service elevators and pipes behind parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be broken by something as harmless as a “strong airflow.”
Ministers are often accused of only taking care of their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Parliamentary Services Directorate has insisted that the Palace of Westminster be given a "positive medical certificate", it is now envisaged that one million pounds and several years of work will be needed to thoroughly inspect Parliament, modernise electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 elections, Members of Parliament will be seated in the premises of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
Goddard’s report states that “the presence of asbestos does not comply with several regulations.”
It is impossible to say whether this inconsistency will cost lives.
Now everyone can just wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when they have been exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos was proven to be present,” he says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked, and when he worked there.
However, he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009 when he was hit by something like a chill.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was in the middle of an operation.
Suddenly I trembled.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain came from the pleura, the lining around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
He finally spent a month at home.
Confused doctors gave him a chest X-ray and a chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent for analysis from his lungs.
However, they did not make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came into the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and at work he came into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted a panel of experts on his CT and X-ray scans.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel sick, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the space between the chest lining and the lung lining.
I'm optimistic.
“I tend not to take much,” he says.
To be honest, I wasn't really worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began dating sisters from the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“Asbestos has been shown to be widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to develop the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes were found in hospitals in the basement, so they were unlikely to put patients at risk.
However, staff members who walked through basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (like often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
It now turns out that decades after the war, hospitals were a place where they could have saved patients’ lives, but also a place that could have endangered the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed.
Bunsen burners were built on asbestos pads.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its excellent insulating and non-combustible properties.
In schools as well.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in the countless chemistry classes, students put Bunsen's burner on an asbestos mat.
A website has been created to address the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or the roofs of tool sheds in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, the attorney who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember was in the 1970s when she was demolishing a garden house.
So be careful how you tear down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
“It takes a while for you to figure it out,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but found that I couldn’t concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna live to see another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of doctor to the position of patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand,” he says.
I asked my doctor, “How much time do I have?”
I was told it was 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I’m not going to live to see another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive -- breathing itself -- is what causes cancer to kill.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which, paradoxically, is the leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and has treated other patients who have been exposed to asbestos during their hospital experience.
Asbestos needles get into lung tissue, Treasure says, and “breathing alone pushes them to the edge where the lining is.
Its nature is invasive from the very beginning.
Mesothelioma is not a common treatment option used for other types of cancer.
The effectiveness of the operation, for example, is hotly debated.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “doesn’t respond very well to chemotherapy,” which “has some effect,” but it doesn’t cure.
“Sometimes there’s someone who survives lung cancer,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After discovering mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counselor for equally affected people.
When they called, he said, "Hello, you've reached the cancer center."
“He was very positive,” Abbott said.
He was diagnosed four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and would likely extend his life by only a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson “has been able to show things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the department of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
“I had the advantage of not having to wait to be sent to him, but I just called and they looked at me,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a request and be approved for reimbursement.
In order to get the best treatment available, the question of money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma.
But when treatments inevitably fail, many patients face additional financial worries about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're turning to the courts and asking for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health,” Morgan says.
In the 1960s, however, it was discovered that even very small amounts of it could pose a health risk.
This is where the negligence of companies comes in.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but Morgan said it was not a "full-fledged settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the incriminated basement section was removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
To blame exposure to deadly asbestos on a single company or place of work - usually decades after it happened - has proven to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or gone bankrupt.
Insurance records are lost.
And those who now defend themselves against the charges have time on their side, which their accusers certainly do not.
In response, important new legislation was passed this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients to seek redress even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve that is paid for by insurance companies and intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount they would normally be awarded by the court as compensation - around 120,000 pounds.
300 successful applications are expected every year.
Like patients with mesothelioma, Andrew Morgan believes that the 350 million pounds is “good work”.
“It’s a deal written by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the amount is a quarter of what insurance companies would have had to pay if they hadn’t intervened in time and people with mesothelioma would have been able to catch up with former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, a former Labor and Social Affairs minister, admitted that the law "had loopholes."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, swift action was required.
“People are suffering too much and they need help now,” Penning said last December during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Act.
Graham Abbott was under the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a five-year survival rate in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott got stronger.
“That’s obviously not the most important thing,” Abbott says.
You see it with patients all the time.
There is something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Inspections showed no signs of illness.
I went for another check in March [2014].
I had a few spots [of cancer] in my chest.
I was just approaching my 50th birthday.
It's not life-threatening.
He's off the hook.
Abbott resumed six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no signs of tumors in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about the practical things - the financial security when I die, or to show a woman how the alarm clock works on the boiler.
When you hear bad news, you become negative.
You have to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin's (14), it's not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very sociable and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face such conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not relieved by hope or just a hint of chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brings Stephen Jay Gould) bleak certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life threatening.”

In Italy, asbestos is starting to appear in commercial use, it is used for the production of paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opening in Canada and South Africa, and soon thereafter in America, Italy, and Russia.
During the Industrial Revolution, it is an excellent insulating agent in steam engines and turbines.

They won't pay any settlement.
Ships are being built intensively during World War II, work in shipyards poses the highest risk of exposure to asbestos.
Prohibition of imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful action for personal injury from asbestos exposure in Britain.
Global asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The UK imports 139 000 tonnes.
The UK Institute for Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All types of asbestos are banned in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act comes into force in the UK.
A $350 million compensation program is launched.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos continues to be used as a cheap building material.
World production stands at 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong authority to choose leadership - protesters vow revenge
China's parliament decided on Sunday not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite mounting debates over democratic reform.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district as activists began organizing and preparing just hours after the announcement.
In essence, the Chinese People’s Congress allows Communist leaders to vote out any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t surprise us, but it angered us,” said Democratic Party leader Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
People in Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing public nominations in the elections of the leadership of Hong Kong would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised that from 2017 onwards, residents will be able to vote for the executive branch.
China's leaders have presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to directly vote, but the decision also makes it clear that China's leaders are firmly in control of the process of nominating a committee that is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw some of Hong Kong's biggest and most watched protests in years.
The majority of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong are driven by the Occupy Central movement, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district if Beijing does not grant them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy in the Rain supporters gathered outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that it would begin waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said the movement "considered occupying the Central only as a final step in the event that all possibilities for dialogue were exhausted and there was no other choice left.
We must announce with regret that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days and on Sunday strengthened the protection of the government's headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
The instigation of the riots is a sign that many residents of Hong Kong are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in products and services.
There is also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being undermined by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupy Central movement and say their demonstrations threaten trade - Hong Kong's lifeboat.
“The protest he’s talking about could cause far more economic damage depending on how many people attend and for how long,” said Regina Ip, a politician who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to see widespread concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could damage the investment.
Chinese state media have also come forward in recent days with reports portraying democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights that drew 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
Pre-election campaign?
The league in Jihlava bears the name of the political movement
Approximately 1,600 amateur athletes play football in the regional town of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is now called Together for Jihlava league.
It was named after a movement that is going into the October municipal elections.
Ten on his candidate is also the head of a small football in Jihlava Jan Mraka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem," Mráka said.
The situation around the first league of small football has already been dealt with by lawyers of Jihlava town hall and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
Last year, according to the city website, the small football won about one million crowns.
This year, too, there are hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure of a small football is not contrary to the law or the directives of the municipality.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to amend the rules for the allocation of grants and subsidies," said Radek Tulis, spokesperson for the municipality.
To draw subsidies from the city and at the same time express as a small football support in the elections of one political party, it is probably not possible.
There has not been a similar demand for high-level football from politicians yet.
That the ČSSD regional championship, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1 could be created.
What about classes and competitions?
I wouldn't be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like corporate sponsors to turn to us," said Miroslav Vrzáček, president of the regional football association.
The head of the small football of another party and the movement will not allow the name of the league
According to the players of small football, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six playgrounds, cloakrooms and sanitary facilities.
"For example, the course Na Stoupách is not ours, we are there for rent," said Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be Český mlýn.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a nonsensical area for skateboarders, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava," Mráka said.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small football uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošického and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are going to modernize or build sports facilities at schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think a lot of progress has been made over the last few years,” he added.
Other political parties in the leagues will not appear, according to Jan Mrák.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field enters into the partnership, we don’t put the other there,” he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the town council commission for sport.
"But whether voters evaluate whether Mrák is using the Lesser Town football club Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition permeates university life - freshmen can fly jet planes
We are pleased to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also stated that the service has its own security side.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their belongings across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher) variants this year, students arrive at the university with minimum jitters and maximum luxury.
A spokesperson for the company said that since the services have only just started, they have no reservations yet, but added: "Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks."
The company also stated that although students pay an annual tuition fee of 9,000 pounds, they expect the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and wishes - making the right first impression is more important than ever, and VIF is exactly the right way to do it.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, commented: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students starting university this month have to cope with the financial crisis before throwing away thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to keep up with the rising cost of basic necessities.
Feminists oppose racism and police behaviour after Ferguson events
Earlier this month, an unarmed young man was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
Those waiting for the funeral chant with their hands up: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed young man Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has noted a shift in online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prioritize gender over race.
With rising tensions in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that white women’s reactions were 100% race-focused.
Compared to the reaction of black women soon after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines such as “White women’s thoughts on Ferguson” or “Feminism is not just about oppressing women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this represents an important change.
“I don’t think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at that level,” she said.
People felt they had to speak up about what had happened.
This is characteristic of the crisis we are facing because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially determined that they had to draw attention to it.
According to Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light problems that African-American women face every day that are not perceived as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post funny life stories with my partner on Facebook and it gets 150 likes from people all over the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about the coloreds being trapped in their own country, it's a deafening silence.
“How is it possible for a woman to talk publicly about relationships but not security in a public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with issues of race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
Black women could not afford the luxury of sharing these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women are now merging the question of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was in almost all cases of white rape," said Hattery.
To justify lynching, you needed the cooperation of white women.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when suffrage fighters like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people could have the right to vote - women or blacks.
“They decided to bet on the right to vote for women and to focus on the right to vote for blacks later,” Hattery said.
Realizing this, we get an important insight into why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years before they began organizing against lynching in the Southern Women's Association to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
Mitchell said the reaction of white feminists to the issues raised in Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - reflected a time when white feminists had to "catch up" with the issues faced by black women for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if the activists in these spaces [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?” she asked.
The second wave of feminists, who have made careers by fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception, are now figuring out what that means.
Notable feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took down Michael Brown two weeks after the Facebook attack, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of The Guardian calling for white Americans to protest racism more vigorously.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and opinions about race, which differ significantly in opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on race in America confuse some people.
American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s remarks faced criticism from Ferguson’s party earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program called My Brother’s Keeper to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it sparked angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only issue that has come to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the country's southwest this year, the issue of immigration law reform has once again arisen - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration law reform, said that in order to raise the issue as necessary for women, all she had to do was share stories of immigrant women.
“They speak for themselves,” says Mercado.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position to be vulnerable when it comes to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a resonance in women's organizations," she said.
Residence of a pig in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agency removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it published it, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
A one-room detached house, for sale for ?120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photos included a picture of a living room in which a pig rests with its head on a sofa.
The real estate agency Connells said the pig in the photo is a pet of the owners.
"The photo was taken by mistake and has been removed," a spokesman for the office said.
In information about the property, Connells described the former prayer house as "a single one-room house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey in the southwest has a fresh millionaire
The Harvey lottery player gets a million dollars.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in southeast Perth, with one lucky man taking home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery campaign.
Harvey's fortunes were split for the second time in five years, most recently in November 2009, when it won $1 million.
The lucky winner has yet to register.
Store owner Steve Forward said the entire city in southwest Perth is talking about winning.
It's a major issue, and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was to the touch.
Eight winners split one win in Western Australia last month, capping off several happy weeks.
Last weekend, the player at Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires, and just a few weeks earlier the couple had won a whopping $7.5 million in Belmont.
The winning pair had been betting for 20 years and said the win would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th sole Western Australia lottery winner this year, winning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains will not run tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
In a press statement, the GDL called the protest a warning strike for which it deliberately chose time off-peak.
The selected strike time is taken into account by the GDL for many people who return by rail from the weekend only during the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people commuting for work during the day," the union said in a press statement announcing the strike on Monday morning.
"Our first strike should primarily hit freight traffic, fewer passengers already," the GDL added.
The DB has not yet released its official response to the strike.
It is also unclear how the protest will affect international rail connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a 5% pay increase for train drivers and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
At present, the average salary of train drivers varies between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked.
DB engineers work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept pay increases when working hours are reduced.
At the same time, they stress that the pay of train drivers must develop in the same way as for other railway personnel, for which DB does not expect a reduction in the working week.
Krest's car was about to catch fire.
That's why he finished at the Barum Rally
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so I didn’t think it would happen.
Was it possible to repair the exhaust temporarily and continue at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we headed straight there, yes.
But there were two more stages ahead of us, and we couldn't.
It has a high temperature and the risk of the car starting to burn was great.
I can't afford that.
You have completed five stages at full speed.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, but I didn't go over the wint.
Everything was caused by the fact that we have been pipping the car for more than half a year to keep it at some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You started it so that you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The work didn't go to waste.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought of did not come.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one to drop out of the championship game prematurely.
He also lost foreign favourites Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Are you surprised that so many of your favorites have dropped out?
Yeah.
It was a pity especially for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, for whom you are preparing a car, was also at the top for a long time.
But he paid for the fact that he flew off the track and took almost a two-minute gap.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could have repeated the podium.
I mean, he was going through his first two times.
But even Mira confirmed that we prepared the car well.
He was going really fast.
Exactly a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling of driving make you a regular participant in rally races again?
Certainly not at this point.
I said last year that Barumka was my last race and I still didn’t keep it.
I decided to go with her again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's another chance next year, I think I'll do it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did it please you?
To a certain extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking me if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team goes on.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't do too much damage here.
In addition, he wants to borrow Honza Sýkora from us for this race.
With Mira, we have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We’ll have to prepare things for next year.
Is there anything you can suggest?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsica Rally was part of the World Rally Championship, you reached your maximum in the series in fifth place.
Don’t you want to try the trails again?
He's not.
An oral agreement with the employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not get a certificate of incapacity from your doctor, which serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
The absence was not immediately reported to the employer.
Subsequently, an agreement was reached that the given days would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement was made only orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to confirm the employer’s consent to the use of leave in writing, this procedure has proved effective in practice.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take leave, as in your case, may be denied and absence from work considered as a long-term unexcused absence, thus a reason for immediate termination of employment under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a legal dispute about the agreement with the employer, you lack demonstrable proof.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled under Section 53, you only have the given days listed in the credit sheet as an unexcused absence.
Unexcused absences from the credit card do not have the same consequences as those of Section 53 (e.g. inability to obtain material unemployment insurance), but this makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have a written confirmation that there was an injury that caused you to be incapacitated (this is not a so-called "incapacitated", this is only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can submit the mentioned document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, and the early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to take leave.
You will avoid possible complications.
Tony Stewart's return to the track
Returning to the track ended for Tony Stewart just outside half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the fence for the second time after his right front tyre burst in lap 172, and the race ended for him.
Stewart drove the damaged car to the garage, didn't comment to reporters, and left.
His team boss Chad Johnston said the No. 14 car team is disappointed but will now focus on the Richmond, Virginia race, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have a better performance and a better finish," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope for more.
Stewart hit the fence for the first time in a Sunday night race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required a right-side repair of his car.
“We were hoping for a good finish in today’s race,” Johnston said, adding: “It just didn’t work out.”
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to go.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York City, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and needed to win either the Atlanta race or the following Richmond race to catch up with the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into the tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who ran into Stewart during the race.
Authorities said it would take at least another two weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion was warmly encouraged before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, working his way up to 10th and then even to 4th at the start of the race.
Then, at the beginning of lap 122, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, exited the second corner and hit Stewart, sending both cars into the barrier.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague selects new taxi operator to earn $12.3 million
Prague has completed the tender for a new manager of taxi stations.
For 103 parking spaces, it will gain about CZK 12.3 million per year.
Until recently, the same places for taxi drivers collected 150 thousand crowns a year.
This was reported by councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used lotteries when selecting administrators.
The winner then received a rental for a lump sum of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer currently decides.
"A year after the termination of the original lease agreements and the launch of the selection procedures, the new lease system proved to be much more advantageous and fairer overall for Prague," the councilor said.
The most expensive spot is Na Perštýně
The highest price was offered by those interested in a station in Na Perštýně street.
They pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
The new administrators paid approximately CZK 1.5 million for seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for renting taxi stations were adopted by councillors in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year they terminated the original lease agreements.
The selection procedures took place in four waves and the new administrator found 29 posts.
This is the second time we have had to clean the well this year.
We drained it every time, creating practically a second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured in Savo.
An incredible smell!
Our well in the cellar always provided plenty of wonderful fragrant water.
And it wasn't done professionally, Grandpa dug it out with his own help.
A long time ago.
It was just three circles and overall peculiar, like everything else in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, the water didn’t seem to smell.
We were wondering if something fell in there.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a bit of bad luck, there the board did not quite fall, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we shone it through to the bottom.
So we let her out and cleaned her up again.
Of course, we improved the improvised gasket around the pump pipe.
We noticed some strange things in the basement.
There was a box of bricks on the floor.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further on.
Now it looked like a drooling mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where there are vents, Grandpa's invention, there were remnants of a fish!
And hard to ride!
Our basement is special, too.
Some would say that Grandpa just dug up the cabin.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just sand, only the ceiling is hollow.
They mainly ship there.
And wheels.
And sun loungers on the beach.
The doors with wide gaps were mostly open, as someone was walking there all the time.
At the ceiling a few already mentioned vents.
No net, so it's common for birds to fly there and build nests on the rafters.
There is no point in talking about mice.
Grandpa wanted it to work, and he did.
But even Luft didn't help.
The whole basement smelled.
We also cleaned the entire store.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw away things that were around: planks, a heraclite board, and so on.
Our cottage remotely welcomed passers-by with disinfectant odor.
We've been wondering, who could have dragged those disgusting scraps in there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It's hard for her to come here for a snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not all right.
Didn't he put a vent in the Frenchman's filth?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, that's what he has.
We decided to guard the cellar and the well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, only for washing and washing until the tests were done, but it was already good.
Pulling water out of a forest well is not something I want to do for a long time.
One day, we heard the horribly anxious barking of our bitch.
Mom looked down from the balcony and saw a long thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Reza was jumping over her and squealing like crazy.
Mom scolded her because she thought Reza had dug up a waste hose from the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose partially tangled into the ball and partially straightened.
There was hissing on the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical seizure.
We ran down.
The toad, over a meter long and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a giant toad, and Reza was preventing it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the snake saw the superiority in the form of our whole family, she probably told herself to eat it, when we are so hungry, and elegantly stretched through the vent into the cellar.
We went to see her.
Like lightning, she jumped behind a well.
By the way, we noticed another smelly package on her record.
It smells like a fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit shady.
We closed the store during the day.
That he would...
We went out, and there we all lay down to one vent.
We didn't wait long.
It's all over the well.
First, a flat head appeared with yellow marigolds on its neck.
Then the whole thing hit the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to dig in.
The fired employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company and sold them
A disgruntled employee bought computers for the company and then sold them.
He managed to spend the money before being arrested by the police.
In a short period of time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers in twelve cases for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After the takeover, he took the notebooks to Olomouc, where he sold them in bazaars," said Rostislav Br?ckner, the chief commissioner of the Šumperk police.
The motive of the fraud was revenge to the employer for the dismissal and also to make money.
"He told us during the interrogation that he had used the money to pay off the loans," said Brueckner.
Police also found that the impostor was a pathological gambler who had been repeatedly treated in a psychiatric ward.
The money could also end up in slot machines or in video lottery terminals.
"The fact is that we didn't find any money on him," the commissioner said.
The fraudster, who has already been convicted of theft, now faces between one and five years in prison.
Police have not yet said whether they are also threatening to punish the bazaars that bought the notebooks under price and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they were taking over completely new goods, which is suspicious at best," the commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have yet been charged.
Come a little further, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have made a few changes.
The biggest change was the change of route, which brought the destination to the embankment, instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we took pictures and filmed videos together.
To perfect my view from the other side, I accepted the role of a personal conductor.
My friend Katya and I obediently lined up at the end of the corridor 60 to 70 minutes before the start.
We greeted our friends who walked past us to the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A few minions to warm up, turn on the sport testers, countdown and start!
Screams of cheer, but instead of a quick start followed stomping to the starting line.
After five minutes we reach the gate, turn on the measurement and start at the pace of ten o'clock.
We are intertwined with a yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far they all look fresh, slowly falling sun in the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad almost cheesy tinge.
The pulsating mass stretching along the waterfront looks as if the whole of Prague is running here.
On the embankment between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally starting to show who has how many powers.
The light hill at Palacký Square forces many runners to slow down or walk.
Just before the run to the Theatre I see a police escort and right behind him Vítek Pavlišta flies at an incredible pace to the finish.
I can hear the admiring sighs of the other runners.
I'm moving to the edge of the track, encouraging him, he's about to slap me, but just before that, my leg gets sprained and our hands just miss.
Running down Theatre Street gives a chance for a short rest and refreshment.
There are places in front of us where the views take my breath away.
The turn on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing and my legs are almost on their own.
After the first refreshment comes the moment of truth.
When crossing the road, Katya stumbles against the curb and makes a swim jump.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm running a series of pep talk so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and we continue down the Goat Lane, it is one of the narrowest points of the track, at this stage of the race there is not so much rush, but still it is necessary to monitor the surroundings well.
I do not know yet that the concept of the narrowest place will acquire its true meaning later.
Behind the Powder Tower we are frantically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to clap my hands with everyone who offers a hand, and I also advise Katya, because ten claps with fans is like half an energy bar.
It's really working, we're accelerating again, and even though we've fallen through a lot, now the pursuit has begun.
We overtake dozens of runners when I pass someone particularly tired, I try to cheer him up with a few words: "Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it!"
After the last snack, no one beats us, we're accelerating.
So far we have run for an hour and a quarter, we are adding, there is nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish will hurt, but you really need to work hard.
The sun has already slowly set and the end of the day symbolically closes the race.
Last run to the bridge, turn and now just straight to the finish.
The pace we're running at makes me wonder, where does this girl come from?
"Come on, we're going under 13 o'clock, we're working!"
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target.
An hour, thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can you do?
Coach set a limit of 20 hours.
Seven minutes to plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the target, Katya's legs are bending, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-done performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the target area.
Euphoria does not make us think of the crowding in the passageways to the changing rooms.
Here you can see that the Goat Lane was not the narrowest place.
This is all the way to the end of the embankment, which is under the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners crammed to burst.
If you don’t like crowds, this is not the place for you.
Even after a while I lose my head and wonder if the beautiful views and compared to the previous years more interesting route was worth what is happening at the finish.
I know from personal experience that running a race is no fun.
If you add ten thousand people, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere of the Žluté lázně was also transferred to the runners in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random spectators stepped it up on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, there are obstacles that cannot be removed when running through the historic city centre, but I do not consider the goal of the mass race to be the best solution in a place that is bordered on one side by a wall and on the other by a river.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I consider it very good.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Tell us in the discussion if you liked the route and what you think about the situation at the finish.
Prison Guards Organize Protests in Bulgaria
Hundreds of employees of the prison service throughout Bulgaria participated in a nationwide protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
On the list of demands to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov are also higher salaries.
Peacekeepers for a month symbolically protested the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the prison guards' union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
“Negotiations are still ongoing,” Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of the Prison Service, told BNR.
Members of the Federation of Workers' Trade Unions in the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of prison service employees.
Why the Universe May Have Multiple Dimensions and We Can't See Them
Physicists don't usually write best-sellers, but Brian Greene of Columbia University hit it off in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the thicket of problems that many theoretical physicists deal with today - the attempt to unify two great but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
Undoubtedly, one of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the basic problem between two key theories (because our universe is currently de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and solve it so imaginatively that it is worth retelling even to laymen.
In addition, Greene dealt with the complex material so freshly and engagingly that he can not be blamed for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he has largely corrected his "mistake" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and The Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book becoming obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a little more lively in this area (perhaps due to the fact that the LHC accelerator will finally run on "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter the Greene non-violently open doors of the world of modern physics.
How big can our universe be?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound foolish, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and perfectly acceptable.
To understand this, let’s turn our eyes from the universe as a whole for a moment to something more grounded, namely a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine stretching a 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scene from half a kilometer away (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily detect a long, horizontally stretched hose, but if you are not suffering from acuity, you will hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which to walk: a left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at a given moment, you only answer with one piece of information: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we're saying is that from a mile away, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping the hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "clockwise/counterclockwise direction", that is, around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant, you need to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle wrapping the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note that experts note that this chapter focuses purely on the fault theory of strings.
Non-disruptive aspects are discussed in chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked by a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size along the hose is long and easy to see.
The dimensions surrounding the hose circumference are short, "wound" and less noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
That they split into two groups.
They can be either large, large and therefore directly visible, or, conversely, small, coiled and much harder to observe.
Of course, in this case, we did not work hard to reveal the "wound" dimension surrounding the thickness of the hose.
All you had to do was get a pair of binoculars to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - the coiled dimension would only be revealed with great effort.
Kaluza sent Einstein an article in 1919 in which he came up with the astonishing idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions.
Kaluza argued that the extra dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises of how this observation of Kaluza goes together with the obvious fact that we see precisely the three dimensions of space.
The answer Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines, and clearly stated and specified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands or falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that, like dimensions in the direction of hose length, our universe also has large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of every moment.
But, by analogy with the circular circumference of a garden hose, the universe may also have additional dimensions, tightly coiled into a space so tiny that it has so far remained hidden from our most sophisticated experimental apparatuses.
To get a clearer idea of the nature of Kaluza’s remarkable design, let’s stick to the hose for a moment.
Imagine that on the perimeter of the hose we draw a rather dense row of circles in black.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
Thanks to the drawing, we will now discover the coiled dimension even more easily, as we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited, and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, note the illustration in Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space, just as we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are coiled into a small enough space; this explains that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square mesh shows the commonly known "big" dimensions, while the circle shows the new, tiny and coiled dimension.
Just like loops of threads in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - we just drew them only into the intersections in the square mesh.
The background of Figure 4 depicts the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - on such common scales as meters, represented by the side of a small square in a square net.
In each image below, we focus on a small area of the image preceding it; we enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see on the first few levels of magnification.
However, if we go further in our search for the microscopic properties of space geometry - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, coiled dimension in the shape of a circle, similar to the loops of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions, much like a hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have drawn the circular dimension only in some regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluza and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity to the hose is obvious, although we note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have only drawn two), whereas the hose has a large dimension of only one.
The even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly coiled dimension is extremely miniature, it is much more difficult to recognize it - like the circular circumference of the hose - than to observe the apparent, large and expansive dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimension is small enough, it will actually be revealed beyond the power of our state-of-the-art enlarging tools.
But most importantly, the extra dimension is not just a round bump inside the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point of three common expansive dimensions.
It is a dimension on the other three dimensions independent as well as being top-down, left-right and front-to-back independent of each other (and perpendicular to each other).
A small enough ant could move in all four dimensions, and we would need four figures to determine its position, in addition to the three usual round-dimensional position; if we count time, then five figures, in any case one more than we would normally expect.
Are you interested?
Brian Greeen’s book The Elegant Universe can be found here.
The price for the e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, we find that even though we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluza and Klein’s reasoning shows that this does not preclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize the structures of a large billionth of a billionth of a meter.
Smaller coiled dimensions can hardly be observed.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluza's original idea with several ideas from the emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension could be about one Planck length, a size far beyond the resolution of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluza-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises on how to practice the electric guitar: part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" lies in the twelve-bar harmonic form, which you can repeat at will.
Anyone who is interested in music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
A puppeteer and puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be viewed here, has been working as a graphic designer since graduation twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, which is reportedly impossible to leave.
The guitarist is after his father, as well as his brother Matěj, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start training on a single string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can think of anything, just apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve," says Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the piece again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what can be invented with the twelve-string harmony and how nice it is starting to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of a song.
When you finally add the fourth one, beware of changing the tuning, points out Honza in the video.
Next time Honza will return to the pentatonic and you will try to put it together with just twelve.
So practice it honestly.
Best of all, you can read it in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his electric guitar school here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not a big celebration, admits Dvořák
We take the point and we are happy for it.
We had more chances in the first half, the second home," said the striker, who scored from the penalty kick this time.
You weren't nervous when he played, but he was accompanied by a huge whistle?
I didn’t really notice it, although on the second goal, where there are home fans, it would probably be worse.
You got the penalty after half an hour, but you also got the goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We overslept at the beginning, we were passive, it became a corner and then a penalty.
After that, you got up and in the first half you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well until the break after the goal.
In the cabin, we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game, but we couldn’t.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is also probably true that the home team said something about their game during the break, they were probably not very happy with it.
You only scored on the field of your opponent for the first time, while at home you may not have even scored a goal.
Why is it so different?
I wouldn't say it's that different, but it's up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plzeň, it is a different category.
Did you wait four games for the goal, were you not afraid that it might be similar after the last game?
I hope not, but of course we are glad that since the last game we do not have to listen to talk about waiting for the goal.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from miles away crater.
Lava that reaches the surface of Holuhraun, near the Vatnajokull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from a crater miles away.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This is what scientists are most concerned about...
For now, the situation remains unchanged.
As of yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flying out of the crack of approximately the same amount of lava.
Compared to the original estimates, however, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is 50x bigger.
However, scientists are concerned that the lava tunnel could open in places where it is located under the ice.
If this were to happen, moreover, with a similar intensity as shown by the current eruption, it would result in huge flooding, both on the Yukulsa and Fjollum rivers and on other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulfur around the eruption, clouds of steam and gases are rising from the crack.
It is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption at Fimmvaruháls in 2010.
This is much bigger, and there are also many more gases," says volcanologist Ármann Hoskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with almost no wind in the area in the morning.
The traces of the sandstorm were washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange stage (second highest) applies to Bararbunga and the yellow stage (third) applies to Askja.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on wings
A flying day in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 featured aerialist Peggy Walentin as she climbed from the cockpit to the trapeze on the biplane's upper wing and also between the wings.
It depends only on the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year and the organizers managed to prepare several interesting flight pieces.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport took place not only "walking on the wings" performed by the German aerobatic Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew attention to himself with his bright light.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the USA.
After the First World War, so many former war pilots tried to assert themselves.
However, due to a large number of fatal accidents, it was banned.
Today, however, he slowly returns to the program of air days.
Peggy climbs out of the cockpit onto the upper wing after takeoff.
There he performs various exercises.
At the end of the performance, she will move to the space between the wings of the airplane, where her show continues," said Luděk Matějíček from the Ultralight Club in Cheb and the organizer of the flight day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the highlight of the program, then the Mustang's subsequent performance was the proverbial icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter arrived on the surface with the Grippens of the Army of the Czech Republic in tow (so-called on the numbers).
This is the first time aviation fans in the Czech Republic have seen such a line-up.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone a breathtaking aerobatics with an airplane from 1945.
It was made during the war, but probably never participated in it.
He was listed in the Army Reserves.
From 1963 he worked in the civilian sphere.
As well as a racing aircraft.
Today it has its home hangar at the airport in Mnichovo Hradiště.
At the same place is also another pearl of the Cheb aviation day, the twin-engined Beechcraft C45H Expedition.
There was no way to miss the machine at the airport.
Its polished aluminum coating shone into the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force was also admired.
A small airliner caught off guard for a canceled Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation from Hof to the flight day.
German neighbours demonstrated in Cheb with reconstructed Jak 18T aircraft or a three-man formation of biplanes by B cker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhyová: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
At least for tonight, Lucie Borhy exchanged her parental worries for her work-related ones.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde presenter obviously does not know any of this.
She was doing well with her TV news, as if she hadn’t stopped for two months!
It’s only been two weeks since the blonde’s sixth birthday, when postpartum women experience the most stress.
However, Lucie will not appear regularly in the main news programme TV Nova.
According to Blesk.cz, it will be back in a month.
But now her daughter, Linda, needs her more than the television audience.
Lucie Borhyová returned to the TV screen and it was a hit.
Exhibition in a year in Prague?
The hall would sell out, planning a farewell Jagr
It would be nice if something like this were to happen during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union stands," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called "Golden Match", in which the breathtaking Nagano team met again.
Even the players who participated in the gold hattrick.
The players want to, right?
Absolutely.
It would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, during the tournament you can find one or two days when it is completely free and where you could mix such a match.
We will tell Gum (Jiří Šlégr) or Béďa Ščerban (the organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play in the New Jersey playoffs?
So when I fly in...
You don’t want to play in representation.
Or did the meeting in Jihlava somehow change your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things, and performances are decisive in representation.
It’s one thing that people would like to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who can do it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you enjoy the Nagano reunion?
The meeting with the players was great.
You've made your stories come alive and you've had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was a tribute to Ivan Hlinka.
And it’s good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving that was really worth it.
Slavomir Lener, Vladimír Ruzicka and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Are you still playing your first national match?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three young people: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we started in one of the three.
This was everyone’s first official start.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, that's impossible to say.
Dominik Hašek has been in Jihlava for a long time.
What did you think of his performance?
I’ll never be surprised on the ice.
I wanted to give him back with the criticism, but I can’t (Hašek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to finish in the national team).
He also did a great job with the Hnilička.
You were with me one night, and there was a hole.
And now he's catching a fable.
First the U.S. and then the Netherlands, the qualifying starts.
The NH Hotel in Smíchov was visited by prominent guests on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr Čech from Chelsea, national coach Pavel Vrba...
And over there, the figure in the black cap, that's Tomáš Rosický!
Arsenal midfielder and captain arrived at the rendezvous around 10:30.
We have a great game against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn’t be happy?” he said as he appeared in front of the press.
Programme of the Czech National Team
Monday, September 1st: start of reunion, first training
Tuesday 2nd September: Training open for fans (18:30, Letná) Autograph session (20:00)
Wednesday, September 3 Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday, September 9 Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná)
Rosický et al. can support fans before Wednesday's game against the USA (20:15).
The team opened Tuesday’s training for them, which starts at 6:30 p.m.
And it will be followed by an autograph session, which Rosický and Čech will not miss.
Otherwise, this national team meeting will be quieter.
This is what Coach Vrba, who has been complaining about a number of social events in the spring, praises.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now let’s focus on the Netherlands.
It is an advantage to have players together for eight days.
We will have time to rehearse things that we haven’t had so much time for before,” Vrba, who has been officially leading the national team since January, praised.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The team has three games under Vrba, all preparatory.
She tied 2-2 against Norway and Finland and lost 2-1 to Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
Not until now.
The match against the Netherlands will start qualifying for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it could also manage a general against the USA.
The first six months were to get to know each other.
The results are important now.
We have to think about being successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player in the 23-member nomination who has health problems is striker David Lafata.
He's worried about the temperature.
If he doesn't recover by Wednesday's game against the U.S., coach Vrba would have called up one more striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A British woman describes how, after a misdiagnosis, she thought she would die for many years.
After being diagnosed with another illness, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are believed to suffer from CMT, which can show motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
In those affected, numbness or pain can also occur, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms get worse.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that by the time she turned eighteen, she would be confined to a wheelchair, and dead by the time she turned thirty.
The mother of two, who is now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and it took me longer.
I’ve never been able to ride roller skates or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied at school because of the way I walked and ran.”
When Rodgers was thirteen and had several surgeries to loosen her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of the fact that her doctor had left the room, and consulted her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When they answered, I was in shock, totally panicked.
I thought that by the time I was eighteen, I would be in a wheelchair, and by the time I was twenty-five, I would be dead, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my powers.
I was all alone and planning my funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had anticipated, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, "Honey, I don't think you have the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair by now.
I think it's going to be something much less life-threatening."
After undergoing several genetic tests, he was found to have CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child,” she said.
CMT UK has launched CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area: with the turnaround of the economy, taxes are rising
A growing economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country has risen slightly over the past year, with firms in Washington being no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia collectively contributed $27.6 billion to state and local coffers for fiscal year 2013, up 3.8% from the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - rose 4.3% last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9% last year, and was the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes fell.
According to a study conducted by Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased by 3.9% faster than local taxes.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is from business tax, and 36% of Maryland's revenue is from companies.
Virginia, at 28%, exhibits proportionally the lowest tax revenue of any business.
The researchers say that the majority of tax revenue growth comes from increases in the value of property belonging to firms, which increased property taxes by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years of -1% growth.
Although most of the profits come from big states like California, New York, and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland, and Vriginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up 4.2 percent from $9.6 billion in 2012.
But the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not so much drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For businesses in Virginia and D.C., property taxes account for nearly half of state and local taxes.
“Maryland has a lot of corporate real estate, especially the tax base around D.C., government or non-profit organizations that don’t pay taxes,” Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation, said in a statement.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenue cannot be attributed solely to the healing real estate market.
According to the data, business income also appears to be increasing.
Companies in the region posted $2.3 billion in corporate income tax, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing as fast in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average level, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth rate was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax increase was below average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of 6% of the three counties (all of which have the same taxation).
Maryland's corporate tax rate is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia has a lower state and local taxation and an overall more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study did not evaluate.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces pressure from competition from the South.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing the corporate tax rate from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and will reduce the tax rate to 5% next year.
If the state continues to meet income targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could fall to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington do better and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
Business tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax - a structure of compensating for cost increases by which most businesses are organized - in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia last year rose 20% to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers say the trend and nationwide trade tax increases are likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenue for state and local governments increasing to 6.2% over the same period in the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington, however, may be lagging behind, as cutting state spending takes its toll on the labor market.
What you missed: Tusk will be Europe’s leader, Putin’s Novorussia and Lafat’s scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin calls for talks on Novorussia
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government troops have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that they will have a difficult return to the Russian market after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions.
The West’s support for the Ukrainian military in eastern Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
The end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so it cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions on Russia?
The Czech Republic has a right to disagree
The European Commission, along with diplomats, is due to propose a form of further toughening of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided tonight.
This was reported by Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent chairman of the meetings of the member states.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for shifting the form of sanctions are to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new president of the European Union.
Van Rompuy to be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected as the head of the European Council, the so-called EU president who chairs the summits of member states.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton will be replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian woman, who will thus become Vice-President of the future European Commission, still has to be confirmed in office by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, we just don’t talk about it
To help an incurable, long-suffering patient leave life behind?
In the Czech Republic, where the law does not allow euthanasia, this cannot be done legally.
However, doctors who have contacted the LN say they have heard of such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter of neurology, says doctor about sclerosis
Approximately 300 people in the Czech Republic suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 21 patients undergo experimental stem cell treatment in Motol, Prague.
We don’t know for sure if it will be successful.
But if we don’t try, we won’t find out,” says Radim Mazanec, a Motol neurologist.
There's a CIA handwriting, they needed a war, writes Huml about the downing of flight MH17
ČSSD MP Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
"It is clear that the heavy sanctions that have been announced with regard to the downing of a civilian aircraft with almost 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian military," he said.
In addition, according to the lawmaker, the CIA's handwriting is known.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are coming up, and the parties are offering the impossible again.
The end of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and a cable car above Prague.
This is repeated before every election: the parties promise the impossible.
Even now, with the local elections approaching, politicians are racing to see who will like the voters more.
The server Lidovky.cz has chosen unfulfillable promises from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkirk.
A fierce siege has begun
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Liška constantly asked for additional technical equipment and sent to the front.
The British side eventually complied and included this land force as one of their forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SUMMARY: Plzeň leads the league in front of the Prague "S", Liberec declassed Baník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, which he leads by a point in front of both Prague "S".
Changes at the top of the table caused the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the domestic league, thanks to two of Lafat's hits she defeated Jablonec.
The record win in the year was awarded to Liberec, who shot up Baník Ostrava 6:0.

How to survive the return from vacation?
Don’t hurry and get some sleep.
The last days of vacation are upon us.
Getting used to the normal working pace after returning from a sunny beach or cottage can be a challenge for many.
It can also be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with the changed situation: do not rush and get a good night’s sleep.
Joan Rivers' Family: "Keeping Our Fingers crossed"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days, ever since she was brought to a New York City hospital, but her daughter said today that she has not lost hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover.
“Thank you for your greetings and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
Fingers crossed.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to emergency services said she had suffered a cardiac arrest on an Upper East Side endoscopy, the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under close supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains "serious".
Reactions have not been long in coming, including incredible online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a twisted headline
That the media is distorting reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, more apt than the word annoys me.
This is particularly true of the Israeli-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines “Israel Attacks Gaza” are quite common.
In the text, you will read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to fired rockets from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
It will then appear under the headline "Both sides broke the ceasefire".
Is the journalistic community aware that their actions directly contribute to the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
It has not been 60 years since the end of World War II.
There are still survivors of the Shoah.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted "Jewish pigs" and such atrocity, it stuck.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that after the Jews were destined to destroy the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as the "guardian dogs of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided to destroy the Czech nation and wipe the Czech Republic off the map?
Perhaps you should also note one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship reside in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're fine.
If you ask them why they don’t go among “their own”, for example, to Gaza, they will answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and top-class health care (I have seen for myself how Arabs regularly go to the top private hospital Hadassah, which is funded by donations from Jews from all over the world, and they are naturally treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus to this troubled region, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, even indirectly in the headlines.
Inform Hamas about its practices, about its abuse of people as human shields.
Hamas’s goal is to destroy the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of innocent Arab children.
Hamas is on the list of the world’s terrorist organizations.
For nine years of self-government in Gaza, the area has been able to flourish thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which Gaza administrators do not pay and even get upset that the power supply is interrupted at times at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels to be penetrated by suicide bombers in Israel, but in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, for example, his Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed Monday morning's information claim: An online retailer - a video producer and hundreds of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, Google’s $1 billion Twitch sale seemed certain, and the connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded by Justin.tv just three years ago, was set to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players to stream online from games to it - in the words of Business Insider's "YouTube for Live Streaming".
Twitch Interface.
There are already popular "Let's play" videos on YouTube, the kind where sages (mostly older) give games a processing of Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes up with a lot when describingTwitch, so the news that YouTube is buyingTwitch didn’t excite anyone much, it was a textbook example of how an established company pays off a possible competitor.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube didn’t work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
In a statement, Twitch CEO Emmet Shear said: “We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us achieve it faster.
Another mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they prefer to do sports rather than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about games instead of just watching them.
It's one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder playing Resident Evil at 3:00 a.m., and quite another to watch a stranger get 20 shots in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are from a player's perspective, so looking at their footage without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a hemlock.
I admit that speed run games, in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic age complete the game in record time, is fun.
But unless someone is a master of acting or humor, their Twitch channel probably won’t be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is fourth on the top of Internet traffic.
How will Amazon use it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch blending into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it might have been swallowed up by YouTube.
But Twitch has something every company wants to attract: the hordes of young men advertisers want.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, both Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of games" and the media doesn't seem reluctant, even as - swallowed - by viewers.
The second lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the subject of "The Holy Scriptures are God's Word."
Attached original video.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that conflict with their religion, they often put us in front of the question: Who will you believe?
The Word of God or the Word of Man?
It is as if human inquiry is nothing compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine to have.
But when they say "man," they're talking about science.
And when they refer to the word of God, they refer to myths about God written by men.
If there really is an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is he who has created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who has devised the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who has supplied the other lines of evidence that point exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion down to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It's like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulize.
And it was the people who wrote all those texts pretending to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as being written by men, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were written by none other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really was one true god, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the uber-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of this size had ever written a book, there would have been only one such book, a single scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels, or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors could not compare to such a work.
And people would not have to blindly believe it, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal a profound morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God had written it, we would have expected nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions with no common origin, and they are all constantly disintegrating into increasingly separate denominations, seeking disputed truths, and each claiming God's guidance in some way, regardless of the ongoing divergences and separations in each direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lláh's Kitáb-i-Akdas, Zarathustra's Avestas, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Book of Urantia are all regarded as "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the one true God" and appropriate believers to each of them.
The only logical explanation is that to some extent everyone is wrong.
None of the books mentioned above has any advantage over the others.
None of them has any evidence, and none can be confirmed historically.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I’m not saying that I’ve proven the Bible to be reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apology (defences), because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered to be true, which have already been overcome.
So they cannot be claimed to be proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote abominable atrocities instead of morals, and many are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecies, each of which may also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and are therefore subject to interpretations, impressions, and perspectives by their primitive and often prejudice-bound politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, I would call it a mutual comment.
We have to point out again that we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not an eyewitness account!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources just for the Pentateuch, i.e. the five Books of "Moses" and Moses do not attribute authorship to any of them, since it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as the believer thinks.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological texts known for their unfinished basis of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Docetes and the Ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined into a kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as the Luciferians were dispersed and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these adaptations refers to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young religion of Moses, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebul, the "Lord on the Mount" changed to Beelzebub the "Lord of the Flies".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commission decisions at the Diet of Nikaia.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by simple raising their hands, as if the fact of any matter could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The manner in which the canon developed depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers of the day.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon thus evolved from the usefulness of the early church.
So the Council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that were circulating among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also knowingly removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referred to by approved books.
Among the rejected items we find the writings of both apostles and prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are just people’s words and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the actual author of this haphazard jumble of rumors, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was definitely written by humans and certainly not by very enlightened ones, rather the opposite!
That is why so much of its content is wrong historically and scientifically, from beginning to end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, believed in incantations, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology, and the five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic wand to splash blood on someone, it would cure him of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants, and bats are birds, and whales are fish, and pi is an integer.
These people believed that if they showed a pregnant cow striped patterns, she would give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended to be a literal history, then it would contain nothing at all of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who condoned or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, family abuse, child abuse, child violence, abortion, looting, murder, sexual orientation, genocide, and prejudice against race, nation, religion.
To justify their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
Creationists, however, continue to ignore all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact contradicts the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why is that?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, they are one and the same.
Ironically, they reject God’s “work” as “worship of creation instead of creator.”
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and God himself, and even insist that the refutation of their supposedly "holy" books somehow refutes God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate doctrine from divinity.
So this is a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were God himself because they think they are HIS word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their supposedly "unchanged word" of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often deliberately altered and distorted by simply erring people.

Chinese school attacker stabs nine people, three of them dead
A man named Chen, according to the New China Agency, violently broke into the elementary school building in the morning and attacked around 10:30 a.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chen later killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one child, in line with government policy.
He showed the first-graders in Lány how he had to sit in school
The youngest students were taken to their classroom, where they waited with the teacher for the arrival of the president.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, which fortunately does not await you, you are already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then handed over the puzzle as a gift to the first-graders.

Czech Education Minister Marcel Chládek started the new school year in a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to connect Czech schools with Czech sport more," he explained one of the reasons why the first day of school went to North Bohemia.
The school management recently approached him at a hockey game in Litvínov.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to participate in the beginning of the school year," the minister added.
Czech Education Minister Marcel Chládek (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD) started the school year in a private sports school in Litvínov.
This year, 115,000 first-graders entered the first class.
A total of 850,000 children will attend primary schools and more than 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, according to the Education Ministry.

Apple iCloud Reportedly Killed By Hackers, Reveals Nude Images of Celebrities
Screenshot with leaked files
Meanwhile, an anonymous user posted nude and pornographic images of American celebrities on 4chan, according to Mashable.com.
Allegedly, it gained them by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where the affected users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet addressed the issue.
Some celebrities dismiss the images as fake, but several have already admitted the authenticity of the images.
These include actress Jennifer Lawrence, best known for her role as Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in Die Hard 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the obtained images and videos for enrichment.
U.S. magazines reportedly showed interest in the footage, but according to reports on 4chan, the hacker prefers to get money from the community.
According to The Next Web, this is very likely a weakness in iCloud security.
Two days ago, GitHub came up with a tool that allowed users to gain passwords to their accounts through brute force, by automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
This tool has been proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before releasing this tool.
As a precaution, iCloud users should change their password associated with their Apple ID.
The important thing is the length of the password, not its complexity.
A length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The leak of nude images of celebrities is considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are many times more secure than computers in homes or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it runs only on wi-fi and when connected to a charger.

A Smart Way to Save on College Scripts
As the cost of undergraduate scripts for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the prospective second-year student came up with a smart way to cut costs.
He devised a system of lending books from senior classmates with a nominal compensation offer to hold back their sale.
“I got a math book that normally costs $180 a semester for 10 and chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the University Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have a variety of options to manage these expenses.
Online stores and creative solutions like Schroeder’s are the students’ preferred choice.
Lending textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use the book for a semester, often at a significant discount, than if they had bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores on campuses, says lending of books has doubled since 2011.
The industry survey shows that around a quarter of books in university bookstores were borrowed last spring, according to Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the textbooks are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Shops.
Here are the 101 best ways to succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some new books on the Internet may be up to a third lower than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $ 290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new one at Chegg.com, a bookstore specialized in textbooks, for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don’t mind other people’s comments or wear and tear, the learning texts used are a good option.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" sells for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, senior year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.
The new one sold for $48.
University lecturer Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not important for seminar work.
If so, older versions can be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is also a popular alternative for buying used books.
Lending
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on your new book.
For example, a student could borrow a "Calculus" for about $20 for an entire semester.
Learn the terms and conditions of the store in which you are borrowing the book, including penalties for notes, highlighting, or wear and tear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don’t return the book on time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to buy an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "Calculus" for six months for approximately $61.
According to Bracey, the best deals can be found by students of literary courses, as many classics are now available for free download, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be joining Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order the book online, make sure it’s really in stock, Gault advises.
He saw it for himself.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay full price for a book from a university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found a torso of a rifle from the end of the war in the well
The well is near St. George's Church.
We uncovered the vegetation around and began to pull out the age-old deposit - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
When we were nearing the clay bottom, we hit the barrel," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it, and found it to be the torso of an assault German rifle used by SS units.
The finding is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," added Novak.
All wooden construction things have decayed over time, so it is unusable.
But her body is preserved - it keeps its shape.
How did it get in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown by people who needed to get rid of the weapon used by the SS units, probably out of fear of being relegated.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were throwing guns in the woods," the finder said.
The rifle was the only thing that the fans of the Rainbow Jeseníky movement found in the well.
"There may have been hand grenades, there were a lot of them around once, so we slowed down the excavation work, carefully felt the mud so that there was no misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.
The find will end up in the museum’s depository at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian General: I Haven't Liberated a Captured Czech Yet
An exclusive interview with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who is acquitting Ukrainian soldiers from being captured by pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Excuse me, I have to take this... they are calling me from Donetsk," Ukrainian Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban, who is also the director of the Center for the Liberation of Prisoners of War, said in an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
With each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers or the places where they are - or should be - that Ruban specifies with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"That will be it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot, and an active participant in the anti-government protests on Maidan.
Yesterday, when we arranged a conversation, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists is carried out 24 hours a day.
Q: You may know that the Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates they're up to 30.
Of course, there may be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have already liberated captured Serbs, Dagestanis, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but not Czech yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captive compatriot and we can free him.
Ukrainian Soldier Captured by Separatists
A.cz: What advice do you give to Czechs who join pro-Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they are fighting in the Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will shoot them without mercy, just like any other foreigner.
Separatists consider these men to be mercenaries for hire, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - including a Czech - they put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
This guy will survive.
The Ukrainian side also behaves like a state in war.
Q: How many Ukrainian prisoners have you saved?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say that it has already exceeded a hundred men.
We stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we only freed them... they didn't save them from the war if they decided to continue fighting.
Rescuers are doctors, surgeons at war, but we certainly aren't.
That's it.
And every day more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
It doesn’t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes a mere human request is enough to release the captives.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust from the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of both warring sides?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev nicknamed me "Mad General with Steel Balls".
I'm not offended.
And maybe it captures the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian officers' corps, I have gained some such authority before.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
No matter what happens, I'm honest and I'm telling the truth.
Even if it makes the Ukrainian government or the Donetsk or Luhansk government very uncomfortable.
Do they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they are being tortured and killed.
And that they are crimes.
I often risk my life, even being captured in a prisoner exchange... this job could be the end for me at any moment... I don't have to go back.
Q: How many executions and tortures do you know of?
... (long pause) ... Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture during interrogations.
Unfortunately.
And the executions?
It only happens on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners of war.
There is no evidence that the Ukrainian military is doing anything like this.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can not and do not want to give the numbers.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
They include military officers as well as veterans of Afghanistan.
They seek independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are irreconcilable opponents - to the death.
As we say, they ate up to their throats.
By the way, the same dreams and aspirations were expressed on Maidan.
Russia supports the separatists and the West supports the Ukrainian state.
One speculation is great and the other is small.
But this sentence of mine already hides an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: For example, what does one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists Igor Bezler look like to you?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I am unarmed and show soldiers or militants my bare hands.
And I'm always on both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters in the crosshairs or in the optical sight.
I can always see the faces of the people who are pointing at me... and they can pull the trigger on their guns at any time.
Paratrooper, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small gubernia in the great Russian Empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it and considers Ukraine to be a misunderstanding.
Such a state should not exist.
At the same time, it is an implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the discussion show of Ukrainian television, you called your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk a weak, clueless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
For those three hundred meters of walking, I always get scared at least five times.
So why should I hide the opinion that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
Q: Do you think he was involved in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians call Yatsenyuk a "rabbit".
And the rabbit is not, in the eyes of Ukrainians, an animal of fear or respect and authority in the eyes of others.
Its behavior directly copies that of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament, to beg, to play tricks on him, to threaten to lay down his office... he must run the country, manage it, and protect it in time of war.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest from tearful emotions.
He is the first Minister of Ukraine.
And Yatsenyuk?
She acts like a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he was never strong... he does not fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything all the time.
So he should leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why Guardians of the Galaxy failed to save sales
Sylvester Stallone’s expendable 3 returned less than $30 million from a 90-million dollar budget in the U.S., and Sin City: A Dame to Kill for returned only $12 million from a 70-million budget.
Cameron Diaz's Sex Tape grossed only $14.6 million in its first weekend, and children's films such as How to Train Your Dragon 2 were also disappointing for cinemas.
According to Robbie Collin, a film critic at The Telegraph, the quality of children's films is to blame.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year of children's films, and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to movies set to a slightly older target audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic's servers and their average ratings of summer film premieres aired in at least 2,000 theaters between Victims of War Day and July 20 in 2013 and that year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both viewers and film critics, suggest that this year's film harvest is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, the change in the approach of viewers and the increased popularity of Internet servers like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's adaptation of The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what has already been.
In contrast to the current crisis of Hollywood box office blockbusters, Netflix’s net worth was $1.2 billion, almost twice last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too much on comic book rights, and predicted the "collapse" of Hollywood.
In light of the current slump, some commentators say there may be something to his catastrophic prophecy.
With the release of possible big box office blockbusters in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions, and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the decline in sales simply "cyclical," saying to The Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the summer of the biggest box office blockbusters in history, and no one will worry about selling."
North Korea threatens Seoul with another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The alleged test of the missile took place shortly after the end of joint military maneuvers by the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as a preparation for an invasion.
Chagang Province lies in the north-west of the KDLR near the border with China.
A spokesman for South Korea's defense ministry said the missiles were fired from a point in North Korea's north-west and had flown within 200 kilometers.
North Korea may have fired a missile from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
The province is said to have an underground launch pad for Scud-type missiles.
This is another in a series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in the anti-NATO march.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending a night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday noon.
When they did not return home, concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m.
A search party was dispatched, including local police and a rescue team, and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with them overnight and were picked up Monday morning.
In a stable condition, they were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the win was on the leg of Yours
The 23-year-old forvard could have made the decision, but he failed in his two biggest chances.
After the goal called mainly shot close three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended on goalie Opava Josef Květoň.
I had it on my leg, so I have to give it a chance.
“I’m angry at myself,” he said, dropping ashes on his head.
"I guess I should have put it under the lid, it got a little off," he mused.
The Sigma defense did not allow much, except for Mikul's 11th minute raid, which was covered by goalie Reichl.
Then the Hanáci started to push, but they were not allowed into the home block and Květoň caught the shots from a distance.
We compared ourselves for 15 minutes, then took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more from the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But your chance did not change, and so it ended 0-0," Hanák coach Leoš Kalvoda said.
Opava also took the point due to absences in the lineup, where apart from the two injured, Petr Vavřík was also missing with three-goal shooter Petr Ševčík, who is a guest from Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike their previous policy, it did not allow them to enter.
Substitutes deserve discharge.
Sigma was more football-like, but with one standard we didn’t let it do anything,” Silesian coach Petr Baránek said.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma tied for four points, marking thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the boss of the club Josef Lébra, who after the defeat with Znojmo conditioned his million-dollar deposit into the box office with diametrically different performances in subsequent matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébra's warning, so there can't be any talk of the boys not wanting to fight," Kalvod noticed, adding to the sleeping shooter Vašíček: "I believe that it will come and when he scores a goal, it will begin to fall.
But after the first hit, I’ll replace him right away so he can save his goals for the next matches,” Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has twice impressed Venice.
The film festival is in crisis.
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Inárritu suddenly became one of the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days gave the impression that interest in the 71st edition of the festival in Venice had somewhat declined.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed but less appealing films as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia of the 1960s.
Heroes of Comics
Not even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has been besieged by such crowds as in the past, and it has reportedly ceased to be a problem to get a place in the hotel at the last minute.
The crisis is more talked about in Italy than anywhere else, and it is no wonder that it has affected such esteemed institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in a lack of personalities, but only in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for autographs from comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who have played dramatic roles in 99 homes, the main event for all generations was the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino.
He also starred in two films.
In an out-of-competition story shot by Academy Award-winning Barry Levison based on Philip Roth’s novel, 74-year-old Pacino has a role close to him: an actor at the height of his fame who suffers from end-of-life and career depressions.
But seeing him the next day as the oddball hardware store owner from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, shot by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi’s Best Actor award should not miss it - but does the artist of Pacin’s format still need awards?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian in particular, for although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly claims the country from which his grandparents came.
Points for Italians
The Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film after Birdman to be rewarded with a long standing ovation.
The Calabrian Mafia branch is looked at by looking at the family relationships between clans fighting for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a good script, a camera, music and actors.
He was also intrigued by the intimate psychothriller Hungry Hearts, which was filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost kills her own child with her misguided anxiety.
On the other hand, French competition films have not received a warm reception, neither the Ransom for Glory, nor 3 Hearts, both works based on the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really excellent films, namely Birdman and Black Souls, are not so few for the first half of the festival.
And while the festival’s films have mostly depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich’s new film, She’s Funny That Way, an off-the-record comedy set in Venice and shot in the style of 1940s American merrymaking, was able to lift the mood for more than a day.
Police in Prague caught four manufacturers of meth, drugs were brought from Poland
"Detectives have arrested three men, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a 25-year-old woman, who produced and sold the meth drug in Prague 9 from last November until this August," police spokeswoman Jana Rosslerová said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, an intervention unit in Cihlářská Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person, and a young woman in the group appeared as a drug buyer in Poland and a dealer of benefits.
The following day, detectives arrested another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, on the basis of prior consent.
The last of the four police officers was caught in the Wednesday morning hours of August 20 in the Malešice incinerator,” the spokesperson said.
For transporting drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of activity.
In the workshop of the airfield, in the garden house in Horomerice, in an apartment in Koněvova Street and other places in Prague 9, he produced meth, procured various aids and chemicals needed for its production and arranged the transport of pseudoephedrine drugs from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighed the manufactured drug, divided it into plastic bags and subsequently sold meth.
He was helped by a 25-year-old unpunished woman to transport medicines from Poland or sell them to drug addicts.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the produced drug," added Rossler.
Under the judge’s orders, the investigators also carried out several house searches, where they seized drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, salary bags, syringes, tubing, and other items that experts say can be considered complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been arrested seven times since 1995.
"From the available records, police officers then found that the main organizer had been punished seven times since 1995 for property crime, the woman was not punished in court," the police spokesperson added.
The last detainee was convicted of sexual misconduct in 2006 and the 37-year-old auto mechanic, who is being prosecuted at large, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
It was mostly a property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing the crime of illicit manufacturing and other handling of narcotics, psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to 10 years in prison.
The investigator eventually filed a motion for custody with three persons, where they were eventually placed by the judge," the spokesperson said.
The fourth accused, a 37-year-old recidivist, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as fundamental as that of the other accused.
Police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things in its other products at very "interesting" prices.
As a good example, in Italy, hand-made chess with a board of 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, make sure you have more than $40,000.
The exact price is 43,405 CZK.
The customer gets a set of wooden black and red painted figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fiber.
It should come as no surprise that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a buoyant horse at their disposal.
If chess doesn’t seem like a good enough gift, a Ferrari 500 F2 made (by hand, of course) at a scale of 1:1,8 is also available.
The price of this toy is CZK 318,305.
School and high school closures don’t make sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics show that gymnasts have a good job.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There has been a lot of preparation in schools over the past 14 days.
It's mostly routine stuff, like moving pots from summer storage back to classrooms and getting chalk.
They're going to have a little bit more trouble at Hořice Grammar School.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature for the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year grammar school in Hořice opens and resumes its activities after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders were so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by entering it in the register of schools administered by the Ministry of Education.
"French socialists should shut up and put France in order," says key ally of Francois Hollande
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to “show its support” for a warlike socialist president whose redistribution of functions has not met with the approval of a majority of French people.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
“Our duty is to remain by his side,” he said, applauding.
As a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge France’s controversial 35-hour work week, despite heated speculation from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister who proposed loosening the rules earlier this week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to remain “cohesive” with the government.
But Christiane Taubir, the Justice Minister, drew a line over the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for "having made the French lose faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, leader of the ultra-conservative right, laughed at the ongoing internal divisions among socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked, and so is Prince Manuel Valls. They were forced to form a new government, when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
“And the new one won’t last until the end of autumn or winter,” Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament, stating that she believed it could win early elections for the party and that she was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French think the Socialist Party runs the risk of splitting into several rival factions before Hollande’s term ends in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It's a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes taking place in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit the elections in Prague
Changes to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new management of the capital.
No more gambling halls will disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will also be no restrictions on dogs.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees before the October elections.
"Moreover, the decision on changes should not be made by the current management of the city, which is ending its mandate in a few weeks," city councilor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09) said.
Several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish gambling across the board in recent weeks.
But the game won't go away, the gambling decree won't change yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the elections.
Now we wouldn’t be able to do it technically, for example, given the deadlines for comments and so on,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment to the decree, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on a blanket ban on gambling is planned on the day of the municipal elections of the Prague 1 and Prague 8 districts.
Currently, gambling is banned in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the ordinance will not change in the case of street art, so-called busking.
Prague 1, which has already sent a proposal to the municipality, is complaining about this, which it would like to extend the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians don't want Prague 5 around Anděl either.
The ordinance regulating dog walking has been in the works for several months, but has not yet been completed.
The location of the game rooms and the issue of busking are dealt with by city ordinances.
They may be issued or modified only by the City Council.
Councillors have only an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue ordinances themselves.
Last week, he placed victory at the fingertips of supporters of Scottish independence.
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making the mistake a third time, when it almost put a question on billboards all over Scotland about whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you don’t get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor do you earn their respect when you start threatening them.
The morals of the New Testament are still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots are far more likely to drive the money changers out of the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
Scottish nationalist leader Alex Salmond is well aware of this and has repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, in a televised debate whether he is willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters would vote for independence and start supporting a single currency for both Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and with grimace he fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the Scottish electorate's mandate.
But the debate over Scotland’s currency has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, job opportunities and defence of the public health that citizens get for free.
Darling supported London’s bankers and gave the impression that he would not object to the privatization of health care.
As Salmond put it, he "went into bed with the Conservatives".
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not to voters, but to the "bosses' association", the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron’s refusal to discuss independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee landlord.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron said Scotland could be a “successful independent country.”
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it causes him almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots should not jump up and have to accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of school according to Miloš Urban

The end was the best of the holidays, the last week, which was no longer going anywhere and we were just lounging around with the Indian summer, the silence before the storm, the calm before the stress.
New clothes when you could get them from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading Fast Arrows, for the fifth time, whistling on a bicycle up past the Imperial all the way back to Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun was caressing your back and shoulders, tapping the rays to say goodbye.
In the evening a slight nervousness, still a holiday regime, sleep until half past eleven, in a week it will be worse, moments before falling asleep stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then in the morning get up at half seven.
Monday's coming.
Usually it doesn't rain, on the contrary, the summer is maliciously sneered at in front of the school.
To use the ghostly light on a slap and feel like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there is that school, ZŠŠ A.
Zápotocký with a monstrously pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys longer, girls bustier.
There are thugs out there to avoid, and it's interesting how unmistakably they stick together and how early they're here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came in jinxed are laughing hysterically at something right now, I guess something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while for me everything is the same.
And new first-graders, some nervous and others excited, why do they come here at all?
Because they have to, educational warfare is mandatory.
Then in, the cool humidity of the floor and the slight smell of disinfection, a poisoned janitor with a mop, unfortunately still the same one that is said to lend the pupil a key to a tin box, where textbooks can be left and of which there are still so few.
For a bottle.
The smell of the dressing room remains in the memory, now it does not take place, it is nicely aired, but in a week it will be worse.
Just the thought of it makes my stomach hurt and my head starts to hurt.
A head that is even worse in mathematics, that devilish game for the elect, which I am not and never will be.
Again the threes and fours, God forbid the fives, hide from the rehearsals, fit into the bench and best to sublimate, to be there and not to be, to exist only as a name in the classroom and to dream up stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas into space, where no one competes with anyone, humiliates anyone and pats anyone' foot.
The longest year is 10 months.
And it's only day one, just like years ago.
She left her daughters to die.
She's facing an extraordinary punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the booth of the public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without anyone’s help, she gave birth to a little girl who, after cutting her umbilical cord, she wrapped in a prepared blanket, hid it under her jacket and carried it to a roadside feeder, where she placed it in bushes located several tens of meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
I guess it came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I had to go to the bathroom, where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors that I carried to school," the defendant said, adding that she was ashamed of the pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the place, put the body of the child in a backpack and took it away, removed the body from the backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid and left it under the staircase in her grandmother's house in Havlíčkův Brod," the lawsuit states, adding that it is not entirely clear when the newborn's death occurred.
It could have been tens of minutes, but also several hours after birth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or when put under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an unbound umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman gave birth secretly herself again between February and April 12, when the corpse of the child was found by random witnesses under a bush near a pond in Havlíčkův Brod.
This time in the bathroom of a loft apartment in a family house.
Without verifying that she was born alive, without cutting or tying the umbilical cord wrapped around her neck, she placed the baby in several plastic containers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
In the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the pond.
Finally a friend gave it to her.
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, who was allegedly unaware of the partner’s pregnancy.
For this reason, he is not currently on trial, he was only punished for his transgression of the Funeral Act.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accessory.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution wasn't right, but it felt human at the time," said the defendant, who was reportedly in a relationship with the man and feared him.
In the course of her testimony, the young woman spoke fairly evenly.
Tears came to her eyes as she spoke of her relationship with her parents, from whom she had left when she reached adulthood.
She said she didn’t want to kill
“They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don’t deserve it,” she said.
I didn't buy the equipment because I didn't want children, I felt young.
I still wanted to put it in the babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I can't explain it to you," she replied to the judge.
She refused, however, to act with reason and intent to kill the newborn.
The second child, according to her, was born dead.
During her pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
However, I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
“I also quit smoking,” she said.
Although she could be seen pregnant in both cases, she told everyone, even when asked repeatedly, that she had health problems, that she was irrigated.
Even my friend.
The trial will continue at the court on Tuesday with the testimony of court experts.
A verdict could be handed down on Wednesday.
Women face up to 18 years in prison or an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise closes in on $3 billion acquisition of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the world's third-largest cruise operator, has advanced in negotiations to buy Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company rivaling larger rivals Royal Carrebian Cruises Ltd. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp. (CCL.N), access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and affluent clientele.
The deal could be published this week, the source said Sunday, but said the talks may still not end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not wish to be named because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment on the situation.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company’s revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13% from 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported sales of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6% from the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise segment is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming year.
Companies are competing to become the preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offering with U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has held a majority stake in the company since the deal closed in 2007 for $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with cruise operator owned Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casino businesses controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise launched its shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to regulatory filings, Genting held a 28% stake, Apollo a 20% stake and private equity firm TPG Capital LP an 8% stake.
According to the registration dossier, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of North American passenger volume.
Hong Kong pro-democracy activists provoke Chinese authorities one day after voting decision
A group of people loyal to Beijing waved the Chinese flag.
The Standing Commission of the National People's Congress approved on Sunday that only two out of three candidates should participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first get the support of an appointment committee, which will probably consist of members loyal to Beijing.
The decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on ballot papers and get pro-democracy activists to renew the pledge and cripple Hong Kong's financial center with protests by the "Occupy Central" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is a major cause of tension, Chinese leaders fear the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report in June outlining China's official authority in Hong Kong, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in the special official district, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference, which will be attended by Prime Minister Li, is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei Offices were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start talks with eastern Ukraine on “state sovereignty”
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “state sovereignty” of the breakaway areas.
Its spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin’s remark was not intended to imply that the separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking area the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s call for the Kiev government to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equals is consistent with an apparent strategy that has followed since the outbreak of the unrest five months ago: Help the separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya de facto independence so that it can ally itself with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with state television channel 1, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to recapture the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken over by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently labeled the occupied territory “Novorossia” or “New Russia,” a term that refers to the glorious pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian news agency Itar-Tass published Putin’s words that the “prisoner of illusions” is anyone who believes that peace negotiations are on the horizon, as Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns ahead of the October 26 parliamentary elections, while government troops are attacking civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"In the interest of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of state sovereignty of the south-east of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s allusion to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been under discussion with Kiev’s leadership for several months, to alleviate concerns by Russian-speaking areas about threats to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The intervention by the Kremlin spokesman, which was supposed to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks, highlighted the Russian leadership’s approach to solving the separatist insurgency in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two million population originally belonged to ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russians, and opinion polls conducted before the conflict showed widespread support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international fora would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, effectively giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia’s main naval fleet, maritime trading facilities, and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Rostov and Crimea are also the center of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his June 7 inaugural address, suggested that Ukraine's lawmakers - after the new election - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy differs significantly from that of the Kremlin and the separatists, and Moscow is accused of arming and fomenting violence.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equals followed a further advance by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov penetrated eastern Ukraine.
The separatists, reinforced by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear it is a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This spurred a huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, calling for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
“We are approaching a point of no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for additional sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Greece are also involved in the scandal.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who likely stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence went viral in the biggest celebrity hacking scandal.
Hacker claims to have 60 photos with naked Hunger Games star Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Due to the iCloud leak, personal photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Greece were also reportedly leaked.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greece last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It's a shame that personal information can be stolen and leaked to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, told the online newspaper that the hack was “shameless” and that those who were targeted “felt humiliated.”
It is believed that the hacker obtained thirty pictures of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of him lying topless by the pool.
Palmer appeared in the film Love and Honor, opposite Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, television series star Chuck Strahovski, and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
Representative Lawrence TMZ said, "This is a clear violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen tweeted: “Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
Legally, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma players make up for Lébra, even without winning
Thunder and lightning, which co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be a thing of the past.
In the end, though, they only got a point behind the goalless draw.
By deploying and fighting, the club's boss after all reconciled a little.
Payroll money could be coming to the club soon.
“I’ll keep one more game, as I talked about last week, but I’m much more optimistic,” Lebr confirmed, adding that despite the fact that Sigma didn’t win, he was convinced by the improved performance.
“The fighting and commitment that we played in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive him for not winning.
If we had played that way from the start of the season, I’m sure we haven’t lost yet,” Lebr said.
Sigma in Opava withstood the initial pressure of the home team, then the game evened out and in the second half was already better.
After the victory Kalvod's wards reached, but their options did not reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our expectations.
To our complete satisfaction, however, we were missing only one chance," said Lebr, who does not think that the change in attitude of the footballers was caused only by his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
Either from my side, from the coach's side, or from the fans' side," Lebr said.
With the pressure, Sigma must count.
The players did not want to comment on the events of last week after the game in Opava.
I'm trying to put these things away.
I tried not to admit it," the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl shook his head.
The striker Václav Vašíček, who did not turn Sigma’s biggest opportunity into a Saturday match, left the question completely without comment on Lébrov’s statement from last week.
Then he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We'll always be under pressure.
They all want to come at us.
"Today we showed that if we fight and ride on our asses, we can do it," he said.
They took the warning to heart.
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hide that the preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized that, and today you could see that they took Mr. Lébra's warning to heart.
Even though it wasn’t about them not wanting to fight and they slouched it,” the Olomouc coach said.
It was like the first 15 minutes.
It took us a while to come to terms with the hardness and realize what the second league is about.
"It's not just about football, it's about fighting," Kalvoda said.
We can only hope that in the next matches Sigma will work from the beginning.
“I would love to believe it,” he added.
