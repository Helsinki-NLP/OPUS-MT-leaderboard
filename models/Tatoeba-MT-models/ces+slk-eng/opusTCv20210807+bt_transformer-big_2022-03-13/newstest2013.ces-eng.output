Republican Party strategy against Obama re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies on the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center calls such fraud a myth, saying that voter fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican advocates have only seen 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, individual states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments since 2009 have enacted new laws that make it difficult to vote or register.
This was followed by the November 2010 election, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were tabled in 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, invalidate the right to register on the electoral roll on the day of the election, and revoke the right to vote for citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to submit a photo ID.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indian law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to expand this procedure to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have backed bills like this in 34 states to force voters to present photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million voting age citizens, do not own a photo ID issued by their state government.
Furthermore, about five million new voters do not have such an identity card in 2012.
In addition, acquiring the required identity card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people on low incomes.
Therefore, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income below $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their attachment to Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who elect rather Republican candidates to use cards issued by these clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for elections.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
As of 2011, about a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes cast by the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states backed legislation that scraps voter registration on election day.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to enrol.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million inhabitants.
However, measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% decrease in the number of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states passed laws aimed at shortening the term for elections in advance.
For example, during the 2008 Florida general election, African-Americans made up 33% of the electorate that voted in advance, even though the African-American electorate in that state was only 13%.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who made up 76% of all voters, made up just 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have strongly opposed passing laws that restrict voter registration.
Democratic governors blocked several bills with their vetoes.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, even the Attorney General of the United States intervened.
The damage was partially reduced.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the submission of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics mainly speak of the bias of the approved laws and see them as an apparent effort to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that states where these laws have been passed account for 171 of the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the presidential election.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: to undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test sometimes produced erroneous results that were wrongly negative or even wrongly positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this increased the hesitation of men who were already reluctant to go to the examination at all.
To be examined or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the USA showed a high level of contamination among the individual test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, found a difference in mortality between patients who underwent the test and those who did not.
This study also showed that those who did not undergo the test had a 30-40% higher risk of metastases.
Therefore, I recommend screening from the age of 50 or 40 if your immediate relative has had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and those that are inert.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer, which does not affect life in the long term, and to focus in these cases on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are left untreated because their cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Rather, we will suggest active surveillance and offer treatment in the event of disease progression.
Increasingly, and with greater precision, we are setting criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not.
Nevertheless, I recommend that you take the test.
However, it is important to consult a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no magic formula for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle principles seems the best way to reduce disease risks.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy food and exercised enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If everyone quit smoking, that figure would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers cause heredity.
A certain percentage is also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even as the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes are responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight
Body weight and obesity are another risk factor for the disease, according to SCC.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
With too much consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is advisable to avoid sausages, for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet come to clear conclusions.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to SCC.
Although according to one of them the risk of prostate cancer will be reduced, another study speaks more about its increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been proven.
Mr Beaulieu further insists on the importance of discussing his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
"Submitting to an examination doesn't mean you'll have cancer."
the Higgs Boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused a justified stir last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "least wrong" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no certainty among physicists that it is a Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that closely resembles the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week at the Big Physical Congress in Kyoto rather confirms it, but all the data is still missing to give us absolute certainty.
However, suppose it is a Higgs boson, since the risks of error appear small, and let's see what it is all about.
In this world, there is an unquestionable law according to which two things cannot occur in the same place at the same time.
This rule can not be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies: the Pauli exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
Physics particles are divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently follow the Pauli principle.
And at the other end there are bosons, wicked anarchists, who value nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (absolutely amazing, by the way) which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: mesons, which we will leave unnoticed here, and the "force particles" with which the great forces of nature spread, and with which the Higgs boson is probably somehow related.
But it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic as one might think.
If you read this article, it’s thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or “particle of light,” that is the “carrier” of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this particular location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "interference" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "carriers of force".
A more stable field
It is also the case with the Higgs boson, except that it takes a different field, the Higgs field, to "disturb" it.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similar to the frozen surface of a pond, only a very large boulder will rain.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator of a part as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with accommodating beams is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Neither all particles nor all materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, for example, magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself on the refrigerator.
And equally, with the Higgs field, not all particles react: those that do have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let's look at it) don't.
And Mrs. Novak asks what all this research is for, what will it "bring to us"?
From a scientific point of view, this confirms the validity of the Standard Model (SM), allowing physicists to examine any mismatch between the observations and predictions of SM.
Moreover, not a few physicists literally want to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge flaws, does not bring any clarification of gravity (haha!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the universe's matter (again ouha!).
Until now, however, CERN has not found such contradictions.
Responses
It is difficult to predict the response of this research in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Novak, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
See: in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers at Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution their work would spark.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said this - the laser was initially considered such a "toy to the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application can also result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle did not initially plan to do so, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that one really never knows...
Palliative Care: The Best Way to Leave Life by Le Devoir
Through his Commission for the Dignity of Dying, Quebec has recently engaged in a delicate end-of-life question.
The debate is expected to continue soon, and a bill is being drafted.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this issue in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him gave him a two-year reprieve.
“They gave me five years to live, and it’s now seven,” he says on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its job: immense weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet alone or to eat alone.
He looks down on a delicious-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is courageous and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop by, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage of a simple death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it demeans me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
“Throughout life, a man learns that men urinate standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the child stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of each person" whether he accepts the return, the psychologist claims.
In the opinion of many palliative care professionals, crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "from asphyxiation while fully conscious".
Illness has allowed me to discover my children.
“I have good children,” he adds.
“I don’t have any more wishes in my life,” she says, and then she agrees to put on her breathing apparatus.
He is looking forward to his last visit to Italy in the coming days.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, nutrition care is provided in collaboration with a group of volunteers.
This is what palliative care looks like when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for every 11,700 people.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die.
Here, life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, he can be given a sip of brandy or pepsi, to taste.
Diabetics no longer need to monitor their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night they brought beer to Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of his late father.
“We help patients as well as their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care services.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, days go by, but they don't resemble each other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who rejoices in his last encounter with his family thoroughly cushioned while being toasted in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after trying every possible way to survive.
“For half a year, there are always three to five beds that are designed for people with cancer under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% come from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is intended to alleviate suffering once the sick person reaches the final stage of his or her life, whether it be at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental inaccessibility of healthcare in Quebec that has led many palliative care doctors to fear the passage of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation signed by palliative treatment leaders such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone has access to quality palliative care before euthanasia can be approved.
She says she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the E.R. in tremendous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
They are concerned that patients should not be asked to die because they are not receiving proper care.
And at the same time, many oncologists take care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
Hopes for the survival of Helene Richard were already very low when she left her demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their treating physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative cunt team eased their pain.
Palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients resist pain management in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either intermittently or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who is not relieved of pain will have greater and greater access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want you to get rid of my pain.”
This report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road administration officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists, and Italian mafia experts still tell what they know about the amazing “system” that mixes construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists, and mobsters.
This "field" came very dear to the Quebec taxpayers, especially between 1990 and 2000.
“It’s interesting how the system has become fragmented since we took the crucial measures,” says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former police chief in Montreal.
It sparked a scandal in 2011 after a thorough investigation into the embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which the then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after long delays.
The "Duchesneau Report" confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque party funding and corruption of state officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Department of Transportation has saved $1 billion on contracts," when some people have kept their instincts to get a share of them at bay!
Charbonneau’s commission has “already led two mayors to resign,” he added, hoping to “uncover the guile of some people.”
Permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The Standing Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011 is also engaged in combat with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the officers of "Marteau's retinue", who since 2009 have ensured that Montreal's "money card" significantly eased the inflation of orders...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of searches and charged a number of municipal councilors with fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one of the suburbs.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just stepped down as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian descent, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have also received formal charges.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation when he explained to the commission the mechanism of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
During those years, he donated 3% of the value of the contracts he won in Montreal to a mafia-related middleman, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
Zambia was generous to all parties after 2000 and donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money lines, the prices of which he overcharged
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very vigorously.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him in great detail before the commission: over the course of ten years, he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 from construction companies in exchange for contracts with money pipelines where he was exaggerating the price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they had been paid rewards for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through false overwork.
The mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblay of turning a blind eye to the parallel budget that was injecting dirty money into his coffers.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a widespread crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Riviere-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been campaigning since 2010 against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of all money spent in election campaigns
Of the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says, he is "pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the ants-poisoned system to stop gangrene and catch the culprits".
The process is “painful, but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we need to set up our own investigative unit in Montreal and ensure that these questionable practices cannot be undone.
It's like she's cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is especially worried about the role of "members informed of this ruse" if they have not gotten caught up in this mess!
He estimates that 70% of campaign funding in Quebec comes from dirty money, adding with irony, "I've heard it's just a weak decoction of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to $100, but that will not solve the situation, he said: “Until election spending is strictly cut, dirty money won’t disappear from politics.”
He proposes a comprehensive review of the system of awarding public contracts and party funding: "We can't go any lower; if we focus boldly on the substance of things, we can build again on a firmer foundation and with more control and compliance."
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau advises all who mock him to look in his own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into themselves, or by an entirely new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come to us.
Every day I get closer to them.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.
It's easier in matches.
In football everything is going very fast.
I am not losing my head.
From the beginning of my training at INF Clairefontaine to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved on to the individual stages.
So you're taking advantage of the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti has set up...
Back-up teams from this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every workout is essential.
And it follows that a player like me is more eager to play and wants to give maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my status.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today he has no equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He has also worked with excellent players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
I had a reassuring conversation with him in January.
I've had a lot of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you feel about the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st League, Lyon took our leading position.
But we remain in the loop.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we made it very easy to reach the finals.
What is your club’s goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we want to be a tough competitor for good European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group in front of Porto first so we can play in the rematch of the finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has it...
To become a big European club, Paris has to win titles and make history.
This is not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this happen.
Would it be a big failure to win the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had what it takes to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you are a clear champion...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it will be this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are aiming for the title, I think we have the weapons to beat them.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It’s not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what has been invested and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and there's still something in the papers that's not exactly pleasant.
You wonder what more people might want from you.
Of course, you can’t win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a play style.
It takes time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved that we can play.
Take a look at Manchester City, which did not make it to the quarterfinals for the second season, but also invested a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, you could expect to be ahead of the other 15 points!
This offends other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille, which did not do well last season, have moved on to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the 1st league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
PSG seems to rely on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's performances in everything.
It's a good thing they say there's a "golden dependency."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he scores a lot of goals.
That's what he came here to prove he's a League 1 star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
In our team, we respect both the person and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This has led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to injury, I couldn’t play as I would have liked.
But I've been there, and I've come out stronger.
Today I play good matches in the national team.
That’s what I’ve been hoping for since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to make our appearance exemplary.
How do you see the first months of Didier Deschamps leading the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good place in qualifying for the MS.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can inspire for victory.
So was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) from October 16 in Spain a solid starting game?
This game gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never seen such a match in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All the negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs among recipients.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies is leading to financial crises.
Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), features both virtual money (convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure BitTorrent-like conversion protocol that allows file exchange between pairs of partners.
With 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About 1,000 websites are already accepting bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin’s exchange rate first peaked at $30 ($23) in June 2011, then dropped to $2 five months later, now hovering at around $10 (see bitcoincharts.com for an overview of the exchange rates).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is not impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was published in October.
Bitcoin has been described as “the most successful virtual money”, “competing the dollar and the euro” and “the equivalent of ordinary money”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like “credits” used for progressing in a video game that a person acquires in a game or that he can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Every month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are book depositories of current accounts, controllers, issuers of money, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
Thus, the network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key stage is to write this new transaction into this book.
It is done by solving a mathematical task given to computers, whose solver, a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is the cutting-out phase of a file; that is, the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers "take" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then "slash" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then appear indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wanted to pay twice the same money for the purpose of fraud very quickly (within ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each of them has a different fingerprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this remuneration is regularly divided by two, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they can be divided into one hundred millionths, so there is room for margin.
The difficulty of the specified task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been hacked and stolen bitcoins stored there.
“The loophole used is not about the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Prominent players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the ledger of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "huge discounts" were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a Bitcoin-to-Gold company.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions, which makes them cheaper.
In addition, the bearer manages his/her identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up with traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just give an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by the phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and move towards more horizontal systems.
“Bitcoin will take a while to establish itself, but 2013 could be a decisive year,” he said.
Moreover, the ECB’s report envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
French troops have abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside suffered the most damage, which we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And so do we, for we have lost 88 soldiers killed, and what about all those wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent aid from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the foundations of Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, went well.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by air escort helicopters.
By the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable progress in 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the land was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different resistance groups.
Their taking control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants, which was completely controlled by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved until our time.
The former mujahedeen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
Major dignitaries from the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seizing state lands that they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and using huge US subcontracting contracts.
They have discredited themselves; most of them, moreover, have never even been in combat.
From what I've heard in campaigns, people want a government that isn't made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, just as those who have been able to take advantage of America’s generosity will leave: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young are tired of war and the associated ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they got to know the modern world and were intrigued by its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul currently has a population of 5 million, a fifth of the total population.
There are public schools in the city, with boys and girls.
These young people will have to be provided with work, they no longer want to return to the obscurantism of former parties or the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; they watch TV and Turkish series that show the modern world everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that take the lead be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the struggle against the Soviet army are already restoring provincial militias that will be out of control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity, should enjoy a degree of decentralization along the lines of Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the April 2014 elections.
The country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam is working, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has a huge mineral wealth.
And that only gave rise to the feeling that the Western states were only there to seize it.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without the resources to transport raw materials across mountains, however, no mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeological teams (supported by the World Bank) with the opportunity to explore the sprawling Buddhist compound to retain their role as the most prominent employer in the entire province.
One day Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large proportion of imports and exports depend, will also need to resume normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of the common types of assistance: girls and boys lyceum, French departments at universities, French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the “gaining heart and soul” initiative has been working to try to reconcile aid and military activities, with the “civil-military action” service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but has achieved a number of successes in the field of common interest and steps for agricultural renewal in dozens of mountain villages thanks to a small French NGO.
These works, involving a large number of local workers, helped to dampen the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and the expansion of cultivated land.
What memory do we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often located at altitudes above 2,000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, these farmers wish, in their words, to obtain tiny civil aid in their favor, which would be properly controlled and directly affect them.
Difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohamed Morsi is playing another round of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the promulgation of a constitution temporarily granting it unlimited powers, it decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, regardless of everyone else's opinion, he announced that the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text the next day.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has used a provisional text that has been amended many times, which weakens the country's constitutional stability and leads to legal conjecture.
This new initiative only further strengthened the country's ambivalence.
From the opposition's point of view, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium", continues to "break his word" and "steps the law".
But his supporters say it is a means to tackle the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum will be held in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to clarify the article by article.
It is also a way for the president to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while protests are raging across the country.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems confident that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially because this hastily organised vote puts the Egyptian people before an ultimatum: 'You will either approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers', which should otherwise come to an end when the new constitution is approved.
And in this strange atmosphere, yesterday 85 deputies of the above-mentioned Constituent Assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the declaration of the constitution, they slammed the door, saying they had no opportunity to assert their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have imitated their step.
In order to reach a quorum, 11 alternates were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators further paused on the fact that one of the few controversies that day revolved around... hours of prayer, when some members of the committee held the view that the hours in the boardroom were not properly arranged.
The text that was voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution, stating that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the crucial requirements, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that the article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," objected the liberals, who see it only as a rhetorical problem.
Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers an advisory role on al-Azhar University, in particular for issues of checking the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "persons called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This is the beginning of a theocracy.”
Liberals are even more alarmed by the fact that the university’s next rector should be less moderate than the current one.
"So far, there has been no concrete religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulamas, but university workers, many of whom have graduated from French schools," Alexis Blouet, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt, said in a statement.
However, he agrees that "there may be discrepancies over the interpretation of Article 220 because the terms used in it belong to a religious dictionary.
There is especially a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question may arise of the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment on this.”
The text approved yesterday is highly criticized in addition to religious sites because of the extended powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that they have been severely curtailed compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: powers vested in the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the military, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
Furthermore, civilian trials will not be prohibited in military courts, as requested by the human rights association.
These associations speak of their doubts in connection with the text, which they believe is directed against freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, Human Rights Watch’s Heba Morayef points out.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to make a televised speech last night, rallies are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel waiting for Ukrainian tourists holy places, the navel of the world and the sea from saturated salt solution
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of biblical truth, modern comfort, and unspoiled nature.
AaF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Adoration of the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that God’s mercy will descend upon all who enter this “bath.”
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers will pass through the Way of Pain, or the Way of Jesus of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the judgment was held, passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha - the place of crucifixion, the stone of the anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made a cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a trip around the vertical
The ruins of Masada remained hidden from the enemy that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 BC.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are involved in mountaineering can reach it.
Others will take the cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus transports tourists to this ski paradise from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can’t visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
In his exhibition are widely represented impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Spa Museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figurines of bath users and spa attendants from that time.
In Caesarea, the unique private Ralli Museum is worth a visit, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Rodeno.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You step inside - and you find yourself in total darkness.
The stars twinkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also included.
Improve your health
Israel’s three main spa resorts are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea you can bathe even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even hotter, and people bathe in it all year round.
By the way, the Dead Sea is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest point on the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
Cyan water in it is a saturated saline solution that easily keeps even people who can not swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Head here to undergo treatment using brine, and medicinal mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to heal your ragged nerves.
Touch the Mysterious Past
It is protected by an ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them passed the famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they then lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love wandering through the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you cling to the walls in the alley "your" sign, happiness will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their pictures taken.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully renovated theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For the journey, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now $1 is approximately 3.8 shekels).
Buses are mainly used for public transport, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city with the upper one.
Basically, it's an underground cableway.
Travelling by all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Shabbat is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, you stop working in markets, shops and public transport.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you will only get kosher dishes: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat combinations are included.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts made from coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus, various kinds of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many fat cats who are gracefully "wandering according to their taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Ahead cats love crowded places and are eager to embark on any goodies.
Renting a car will cost between $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 a day (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - 15 dollars a day.
And renting a bike will cost around 15 shekels per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed by numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To get to know the country and relax came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The Promised Land was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Big and mighty" announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While lawmakers and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling "counterfeit" certificates
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to pass a Russian language test.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sectors.
However, the FMS promises that, over time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Language skills will also need to be validated to obtain and extend a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is not subject to people who successfully achieved attestation and obtained an academic diploma until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Usefulness, Conviction and Protection of Rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; already today, more than 160 such centers are open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by members of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to put the question in the press many times: and what will it actually bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all - according to representatives of the migration service - this will make it possible to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "slavery work."
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, Chairman of the Board of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan.
Their rights should be protected before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will allow 90% of the problems of foreign workers to be solved.
Problems arise with emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language, he says, the future migrant is doomed to clash with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "voucher" to the horrible, tight lodgings in which he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food and documents and toil for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their homeland, they promise them one thing, but when they arrive, they are tricked, their passports are confiscated, they do not pay the promised wages," said Tolib Sharipov, head of the Main Tajik Labour Migration Administration.
Don't swear!
All the more so since many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get to, but do not even have experience with the given job.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as it is their misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, put on and equipped for school.
As children reach working age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without the knowledge of the language, it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, with regard to the Law on Language Examinations, human rights defenders point to one important point.
Testing will only be carried out on migrants with legal status.
If they don't, they won't take exams or get any more official jobs.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers are living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized Entry"
Many of the incoming workers claim that obtaining official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalization, in addition, costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that we have basically fake documents, without registration, and there are extortion cases.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - shared with journalists his experience citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khushkadamov.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the law on language, it was found that fake documents were not just for migrants to register.
The FMS staff has already seized several false certificates of passing the language exam.
Counterfeit documents are printed on an ordinary color printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, hoping to ease the problem of passing tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more than passing the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is thus to secure the system from corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Meanwhile, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed the test for the first time the time they need to complete a course on the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active interaction with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposes to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of the authorities to recent events: the instigation of the shootings at weddings, which were carried out without victims, and the massacre prepared by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age from 18 to 21.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who has promised that amendments to the gun law will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem through the way of "tightening the screws".
An open letter appeared in the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand a rejection of the "unreasonable tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist, said in an interview with the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior were committed in six months in 2012, while a total of 1168,000 crimes were committed in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of civil arms legislation will not force the perpetrators to switch to the "black" market.
According to them, at present, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and General Staff workplaces.
Screenshot of sites that accept gun orders
The first - "military or military way", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The guns were stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranec said.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals in the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement employees.
Illegal "mainly" goes on sale from military warehouses.
Explosions often occur in many military warehouses.
"It's been proven that some of the fires were set deliberately - to cover the gap," the former soldier says.
According to Barance, they also bring their contribution to the arms manufacturers.
“At the moment, private arms companies are emerging that are not competitive on the international market and are eliminating the weapons they supply to the black market, including Moscow,” he said.
Another source of "black market" is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and automata come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced in small-scale production, and a mafia was created that organized their smooth production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of individual sources of illegal weapons supply in the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, come from military and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons found themselves on the black market "due to the fault of officials whose work is linked to weapons," the report said.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there was a theft of weapons in their manufacture, 5% is "black archaeology".
A salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archeologists" no longer buy - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, sellers go directly to military warehouses for new shipments.
An ensign buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him, he'll sell it to you over the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells it there for 900 euros a piece with two magazines," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, so whenever their crime-clarification plan catches fire, they make a check purchase from illegal arms dealers," the adviser added.
"Like in a luxury store"
Sellers and buyers most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I used to visit websites and blogs until a guy came along who offered me the opportunity to switch to the “Test” platform, where there would be a man who would lead me to the “corner” where we would negotiate.
I found out the price there.
Military correspondent Viktor Baranec
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the salesman-advisor.- I have such a friend, but I do not fully trust him.
There are sellers on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that my daughter lost a tooth."
And now I'm gonna get there through a man I'm sure of.
He will deliver them only to me, because he knows that I will not give it to him.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was working on a paper on this topic.
The schematics, according to his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album that said "everything you could think of".
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
To the buyer, in the words of Baraněc, they do not offer a hare in a sack - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller into the woods and we build a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and if I make sure the gun shoots well, we start to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Tray on the sofa
Search engines will bring you to websites and groups on "Vkontakt", where it is offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents or face-to-face meetings are required.
"Just have a set amount of money," they write in the ad headline on the website "Buy a Combat Gun or an Automaton".
On these pages, users leave their announcements and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course, without a license," asks user "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"Buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently thrown away a vast network of front-page websites, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can rake in a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish to the bait and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military correspondent and senior military officer Viktor Baranec
I’ve heard of schemes like this: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment via an ATM.
"In response, the seller will send him a photograph and a description of where the gun is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO "Right to the Gun."
Viktor Baranec confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can remain unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate that you will pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Right to a Gun", you will get a Makarov pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to a month and a half.
The weapon is dispatched from the warehouses for long-term storage through the middle cell warehouses.
According to the official statistical office, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7% compared to the period January - October 2011, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, workers of fast food and supermarkets are on strike
Up to a quarter of all U.S. teenagers go to work at McDonald’s.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in America against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
The whole event is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the modest salary increases received by grassroots workers at Walmart and in fast food systems, the goal of the protest organizers is to achieve a formation in them in their trade union organizations.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called “Black Friday,” when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, engulfed millions of people and, in some cases, was accompanied by brawls.
On this day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated with trade unions and left-wing activists from multinational retail chains whose goods are targeted at the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
On average, products in its stores are 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage employees at Walmart only shop with themselves at work.
The availability and range of goods have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply, partly because it pays little to its employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or hand-held scanners.
Protesters on "Black Friday" demanded pay increases, complaining that the cost of health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn’t match the cost, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
This is an average of 1.1% more than the company is spending on salaries now.
If Walmart moves wage increases fully to the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart’s defense attorneys say the protest has only been held in nine countries and should cause virtually no damage to the company.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday night until midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cashiers made nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
In an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post website, company representative Dan Fogelman said that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had left the jobs, and that the protest was "another media sensation" organized by the union.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
Protests continued this week in New York City, where their destination was not Walmart department stores (those in that progressive city are not very popular and therefore almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, then doesn't even pay you sick pay and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage for work is $7.25 per hour, according to federal and New York state regulations.
Fast food restaurants are gradually raising this wage, but only slightly, and on average, their regular workers in New York are getting $8.90 per hour.
No one has a lower salary in this expensive city.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter after school part-time and live with their parents get a job at McDonald’s.
Few people see it as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
At present, I constantly meet in conversation with the workers of the "McDonald", who complain that they have to live on this money and sometimes even feed their children from it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don’t know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday near "McDonald" at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs at fast food establishments begin receiving at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be set up in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing the establishment of trade unions and punishing trade union activists with bullying and layoffs.
Management, on the other hand, rarely makes their lives easier.
However, the introduction of trade unions in fast food establishments is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high turnover of employees.
Disagree
On this day, noisy protests also took place in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The climax of the event was a midday rally at "McDonald's" near Times Square, featuring several local Democratic politicians, most notably city council member Jumaane Williams, who said "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, then doesn't even pay you sick pay and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!"
Demonstrators have also received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must stand together to support the fast food workers to achieve the fair pay for their work and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people attended, though not all of them were fast-food workers, employing tens of thousands of people in New York City.
Whether this event will become the spark that ignites the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain has managed to deceive mediocrely"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies, a popular topic is augmented reality; more recently, it means perceiving the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier this summer, at its annual conference, Google showcased a working model of this innovation, and in November, it was announced that Microsoft had also filed for the patent.
An interview with the head of a group of interactive 3D technologies at Microsoft’s Cambridge laboratory, Sharam Izadi, shows that glasses are a thing of the past for the company’s scientists.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
Please tell us what your research group is doing.
- We deal with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has been stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect sensors, because the ability to control with gestures is very interesting for everyone.
- What else is there in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, very many interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but the output flow is not yet particularly.
We are trying to change that, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- Surely it can not be considered a panacea - a question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not bloated, just such sloppy, short ones.
Gestures would not be taken with the camera of the device, but with a bracelet that would track the movements of bones and muscles.
So far it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very difficult to tell.
- So you want to get the users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot at the moment?
- That's not necessary, but it's a rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't resolution, depth, or something else enough today?
- Basically, the current generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
At the same time, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this allocates work to the designers of algorithms.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So the speed, the number of frames per second, is also very important.
Human movement is fairly dynamic, and the current data rates of 30 frames per second are frankly a bit low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond has made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with current, mass-produced sensors being closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
For me at work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just do not need so many touches, but I need some extra frames per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- Three "cameras" are now used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera - it's actually a common visible-band sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations performed.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, play around with the camera’s curvature, and see how this will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present their glasses.
Don’t you think that when it comes to the everyday use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, it’s one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course walking and constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be a "portable" form of reality expansion, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to a smartphone, projection display and more.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, this is their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time also weakness - augmented reality on the basis of glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
The hands feel nothing!
What are the answers your group is preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a kind of substrate for imaging.
Excellent way records compression!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding palpability to these "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located, evokes a tactile sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on the tummy of your fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at a given moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking through an open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country tracks (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If deceiving the brain becomes a goal, then the work is still for many years to come.
That's what makes virtual reality work so appealing to researchers - many things are in their infancy.
Vkusovsky instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already prominent figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe, without achieving all-Russian renown.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is dressed all in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here at the fashion pubs and at the openings.
The paintings of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical storytellers of St. Petersburg, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is the conspicuous man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being an urban person, his appearance on the streets raises a smile on the face of citizens, raises everyone's mood.
He recently picked up a bottlette and became a St. Petersburg bottle maker, as he matured into this complex role with his entire bohemian life, philosophy, and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking around in red and not yellow or turquoise?
- I chose the red color as a designer dealing with looks and image.
In this world, red represents a compromise between the artist, the image maker, and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that is slightly different from gray, it arouses aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at establishing a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is above all an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
At that time, a wave of old free unofficial artists had passed, and I could not understand the new, free types of artists.
I befriended the new wave artists, the post-Gazonnevs, who brought us to "Pushkin 10," and there were no more waves.
It attracts me to theater, dressing, music, to all genres except the word.
- And it all merged in your art-clinic ...- For me it was important to find myself at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should gather.
In 1995, I took a seat at Pushkinska 10, and before the reconstruction there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, the home of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
There was born a lot: NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how Šnura brought with the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
Both Šnur and his friends sang light songs under plywood, dressed in tight-fitting leotards, among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, which started his great career, basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the reverberation of Art Clinic.
This is where our working and regular guests went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, a survey was arranged to be in the press, the special prize was "People in Our City".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination, I was named, thus ending my peak.
In the new times under the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In recent years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are distinctive in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which topicality and sharpness are vividly captured.
I'm going to have the program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, now being so is painful and terrible.
But in clowns everything is wiped away, the tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by means of totalitarian disguise in the regulation order.
Today, people meet according to clothes, they focus on external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
- We saw you recently in the role of a city flask.
Who would he be if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial, utility art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are falling apart.
In the past, people used to meet in clusters, bohemians loved one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken down into micro-companies, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everyone.
Today you need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand spectators will come to Stas Mikhailov!
It's where the fans come in. It's where the sexual social sphere gets involved.
And 300 people come to cultural land, and 10,000 don't come, and the result is less management, less money, less everything.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one deceives them and does not violate what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that hung on a wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that people usually end with.
Nowadays, people often confuse concepts.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There's no consumer culture, that's from somewhere else.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money because of drawing pictures.
I am for that culture.
- Cyril, what's the shortage in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an official through culture.
However, not everyone is interested in culture.
In the days of the proper tsar, this was not the case in everything, the tsar may not have understood the culture very much, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
Here in St. Petersburg we have people who could be experts, but they are tucked somewhere in the corner, because there is a need for great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
Today, taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but different in that they sincerely say that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petersburg is?
- Petersburg - this is not the capital of culture, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is the right soil.
And on our eel, art thrives miserably.
We need the cultural soil, but there are more writers than readers in our country today, that's wrong.
In Europe there are very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
With us, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashionable thing, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by the St. Petersburg grant
Birth in Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with earthlings on board embark on a journey in search of a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your genus in weightlessness conditions or on a given replacement planet?
I don't think the choice is too big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Sternberg.
However, while there are better conditions for life on Mars, the temperature on Venus is 500 degrees Celsius.
It is possible to live there only at a great height or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the issue of reproduction in space began scientists with flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments on plants were carried out.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
After that, the insects were carried into orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to check how an embryo develops in a weightless state.
At the exit we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with this bird having to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) of the RAN.
If they do not find support, the birds fall chaotically and make somersaults.
After 10 hours, the freshly hatched birds had a complete extinction of their instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the problem was, they just died within four days.
“We’ve had the birds hatch twice, but then we refused because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” Sychev said.
The last "miniarch" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
But in the biosatellite "Bion" there will only be beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already pregnant.
In fact, they found nothing supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, the space rats gave birth to offspring.
However, it has not been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult task.
Animals, losing the usual environment, simply can not realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, humans can, in principle.
Homo sapiens dominates abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, no such experiments are carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest danger was Tereshkova.
The most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could tell whether it would last into space.
Whether he can give birth to a child after such a flight.
“No one has answered this question yet,” said Vachtang Vačnadze, a veteran of the space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after her flight into space, she gave birth to her first daughter, Valentina Tereshkova.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in open space, was born.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few astronauts who have had healthy offspring after many years.
“In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital flights,” said Valery Polyakov, a Soviet Union Hero and Russian Hero.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new paths in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here in zero-attractive conditions, astronauts adopt the habits needed to work in open space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
Although for adults water is a comfortable but strange environment, for young children it is a natural element.
Little ichtians seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the baby is in the mother's amniotic fluid for an average of 9 months and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
“That’s too little for a child to forget,” says swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn baby, then gravity, an attractive force, is more natural for women.
In weightlessness, there is a very rapid wasting of the abdominal muscles, the pelvic muscles, the ability of the body to expel the fetus decreases.
We can put this aside if muscle stimulators work during childbirth.
After all, it is possible for childbirth to take place in a special chamber, in which the organism of the mother expels the fetus.
"What next?" asks Valery Polyakov difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the body is not affected by gravity, it cannot properly form a skeleton or a muscle system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a load in which to train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs for his development.
"If we go with you into an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unadapted to the environment," Igor Pestov, head of the IBMP RAN bioethics commission, said in a statement.
So the birth of children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
But there will come a time when it will become a reality, and when the earthlings will set out in their arks to a faraway planet that will become the home of their space-born descendants.
SAO chief: Control of the Swiss system failed due to politicians
The Czech Republic has good auditors and good legislation in connection with public contracts, but it lags behind in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Audit Office, says so.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what I think is missing in our country," Kala said.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of bad practice, he cites the approach of Petr Nečas to the so-called "švarcsystem".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with its controls - is it banned or allowed?
"The law must be set up somehow, and if it bans something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the office, which has the obligation to go to check and enforce obligations," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was that about?
It's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, the European legislation regulates how public procurement is handled, followed by individual national legislation and then by the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the inspection is not yet finished, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is perhaps "more stringent and perfect", however, the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to devote oneself to the application of law itself.
What can this project do for you, what does it mean for you?
It is such joint control that could help us to stop trying to refine laws, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But by lowering the order limit, we don’t necessarily achieve that.
Maybe the system will become overwhelmed by so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw from it much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, just as the SAO operates there the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised similarly to us, also has a college, only it is formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities proceed similarly.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, it also has these accounting courts at the level of individual federal states - in this the system differs a little from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, represented in our country by state means.
Public funds, which are administered by our regions and municipalities, are controlled there from the level of the Federal Courts of Auditors.
As far as the legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, however, in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it can not be said that it is better in everything.
Is it because they have better controls?
Certainly not, but again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even countries that we consider to be role models face a number of problems.
Otherwise, it would be of no benefit to them to cooperate with our office, would it?
As for the domestic legislation, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean for your office, are its impacts already being reflected in any way?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet reflected in our control actions.
Because we do ex-post checks, we need to anticipate a certain delay.
So far, we are only observing this in the process of preparing future inspections - we have started our new tool "risk detection of inefficiency", through which we have swept almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analyzed them - there, of course, the changes will be reflected, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted, and so on.
Do you consider the approval of this law to be a benefit or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that the rules will be "tightened" and it will not be possible to comply with them.
Already under the operation of the previous rules, the audited persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, by the regional council) that any failure to comply with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth tightening the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only put more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road leads.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with checks on the so-called "svarcsystem" - and what does this mean?
Is the Švarcsystem banned or allowed?
The law must be set up somehow, and if it bans something, then even the Prime Minister can not prevent the operation of the office, which is obliged to go to check and enforce obligations.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow it," but he can't say that we're going to act like nothing.
There are quite strict rules in the Public Procurement Act on what is to be formally done - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be right - that is what I think is missing in us.
Roads are frozen in places, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads are icy and snowy.
But usually the roads are passable, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region, the roads were passable this morning, but in some places they were frozen and also snowy.
The temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm slightly during the day.
The snow in the region has stopped and there is only a weak layer in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
In some places, visibility was also lower due to fog, according to data from the dispatching centre of regional roadmen.
R6 expressways and first-class roads are now unobstructed in the region.
However, caution is needed on some bridges, where the surface may be frosty and slippery.
All second- and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
In some areas, however, there are still leftovers of frozen and sometimes driven snow.
Especially in high altitudes, you need to pay more attention to driving.
Pardubický and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of frost, in higher altitudes and in the mountains there may be a layer of snow on the roads, reports the Directorate of Roads and Highways on its website.
Roadmen warn the driver against icing, it can form especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice Region.
The ice can be in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, especially on roads of second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitavy.
Snow is mainly on roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kneznou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today it is mostly clear to partly cloudy with no precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a weak wind blows.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Plzeň region are passable this morning, but in some places with increased caution and driving need to adapt to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, temperatures vary between three and nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frostbite.
Drivers must also expect fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to the information of the Regional Road Traffic Control.
The D5 motorway is almost unobstructed, but increased caution is recommended for road managers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
However, there may be frosty sections in the southern Pilsen and Tachov regions.
Second- and third-class communications are damp, and even in this case, the warning applies to frozen sections.
Drivers should be especially careful on less frequented roads in the Šumava region.
The Olomouc Region
Today, drivers heading to the highest locations of the Olomouc Region have to count on snow mash on the road.
After the chemical sprinkles, it remained on the Červenohorské sedlo and on the way to the Videlský Cross.
Roadmen were driven into the terrain by snow at night, and in the Šumperk region they snowed about three centimeters, according to road administrators.
In other parts of the country, roads are mostly passable without restrictions.
"In the Šumperk region, there is snow in the highest positions.
Drivers must count on the snow mash on Červenohorské sedlo in the direction of Jeseník," the dispatcher of the Šumperk road administration told the Czech News Agency today.
Their colleagues in Jeseník also set off into the field at night, and the roads up to the highest positions are now bare and wet after chemical treatment, according to them.
In the Olomouc region, the roads are passable without restrictions, but in the Šternberk region, drivers should be careful in forest sections where the roads have remained wet.
Ústí Region, Liberec Region
Several difficult-to-drive places are reported this morning by roadmen in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with snow or glaciers, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice to Ústí is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are also kept below zero in lower elevations, so ice and snow are likely to last on the roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of České středohoří, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported by roadmen especially from the surroundings of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, at night conditions were ideal for her - rain during the day and melting snow, at night clear and frost.
Adverse conditions are also reported from the main roads on the I/13 road on the border of the Ústí and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by bent branches of trees that bent to the roadway under the snow.
Šimon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we humans like to catch up on.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also organize a completely unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to readers?
It's a national fundraiser we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, 20 December at 9 pm, 3 concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to amassing enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, we also want to reflect with the public on the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of items shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing on www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other artists, also performed the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancelled".
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, that is, if we succeed and the world does not end...
It will be sung by all the performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems are also connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
He wrote the words to this song and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, in it he also sings Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are working hard to get them involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What will the proceeds of the concerts go to against the end of the world?
On the equipment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in Jedlička Institute.
The students of Jedlička Institute are regularly attended by lecturers and are engaged in activities that they enjoy and are interested in.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers themselves, so we try to allow them to do so in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We tried to create a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “bombs” in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, while we are in the USA, would like to connect this with the performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these routes logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on an electric wheelchair, its trolleys must travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we carry a large amount of cargo and tool boxes with us...
However, so far it has always been done without any problems, ČSA and British Airways were well prepared for us, that I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how different they are in terms of accessibility, public access to the disabled, and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than here, we have just seen in Russia that everything is still in its infancy in the East.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-free, here it is still unusual for a person in an electric wheelchair to move alone in the city center.
There is no such thing as a chairlift in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil associations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And where do we still have to catch up with more advanced countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind on...
However, it is important to note that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to take an active part in social life, on the contrary, we are a little ahead of The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or being barrier-free is one thing, but it’s only when we become great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers that things really start to change.
So far, these are rare cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I started as an educator at Jedlička Institute, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play the saxophone, among other things, so together with a colleague I founded an interest music club.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But the popularity has come only in recent years, am I wrong?
It was true that it helped us when we started connecting with well-known singers and also actively working on promoting the band.
We realized that work that is not visible, basically, as if it did not exist.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can also afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal with The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is crowded with things where one mimics the other.
It is logical in a way, everything new is taken with care and it takes a long time.
Things that are rare are very few, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person seeing us for the first time is, of course, regret, it's natural...
But that regret is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary resources to do so.
I say that when people with disabilities succeed, it is not just a shift for them, but for the whole society.
Has being a strict boss, as many people have called you, also helped this success?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require a certain discipline.
I mean, that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and a head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend rehearsals, and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, then the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them started in 1998?
There is only one Angel.
We are an open group, people are leaving and coming, there is no way to prevent that.
Who has the will and taste, always has the door open to us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 pm
Incheba arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynojem will take place in Prague with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will connect by telebridge while singing the song of the band The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for equipping the multifunctional barrier-free educational centre STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million.
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years have free tickets in the Bohemiaticket presale
Poland and the Cosmos.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency at the European Space Agency’s Ministerial Meeting, the second country from the former Eastern Bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the following years participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
But Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Before World War II, Polish enthusiasts had been involved in spaceflight; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on 6 December 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Entering Space.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prizes for Entering Space in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of cosmonautics, and his contribution was also appreciated for the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railcar was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is also not clear whether the rocket should have been used to start or brake the train.
Information about this dressage is known only from the period press.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has been engaged in missile operations.
The research was provided by Komórka Techniki Armaments in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the surviving materials that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, research was interrupted.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozinski, appeared in the professional press, and in the following year the work of Rakiet - torpedo powietrzna and rakietobomb lotnicza by the author Leliwy-Krzywoblocký was published.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) devoted itself to all projects of military use of missile technology, coordinating all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ended with the start of the war.
Further work on space appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, which includes four more comprehensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with space.
At that time, projects of artificial satellites were already underway, and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded 1951), and already in the autumn the PTA became a full member.
And in the following year, the first chairman of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became the deputy chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has significantly contributed to the development of the very successful RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) weather rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with an altitude of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were launched in the Bled Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next development was supposed to be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have a range of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
In 1962, however, further development was suspended.
The first RM rocket was the Meteor-1, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B, and -1C) were developed, differing in size of space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket was available space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Institute of Aeronautics developed the Meteor-2 rocket, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 had a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland joined the Committee for Space Research in 1960 and formed a national committee two years later.
Poland also became involved in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalized world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic formations, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in labour price, (wage) there is a price tension.
This is to be understood as a situation in which a producer seeks to compete by "undercutting" the price of a competitor by importing cheap goods in order to take a larger share of the market and thereby increase its profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production abroad, or to buy cheaply there, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The situation is aggravated by the absolute unwillingness of businessmen to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
The ruthless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where the governments of individual countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments risk their own populations for private capital, regardless of social decline.
This is mainly reflected in the changes to existing laws.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the price dictate of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done both by a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and by restricting workers' rights in the area of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with an increase in the gap between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been for many years public food dispensers for the poor who cannot make a living by their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
As part of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for well-employed people to receive such a wage that the state has to pay them to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also made public in the case of auxiliary employees of the Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people, under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in the social level, are forced to either emigrate as it was in the 19th century or to live on hunger wages on the margins of society in the hope that perhaps private investment capital will one day come to the country.
But the question is where does it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turkish, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media argue that the state cannot capitalize on its own economy, that a managed economy leads to economic disaster.
The private equity firm insists that the state must not intervene in the economy by controlling interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, now it actually directs politics and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
The obvious answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation where practically everything is reprehensible but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that the state ministries for lack of funds commission the drafting of draft laws to private law firms, which are mostly connected with industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as the constitutions of the Western type proclaim, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly coming into the situation described by Appianus in his Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete disarray and the authorities have occupied themselves by force.
For bribes, unlawful favors, and using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were rampant, and the people went to the polls with a pre-sold voice"... "characteristic people did not apply for office at all, so once as a result of this disruption the state was eight months without consuls"..... "It began to be said that the only cure in a bad situation was self-government, which had to be elected by an energetic man."
Conclusion As in ancient times, contemporary society is based on a ruthless preference for self-benefit, regardless of society-wide interest.
Private capital, by its very nature, is no longer capable of understanding and applying the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any attempt at deeper reforms.
The causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state, the demise of these systems in favor of liberal-type democracy can be considered as a kind of break with the expectation of the next round.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the present elites completely ignore the possible hundreds of thousands of lives lost in the future, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing along with crimes against humanity, as we know them from old and new history.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and the European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms that will strengthen the state’s capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: A Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and never can" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be no" by the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there has been a lot of reaction.
Some stand for Israel, argue for its right to self-defense, and the Palestinians are categorized as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide of Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is categorized as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the periodically recurring waves of killing and who is the victim, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
The point is to offer readers a behind-the-scenes look, a look at who has been primarily served by the 95-year-long tension (counted since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my reflections are supported by available historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find one Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who guided their steps completely autonomously or whether there was someone behind their throne who guided their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live at a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have taken place in the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands one who might consider herself the head of an octopus (whether or not someone still stands above them I do not know, but I do not exclude it) - the Rothschilds.
They don't say much about them.
Of course.
They bought their first press agency (Reuters) back in the 1890s to stop associating their name with the highly criminal acts they stood behind, which always meant consolidating power, increasing wealth, or both.
They have major holdings in almost all of the world’s central banks, and against countries where central bank holdings are not being fought or prepared for wars (there were seven countries before the invasion of Afghanistan, five after the invasion of Iraq, only four after the overthrow of Gaddafi, but Russia has in the meantime subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore Rothschild's Bank of America to central bank status, began issuing his own (meaning government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing its own money and wanted to abolish the FED, was assassinated 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for unleashing the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859-1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars by the Mason of the highest, 33rd degree consecration Albert Pike.
The first was to abolish the great monarchist states of Europe, the second was to abolish the colonial rule of Britain in particular, and the third was to reduce the world population to somewhere between 0.5 and 1 billion people (such an amount of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and they do not consume so many resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a forefield for such a solution) and the final assumption of absolute power.
The method a group of the wealthiest families, headed by Rothschields, works is to initiate a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao).
But these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so as not to repeat crises like the one they provoked in 1907).
Thus, after the assassination of the Habsburg successor to the R-U throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo unleashed the First World War, they destroyed tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (no longer needed for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and the subsequent fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria Hungary.
To facilitate the start of World War II, the bankers let politicians create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thus creating a precondition for radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then they just had to foist on the Germans a sufficiently strong, guilty and simple solution offering the Fuhrer, and then by creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was also supposed to play a role.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds encouraged the establishment of the Zionist Movement, whose one branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferentially in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour Declaration created the precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out, whether Hitler broke the chain on which the international bankers initially held him, or whatever he did was hard to guess, anyway the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the precondition for acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and as war reparations to Germany were aimed at World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created a third outbreak of war.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in the second, will be the victims of the frontline struggles, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country but also internationally (let’s just consider how sharply the people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only give people their own candidates to vote for.
Netanyahu, Israel’s current prime minister, is a typical example of a fascist, international banker loyal to him, a politician who is doing everything he can to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran’s control of the Strait of Hormuz, which travels only 20% of the world’s oil lane.
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The New World Order in their imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comforts of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
"And he compels all small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that he may not buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of his name.
This must be understood: whoever has reason, let him add up the digits of the beast.
That number is a man, and that number is six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When things get tough, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlavi, who fled to the US after the revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive starting point - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as it would fundamentally threaten the confidence of allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages was not possible in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later exacerbated by a failure to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were eventually released after 444 days of negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
The debate in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film, directed by Ben Affleck Argo, describes one episode of that history that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees escaped from it.
They ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of the film crew, which in the country surveyed locations for the shooting of science fiction large-scale film.
Combinations of genres
The plan, devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend credible, the film project was reported in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a strange combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, a set-up - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
The film thus alternates moods - on the one hand documentary sequences from Tehran (in the title sequence are shown iconic contemporary photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were shown in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, light passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and slight exaggeration.
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable career restart.
The derided actor became a respected director, and even his acting ceased to be the subject of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime film Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The City (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film not to take place in the director's home Boston.
The atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that elevated the director’s older films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Argos, where Tehran “plays” Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, reconstructing real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys the emotion of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere out of the blue.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake crew at a Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the narrated story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of thrilling scenes.
He works quite successfully with it, sometimes he makes up his mind about reality - everything is not so elegant there anymore (the scene in which the impending crisis at Tehran airport is averted by a phone call in America and the chase on the runway seems quite far-fetched).
The weakness of Argos, however, is the distraction of having to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film is losing some of its dramatic thrust; it is a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciated for its realization and the retro style evoking the thrillers of the 1970s.
It's hard to pull.
As a reminder of one still living history, and a proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipotent and omniscient secret services are, it will suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The site www.bankovni feeky.com, which annually launches a survey about the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to launch a competition for "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU".
"We were led to this by the last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the poll.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court to unify the premium rates for men and women.
So far, women have been favoured in the price of life insurance policies because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
The controversial EU regulations include mandatory incorporation of biofuels into fuels, which is detrimental to nature, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or a directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
Criticism had previously also faced a de facto ban on the use of the term spread butter or the exclusion of incandescent bulbs from sale.
Good quality bananas should be 14 centimeters
The EU apparatus often makes decisions under the pressure of one or another business or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (so the Czech Republic is now also enforcing the demands of its banks with the threat of a veto).
The lobby's interests were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to be at least 14 cm long in the Union and were not allowed to show "anomalous curvature".
The European Commission has defended itself by harmonising existing inconsistent national standards that have complicated trade.
Despite opposition from some countries, the EU has already softened the fruit and vegetable standards, pointing out that the existing directives lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in the poll may also be last year's EU regulation, according to which it must be mandatory for the inflatable balloons sold to be warned that children under 8 years of age must not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has cited U.S. research that says balloons are the leading cause of death among children from choking.
Similar restrictions now apply to children up to the age of 14 when blowing in fairgrounds.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule concerning European officials themselves is also quite absurd - everyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia for Greece due to the sensitivity of the topic and must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead.
In addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities, the Bank Fees.com server in cooperation with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Faire, has also nominated an EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set maximum volumes of food stocks that may have been located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volumes for canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the poll were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies on request for subsidies.
These ideas, however, did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped because we don't have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was produced in our country and as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state should have full warehouses, which he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for having the Czech Republic further to the ports.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy was offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development managed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically to go to write a request for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While regulations are easy to criticise in the Member States, EU efforts to regulate and, at the same time, to make the whole Union work more efficiently and develop deserve recognition, according to a number of experts.
For example, EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which were forced by Member States in budgetary negotiations, are a more serious problem, according to experts.
Emotion among Czechs is also aroused by the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to specific designation of its traditional products, and it does not always succeed in this match.
The Czechs, after a six-year struggle with the Germans and Austrians, defended the designation of Olomouc tvaruzky, but the domestic rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed to tuzemák.
Naming rum can only be carried by products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
The official list of EU registered products includes the world-famous cheeses feta and gorgonzola, marzipan from Germany’s Lubeck region and Parma ham, such as Karlovy Vary biscuits, pohořelice and Třeboň carp and Žatec hops.
The EU trade mark can also be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and Hořice tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how do you think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it worked in my country, I wouldn’t be running for office.
But I can no longer watch the last twenty years of the country being robbed, the thieves running around, the taxes and the retirement age rising.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I'm already 40 and an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you went to the Castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the Castle based on the results of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is a tool to make my vision come true.
That is why I need as much influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
But the problem is not only that we, as a nation, curse in the pub and in front of the television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
Add to this the media that defame people and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was accused of bribing a journalist or being an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You went into the fight for the Castle with the thesis of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and return property returns over twenty million.
To do that, you have to change the law.
But as president, you don't have that kind of authority, and only the Senate as a whole can draft laws.
How are you going to handle this?
When I lobbied as a citizen for free trade, it succeeded.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or from the right, he deliberately rejects it, and this delays the citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party pigeonholes and dogmas, I can take something that is best for our country from every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be a leftist or a rightist?
From the Czech point of view, I think people are putting me to the left.
It doesn’t matter if it’s a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for us to move forward.
I don’t care if they belong to the left or the right, but I want to bring people together.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or ODS, and I will oppose the bad idea as well.
You get angry when someone says you’re a populist.
But aren't you proving it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Some might call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, you will only have passwords.
You won’t be able to do that in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to assert, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Persuading politicians, journalists and the public and trying to get them on our side to push for it.
If I had been elected president, there would be no problem in holding a live television broadcast where I would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legislate material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They might have to explain why they don’t want it.
If there is a strong personality who will name bad things, it is possible to push on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was due to public pressure.
To be honest, I'm an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I try to find allies.
I have only just started in politics and I will try to get majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things around by myself, if I can't, I'll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I won’t do anything in one person, so I went around a number of well-known people to see if they would also run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the fraud with light heating oils.
I've been running because people are really unhappy, but now I'm on the fence.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and those who did mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people elected the Senate so that changes would be difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you thinking of starting your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check every potential party member’s clean past, and I don’t have the money for that either.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20 grand in my transparent account.
No money?
You're talking about property returns, what's yours?
I estimate private property at about $60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who used to ride in the car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against bad and bad.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have $60 million in assets, and you don't have the campaign money?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don’t want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million to campaign.
I'm supposed to be in debt?
I've spent $2.5 million on the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that I don't think there's that much interest in my program.
And I'm under no obligation to pay for the campaign on my own.
The cost of the campaign is basically going to cover what I'm going to get for the senator's salary.
But I wouldn’t make a living from it, for example, I wouldn’t be able to pay for my son’s English school, which costs $30,000 a month.
If I wanted to make money, I wouldn’t be running.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd stop these activities?
It has nothing to do with salary.
As promised, I have partially stopped my activities.
For example, the travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I also need something to live on.
How much did you spend as an entrepreneur per month?
Two hundred to 400,000, which I'll take further.
And if I were president, I'd shut down my business.

MVRDV Architects are proof that real adventures don't just happen in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
"I find the building cheerful, it looks futuristic, and there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks along the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a nearby large company, thinks, "Of course, the house is nice."
I wonder why we still need a library.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
None of these old-style libraries are voluntary anymore, are they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate in close proximity to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities that are not worth a visit, holds a special record.
With a population of 80,000, the municipality has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
To solve this stupid situation, a few years ago, the decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
However, the success of the educational campaign was not overwhelming.
And so the city councilors realized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we had to have a library!
Winy Maas of the MVRDV architectural studio in Rotterdam, master of insanely bold bar charts and maker of witty, often cynical structures, accepted the matter with the usual calm and appeared at the 2003 competition with five books under his arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the commission was still looking around in amazement and shrugging its shoulders, the brash Maas piled his gifts on top of himself by size and ended his activist speech with the words "Dear City Municipality!"
So this is my proposal for the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was piled up for 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Mountain of Books was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town grey, which could not offer more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an extraordinarily ugly town hall, behind the white facade of which you would expect a dairy, is richer in a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: a reader's eldorado under the cheese lid.
Although the lift runs through the massif of the mountain, you will discover true spatial and reading passions only when climbing the topography on foot.
The glazed interior is bright and clear from all sides, the floor made of burnt fibreglass and the elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, a dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
“Normally, bookshelves stand along the facade, and there’s a large dark space in the middle that’s mostly uncozy and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed the reader’s space from the inside out.
The interior of the Hill of Books is cleverly used: in the center there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and a house equipment exchange.
A special delight are the black book shelves, which are one wall covering, one window sill, and at other times a railing of stairs.
The appearance, structure and smell are foreign.
Even sworn architects and construction engineers shake their heads over unknown building materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials here,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipal council of Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard magazine.
So one day, in a Frisian farm, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years, a millimetre fleece made of synthetic material has been used as a substrate under the roots in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
Thin textile lasts for one or two seasons and is then ripe to be thrown away in bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantity - was pressed onto boards four centimeters thick.
Due to heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous and load-bearing material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
Take the 105 steps to get to the top.
At the end of your almost 500-meter journey, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the correct humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
“You probably wouldn’t believe it, but this house, despite its many glass surfaces, is a showcase project in terms of ecology,” Trouborst says.
It is heated and cooled by the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass lid, the sun shines inside only briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden trusses, which stand perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as a shading and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest can handle fully automatic roller shutters.
Stefan Spermon, an early IT sceptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls Boekenberg the “long-awaited soul” of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from his personal fund.
At first, the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently has 70,000 pieces, were to be filled.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are completely full.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, everyone has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called identity formation.
Spijkenisse wrote a history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he is.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the decision to accept Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is teetering on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany signalled earlier this week that it would vote against a proposal for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's going to support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
It was eventually adopted by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that they are just changing their foreign policy, away from the US-controlled policy, so to speak, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are on two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still settling into their role, but they are on the way to a more “normal” foreign policy.
The foreign policy they have in France or the UK.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean in German terms?
It shows readiness to take positions in the case of national interests that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect her interests.
Did economic interests influence attitudes in the Middle East conflict and voting at the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to scare away the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
That plays a role anyway.
But I wouldn’t want to give too much importance to it either, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
In any case, this plays an important role in German thinking.
Did it damage Germany’s relations with the US when Germany abstained in both important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the USA there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic a turning point as it was in Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect from it.
This signals that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States is clearly in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal politics.
I think the Obama administration probably has a deep understanding of the European position.
However, due to the political situation there, this position cannot, of course, be held publicly.
I think the differences of opinion are not at all as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would have been a little easier for the Germans if there had been a coherent and united European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
Therefore, they cannot be part of a broader line and must instead drive things forward from their own position.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future and will push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does it even want to take on the lead role?
Or is leadership still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult for this country to play a larger role.
For example, if we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes on a larger role, anti-German sentiment is created.
This does not make it easier for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now steadily decreasing, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum. Who else is left here?
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, D.C., an institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America jointly study the challenges of the transatlantic community.
In addition, Szabo is a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German policy, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a brand that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they enjoy protection until they are sued by the real owners of the brand.
And even then, it is not clear whether the law will be enforced.
"For foreigners, it's becoming increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, which specializes in breaching protective rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
Counterfeiters only need a few more letters to register their tags.
For example, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada they register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, such as sports goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens stamp office filing cabinet in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the Zegna DF Puma trademark protected, an artificial name that also parasitizes the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The Chinese are known to be world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-story department stores in which counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
Pattloch's cases are different, however, and on behalf of his clients, he is against Chinese companies receiving the official right to use a trademark that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
They are women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
“It’s hurting trade, we have to fight it,” Pattloch said.
"Brand dilutes, exclusive position disappears, image damage is overwhelming."
The financial losses and court costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China is the third largest luxury goods market and the fastest growing.
However, the deletion of questionable entries in the register of marks is difficult to achieve and costs something.
The procedure can be extended for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed the lawsuits because the accused name became a "market reality" after a long duration.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is a law of the jungle.
Known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction equipment manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO acknowledges that there were deficiencies in 2010 due to too few employees and space.
But last year, he reportedly “returned from an emergency to normal.”
For example, the number of pending opposition proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than the previous year.
There are still 81,500 complaints pending.
Doing something about it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million brand protection applications, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China is leading the list of new applications worldwide for the tenth time in a row.
This also applies to the number of valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected in fees.
In simple terms, this means that on average, each login costs 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
It costs several times more to start a dispute, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
The company has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans achieved the fact that its illegal production of imitation car parts was canceled.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget it ourselves, because in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO also rejected the Munich company’s objection.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg won the right, but the opponent continues to fight in the dispute to this day.
We need to be very careful
The matter is now being heard by the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Management is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs can not be quantified. In the archive of the company, they even had to examine the hundred-year-old files to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the counterparty a "high six-figure euro" in order to settle the dispute.
“You can see what this means for us,” says Wentzler.
The danger from the Far East threatens to hit Europe as well.
This is especially true when imitators have unprotected tags.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg brand for shoes and leather in Germany.
This area of business the concern long ago gave up, yet managed to avert registration.
“You have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch advise German businesses to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Foreigners should "apply for anything worth protecting in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs in the final act of his brand drama, then he will probably have to pay the counterparty royalties on his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses - and in Swaziland, orphans from parents who died of AIDS are happy about it.
The story of a connection that spans much more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, there’s the stomping: cowboy boots, basketball boots, women’s pumps, and men’s loafers look for tact on the dance floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly rise up, urging, mummifying and prosecuting each other.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it off his textile shoes as he joins voices with his wily wild gestures.
It's Monday night, in the music hall of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty female and male singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from human genetics researcher to caretaker.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choral voice has a different lyrics and, moreover, in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS program, estimates that there are about 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans from parents who died of AIDS.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV positive.
For the 180 orphans who died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found patrons in the village of Esitjeni in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
Patronage can be taken for 15 or 20 euros per month.
It guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day at the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "he who exalts" in the Zulu language.
No one can speak fluent Bantu in this space, only sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has rehearsed the songs in this foreign soft language, and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 km from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which is dependent on the strength of the votes of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in plain earthen or straw huts, a large proportion of whom are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, it is seen in the little that makes the whole of Swaziland sick: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry the weakened immunity virus inside them. It is no rare occurrence that they die in less than thirty years.
This village was discovered by the congregation during a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but above all, members of the Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, they have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was still a private commitment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, just a year later, the Voices for Africa congregation was founded, which has since cared for orphans from parents who died of AIDS almost professionally.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis.
Mussels and scabies belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who is in the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently are chlamydia infections, trichomonas, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults, but about 20 percent of newly infected people belong to this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections involve young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are often found among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were 2,700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
The danger of infection can be reduced by condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infection from dirt and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent rotation of sexual partners.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations, and last but not least, the royalties that the choir earns by singing all over Germany, some money will be collected.
“We have already sent a total of about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” said Annette Lennartz, president of Esitjeni.
Money from Germany is being managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who is able to assert herself.
He also takes care that orphaned children find shelter, such as at a grandmother’s home.
Gogo, as old women are called in the Zulu language, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure the children arrived at school on time each day.
The children, who no longer have anyone, go to the shelter of Khanyisila, a lonely woman who is paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa founded a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to take an HIV test.
Although the disease is so obvious across the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is absolutely taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, it's pretty weird in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immoderate lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-sanctioned way of life is also to blame for the fact that HIV has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, “but nobody uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse."
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through southern Africa once every two or three years, singing songs full of sorrow, fighting, confidence in the future and self-confidence of blacks, which many in the southern corner of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also has already shed tears in many wild border soldiers.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although you can hardly find this village on the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni it is more than famous.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is light,” people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is 8,733 kilometers away, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Strasse, you can see that the light is shining here, too.
NASA has discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the region of this planet, which lies in permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters thick and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
This water appears to have come from comets, or perhaps from asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let’s not connect the finding of ice to the existence of life on this planet, said Sean Solomon, a senior scientist working on the Messenger spacecraft.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help explain how water and other fundamental elements of life reached other regions of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved by Earthlings, take part in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, small windows to endless distances.
The image is from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which circles the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's 2006 new conceptual definition.
This cutout from the Spitzer infrared image shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, the more difficult to identify are the pinkish-colored "new-born" in the birthing hall of the stars.
This star-forming region, which scientists call W5, has been discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This changing glow of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The muffin ring consists of material that the star ejected during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
A photograph of the Galactic Cradle was taken by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the "Seven Sisters", is visible at night with the naked eye.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may look like a red eye to an observer in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblance to the Earth's continent gave this nebula the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the cause of an extraordinary coloration.
This "baby" among the stars was captured in full glory by infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.

It may be the remains of Saturn's moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: a vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies become true works of art according to their coloration.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, trigeminal), because the dark streaks of dust divide the burning heart of this stellar nursery into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonosh, astronomers have photographed a harbinger of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are racing towards each other, and a collision must inevitably occur.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who does not like technical abbreviations, can call it a nickname South Windmill.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a view of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
This 1,400-light-year-old nebula consists of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than normal house dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, has been recorded by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call this larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of the stars gives rise to ever new additions.
Also, these star clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, are still giving birth to new young stars, 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our views of space: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, and was used by Galileo Galilei a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever larger - and the views they convey have grown ever deeper.
The largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was five meters in diameter.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, its diameter reaches about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the cheap method of construction: the telescope is secured with a hook at a height angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
Despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, this compares to the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - any computer owner can help to make his computing power available.

The Very Large Telescope stands here - and it honors its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is 42 meters long and consists of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
The pictures can be taken in 2018 at the earliest.
Two of Keck's telescopes on Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into space with the help of the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea is to be created a new giant telescope - with a diameter of 30 meters mirror.
You can admire it in the picture.
However, the most important impressions from space are conveyed by the Hubble Space Telescope.
He has been giving us pictures of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been detected since the mission began.
The image documents the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe there is ice at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger circles this planet much closer to the North Pole.
For decades, radar measurements have shown that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger spacecraft, which was launched in 2004, and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.

The Talysh mountain ride can be called wildly romantic.
The minibus rattles along the road with many turns along densely forested hills, predatory rivers, and plain farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems that we are in the Black Forest.
But this is the farthest south of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group Talysh, about whom little is known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and live to a very old age.
The final stop is Lerik.
This small town boasts overly monumental architecture from Soviet times, which somehow does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours to cover 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-lane.
The fabulous wealth that countries owe to oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the countryside.
However, Pilata Fatulajeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest in May - and we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world next year," said Fatulajeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of nearly eight dozen Talysh from the surrounding area, who are 100 years old. Fatulajeva shows a black-and-white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he fathered a child.
The controversial star of the museum, however, is the sheepherder Íirali Mäsl mov, who is said to be 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person with papers was 122 years old, the age of Musslov seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulajeva explains.
The man is said to have been married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he is said to have fathered a daughter.
Wasn't Čirali M?sl?mov, at his age, a few decades off the mark?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about older people in Central Asia.
“Significantly many people of old age live in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley of Pakistan,” Scholz says, “there are also extremely many very old men living in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific proof of age can be given, especially when registers are missing.
Every day a glass of melted butter
The fact is, however, that people in the area around Lerik often live to the biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why are there so many elderly people in the South?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with special Talysh genes.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatuljeva Museum believes that it consists in nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of Talysh people, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, does not seem very plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzaev lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a buttercup, which he tirelessly cradles.
Eight people live under the same roof, including one of Mirzajeva’s sons and daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
There are also two small children jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical bellied glasses of "armad".
Mirzajeva’s white teeth form a perfect line and under the scarf hides long dark blond braids, which her son proudly reveals in front of us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't fall out and kept its color.
"I've never used shampoo either," Mirzajeva says.
A monthly pension is enough.
She always ate only what came from her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven’t bought food at a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells me about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was during the Second World War.
But everything improved when the oar was taken over by the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds weird from an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that takes place around the figure of the father of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros), which is a good amount to live on.
Mirzaev’s long-gray son may be right: “Old people have great respect in our culture.”
They live in the middle of a big family, they are loved, cared for and they are happy.
Unless it's a reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" is missing in the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations in Cairo have exposed the country’s deep ambivalence.
A future constitution based on sharia law is being strongly debated.
Egypt's president spared no pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And for us to succeed, I am responsible, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but above all to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "state of God" on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetic, said he had temporarily reduced the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers to "save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear about.
Should the judiciary be stripped of power?
The 234 paragraphs that the 100-headed Islamist-dominated Constituent Assembly hastily approved in the 15-hour night marathon are of some concern.
As in earlier constitutions, this proposal says that jurisdiction is based on “the principles of Islamic law.”
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use this vague formulation and the associated legal space for a more rigorous interpretation of sharia.
At the very least, this is illustrated by the newly added paragraph: In all matters pertaining to sharia, one must consult al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence over all Sunni Islam.
This may not be the case, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight over the legislation, which would effectively deprive the judiciary of its authority.
There are many things in the interpretation of the Constitution.
The civil jurisdiction of the military courts is also to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
According to the proposal, the state should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values".
This is legally formulated so inaccurately that by means of this article, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
Indeed, no paragraph in writing defines explicit equality between men and women.
Another paragraph forbids denigrating or defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
But it remains unclear what defamation is and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that "insulting people" is prohibited.
Is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of legal experts enough in this case?
The matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which Morsi will put forward for signature and, in his words, will be presented to the Egyptians "very soon" for the purpose of a popular vote.
"The Revolution has returned"
For several weeks now, opposition to the Islamists has been taking shape.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday night in an unusual fashion, pledging to destroy the constitutional charter before it takes effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbáhi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradei said the draft constitution belonged "to the dustbin of history".
Through a short message service, Twitter accused supporters of Morsi of wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy".
"If they call a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition official Yasser Said said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet being punished,” Egyptian opposition politician Khalid Ali said.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood announced a demonstration, not in Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and Salafist supporters who shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called out to Morsi, “Purify the land!” and said, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably trigger a civil war-like state.
Morsi's supporters clearly didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the Islamist proposal is considered to be certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur once"
A forced constitutional dispute that should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, according to Hafez Abu Sa’da.
The 48-year-old human rights defender and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now in the new constitution, the words 'human rights' are not even once," he laments in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's extension of power to all three branches of power in the state forced the lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of empowering civil society, the president effectively abolished it,” Sa’da said.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Sa'da also feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the struggle of the ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could backfire on him.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian rakfisk: The most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to a local appetite for an extraordinarily smelly fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football outfits.
Let it rest for a week.
This gives you a sense of the paralyzing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s biggest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a magnificent view - and a pervasive smell hangs in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes begin to gather for a festival dedicated to this, how to put it, most captivating dish.
"You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavite," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk general" who is responsible for the course of the festival.
All around us, people eat small cubes of fish and drink a lot of alcohol.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” says Havard.
The smell of the drink can overwhelm.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that's been on a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no refrigerators yet, the fish were soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses no doubt dulled with alcohol.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by a large amount of work, high earnings and an extensive system of care.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival that was just recently much richer than Norway, are pouring into the country for work.
The rakfisk is seen as something important, an indispensable, if rather stinking, part of Norway's past.
It is one of the more expensive foods on the market.
Even if expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($14) apiece.
Norway often does not make it into the world news - and most of the population seems to be comfortable with that.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned with distaste.
Instead, the shooting is called the "July 22 event."
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway’s current wealth lies the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says our waitress Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, is a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We are, as they say, thoughtful people.
Her English, like that of most people here, is absolutely impeccable.
We don't show off, we don't like pomp.
Norway treats its oil wealth very carefully - apart from a small percentage, most of the money from the industry is invested in a special fund designed for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial crash was throwing away money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had the cords firmly tightened on their purse.
“As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy,” Anna says.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of the rakfiska.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But the smelly fish is here again tonight.
The hotel where I live is one of many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They're connected to a live TV show where the presenter is surrounded by rakfisk plates with a bow tie.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is applause and laughter.
A man falls from a chair, possibly aquavitated.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexico's incoming president, Enrique Pena Nieto, prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly poor.
In a city that is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers have been erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the goal was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive a presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico was doing well economically during Felipe Calderon’s presidency, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already killed an estimated 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has a big commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the US president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions about the new leader differ even in his old homeland, a populous and sprawling state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in a good way.
Citizens attribute to him the development of resort tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto built. These highways are a huge improvement over the leaky and bumpy roads that were here before.
Plates with his name also hang on the wall of the modern sports center and the impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
“We expect it to bring real and lasting change,” said Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a friend and political ally of President Pen Nieto’s party, the Institutionalized Revolution Party (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in security and economy that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 uninterrupted years in power, the PRI party was ousted by Vicente Fox.
MP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected from Enrique Pena Nieto inside the party.
And he rejects the expression of opposition characterizing the new president as a person without substantial content.
He is a very straightforward person, very interested with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and above all, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Tucked under highway overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the self-governing community are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help with the handling of drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially the burning violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to a huge garbage dump.
At the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, critics of Pena Nieto say he failed to adequately address the issue of women’s murders.
And in the worst case, they accuse him of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house typical of a dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses her crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
“When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed,” Buendia recalls.
There were marks on it after the blows, and the rigors of the postmortem had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is a single word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, troublemaker and whiner.
They want you to simply accept what they say and remain silent.
“But it can’t be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions,” he says.
The sash that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has vowed to make it a priority while in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," PRI MP Olvera said in Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of abusive treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in the town of Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the basis of Manning's abusive treatment in prison.
He is accused of stealing thousands of documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the abusive treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor, Maj. Ashden Fein, cross-examined Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers over the course of nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during a hearing conducted at the request of the defence to dismiss a case brought against Manning on grounds of ill-treatment during the period of detention, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide while in custody.
An army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then posted online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein and Manning went through forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at Quantico's detention center, where he was held under heightened security from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When asked about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional".
Forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly asked Manning how he was being treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about various problems orally and that the officers who visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they did not record these problems.
"They wrote down 'no problems' (after discussing the concerns) and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment of himself in January 2011 in a meeting with a commission assessing suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed several months earlier in the form.
Manning responded that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime.
The military said it used this restrictive regime (one level below the suicide watch) for its protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime ... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life that I saw," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday of his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention facility at Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and one time he fainted because of the heat.
He stated that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very disheartening.
"My world has shrunk only to the base of Arifjan, to that cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning stated that after arriving at Quantico, he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, slippers, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying down during the day was against regulations.
Manning said he always slept with the light on the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards could not see his face when he turned the other way at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning was also asked about the charges he made in Thursday's deposition, relating that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other fellow prisoners in the morning count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket while counting.
In a Friday hearing conducted by Judge Manning, he stated that he had decided, by order of his guards, that he had a blanket to cover himself with, but admitted that no one had given him the order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning stated that he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his slippers to hurt himself, but he did not.
Manning testified that his underwear, his slippers, and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that if he is convicted before a military court, which is expected to begin at the beginning of next year, he will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it plans to plead guilty to lower crimes and that it will fight the other charges because they are too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to begin this week, with the military prosecutor expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said in a statement that Manning was held in accordance with regulations regarding all detainees held in maximum security custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally causing intelligence documents to be posted on the Internet, transmitting information related to national security, and stealing public property or records.
If he is convicted on all counts, he can be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Crisis of Mexican-American Identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico City, I barely made it through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area, where I ran into a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Strangers").
I stood there for a few seconds and didn’t know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called a "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston are called "Iry" and my friends in New York are called "Italy".
So later I ended up with the term "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.
But I don’t have a native speaker’s vocabulary and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and lined up for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment when newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House this week.
They had the usual things on the agenda that are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as to travel to the United States.
He wants to join with the United States and Canada to create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue Mexico’s war on drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader to transfer half of the Mexican territory to the United States under threat of arms.
But for Mexicans who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.
So, one minute after a U.S. official says something a little bit critical about Mexico, you will hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the elite about how Americans are interfering with their neighbor’s sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will set out on the warpath.
And yet, the real challenge for Mexico is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people the country offers options to and others it doesn’t.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than not, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we are living the American dream now, going to good schools and having a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat, and they view us as an inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence, in their opinion, is only about failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they would never have left.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans bear it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don’t have roots in either one.
In Mexico, he sees us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to further complicate relations, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence I learned on my trip want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should be telling our fellow Americans how great it is to visit this country, and pressuring political leaders to fortify relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And because of income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t sure it’s a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel uneasy about the way in which their family members were treated in the substantially closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such occurrence is futile.
Among the usual useless rumors of who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, killing more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets fell from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, like it or not, are caught in the chaos of the region.
It may make their fight bloodier than ever.
However, there are reasons to believe that this can interrupt their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little reason for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire on November 21 lasts, the fighting this week has boosted hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most deplorable and populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently run by its staunch rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists across the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that was once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and most dynamic countries.
The cheering Hamas people say the Islamic crescent is encircling Israel, north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah is ruling, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly leaning toward Islamism can depose Bashar al-Assad, all the way to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Above all, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that cannot be ruled out by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will come to opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system proved its worth, and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as staunch as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the last round of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively calm from suicide bombers, in part thanks to a wall that extends into the West Bank, a major part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality from international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party allied with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire missiles like their compatriots in Gaza did?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
The hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
While Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel very much, their top priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economy.
The fact that President Morsi worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and could mark the beginning of something new.
Israelis should also look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denial of Palestinians’ rights to self-determination is creating a barrel of gunpowder that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel, just like the bus that blew up in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this situation as the Arab population grows.
Bloody attacks against Gaza every few years to push back Hamas will increasingly take a diplomatic toll.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what sensible people on both sides say, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two states where Israel cedes territory for the sake of security.
In the short term, there is little hope that a ceasefire will provide at least a little more leverage to push the matter forward.
Egypt, which along with Turkey and Qatar must work to halt arms shipments to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with an exchange of part of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from outside must also push for a consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has his share in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant in his entry into the process.
That's pathetically short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This is a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia came into force the laws on ugly cigarette packaging
On the unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, there are warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australia's ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging laws, the first of their kind in the world, came into force, replacing the brand's logos and colors with generic olive-green boxes featuring hideous images of sick body parts and images of babies and newborns ill from smoking their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, the only mandatory difference between the boxes are the brand names printed in the same small print.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by depriving it of its appeal.
Studies show that if people don’t start smoking by age 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never start smoking.
“Even with very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them with their product,” says federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world, and changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering introducing similar measures.
The tobacco industry has lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that this law will increase black market trading, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“There will be serious unintended consequences from this legislation,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring many more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others say the law has increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for silicone cigarette packaging used to hide disgusting boxes had increased from near-zero sales two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal over laws to Australia's Supreme Court.
Ha said Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and is expecting new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible setback, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic group targeted by the plan.
After a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and demanding that most retailers hide cigarettes from direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
“If you’re a tobacco industry marketer and only have this little space left to promote your products, online space is an unbeatable place for you to be,” says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in ratings of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honza".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job of creating this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia argues that the industry has focused on how it will handle the new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries trade significantly with Australia.
The SOO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments considering similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photos in 2001.
It has now spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering stricter laws.
There are many smokers in Australia.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take out your cigarette and put the box back in," Victor El Hage says when buying a box with a photo of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason for me to quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in central Sydney, says it makes it harder for him to stack boxes.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them altogether, then we'd say, 'OK, that's it, let's close the shop,'" he said, throwing up his hands.
In a world of constant connection is not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane was in mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and an iPhone (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and child development experts are increasingly coming up with the praise of boredom.
They say it’s good for us (and our kids) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don’t have a chance to enjoy the boredom.
Should we encourage boredom?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'll come back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more leisure time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, says, he is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
The difficulty is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After viewing the research literature and presenting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it".
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says there's no compulsion to do anything about apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is "disrupting the process of attention, associated with a bad mood and a sense of slowly passing time."
Being bored can be a lot like being depressed.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see the problem as an environment or world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape to which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group could not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but they weren't sure why and attributed the difficulty to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, attention deficit disorder can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, “like finding the wrong parts on a factory line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored.”
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and doodling, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to fidget learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We've all been bored at times - the delay of my flight, the humming speaker, the particularly lengthy film.
But some individuals are more likely to be bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists developed the Boredom Proneness Scale in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions such as: "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all.".
Using these scales, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knows “adolescence is the peak time for boredom,” which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble or abuse addictive substances as a way to alleviate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Boredom is your brain’s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at NYU.
But the brain doesn’t always know the best thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will not be bored anymore, but he will not learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, said Professor Fenske.
And "this self-management is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of it.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are away from the constant rattling of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse it of needing to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise turns off."
There is no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and soccer player from southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal charges for what will soon be legal across the state for possession of several grams of marijuana and the pipe he used to smoke her.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September he was driving with several friends in Lamar, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was issued a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment to use drugs - minor offenses that cost $100 for each fine - and was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," Mr Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following Colorado's vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response to hundreds of minor drug cases depends on the location rather than the law.
Hundreds of marijuana offenses have already been dropped here and in the state of Washington, which has passed similar measures.
The police department has stopped blaming adults aged 21 and older for holding a small amount that will be legally allowed after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative precincts have stated that they will continue with existing marijuana cases, and still blame people for possession.
At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This thing is going so fast, I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
Even the regulators in Washington state are scratching their heads.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sales - all by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Licensing Council.
But as Mr Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
“There is no real precedent to follow,” he said.
The Washington I-502 Act comes into effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal possession does.
And there are tricky mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this time, such as how to balance the state's "adequate access" directive to licensed marijuana with its ban on the trade of cannabis within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently established research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his officers announcing that the city's prosecutor would no longer prosecute violations for possession of small amounts of marijuana by any citizen over 21 and that police would "effectively" stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them face additional charges.
"Our office is required to prosecute criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time they occurred," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response was complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer blame adults for holding small amounts.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but has also decided not to dismiss all pending possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have revealed a deep ambivalence among local officials with regard to this large-scale state green experiment.
For district attorneys, this is a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the defendants for possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are well on their way to becoming national test cases for the legalization of the drug.
Advocates and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized marijuana sales while anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will bow.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana sellers and patients using it, the federal government has mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are unlikely to break down the door to intercept a small bag of the drug, they are likely to resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana deals allowed by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser to the Obama administration's anti-drug policy.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to proceed.
Even before election day, some local governments approved a moratorium on any new marijuana business, though it will be about a year before any store can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely to come into effect next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where we license someone and then we have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the community voted for, versus what the state voted for.
There's really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a Conservative".
It is not only today’s students who are attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at a university that I thought was the world’s largest seat of knowledge, a modern wrapped Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, freedom of thought and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of joining Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my bags and plunged into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I objected to the students making love in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson famously stated that I left because I was forced to drink from battered mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask why I'm only bringing it up now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of the center suffer from similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred against conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students claimed the same protections of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Younger Years Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College argue that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks, and shown that they are not welcome".
They call for the creation of a position on the University Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that they are free to express their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recently launched BBC Two documentary programme Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, which portrayed the Conservatives as oddballs and neo-Nazis.
The show featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit, and had a cane with a silver head.
At other colleges, conservative students say they are being treated like "victim lambs" because of the introduction of higher tuition.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without them meeting us at all."
A 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi, Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is "unpleasant," while 19-year-old elected OUCA president Stephanie Cherill says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members toward people to the right of Wednesday.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate as well as to members' well-being," he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18-year-old and cripplingly shy.
The hatred for the Conservative Party was the most bitter.
A year earlier, the university had voted to refuse to award an honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.
Even Stalinists would be apprehensive about the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students were interacting with each other and with the professors, I got to taste the wormwood that was to come.
I have found that not only do professors tacitly approve of the teasing of conservative pupils, but they gladly participate in it.
A policy of mining strike, privatization and government resistance to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was brought to the wood-clad auditoriums.
My first talk was about translating an 18th-century French text into English, and I wasn’t prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was pretty good at it.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake dough, was very gall.
"Do the Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students sniggered.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you're too busy with social matters," Professor Pitt snarled.
I went back to my room in disarray.
At dinner at school, I was sitting alone when I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, that's the case.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted I didn't agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics, and economics who (what an irony) went to Eton said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students talked to him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to change into a Labour and suppress my natural inclinations?
For three years, they developed before me as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who resided at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of those who write speeches to her.
He was almost there.
He hated the place for its provinciality and pettiness, and for its tendency toward a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took up the position of professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, seeking refuge with my disinterested metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dreamy mood.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect manners.
His wet eyes were drenched.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional endurance deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week, in the course of teaching, when another professor of history declared in complete seriousness that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even though I blushed with shame inside, I confessed to having been “brainwashed by my parents” and called them “old fools.”
The relief was short-term.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was hammered by my father.
At the time, he was writing two columns for Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I shuffled inside and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
After they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snot-nosed wimp.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and poison in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, it was Oxford that not only produced 14 conservative prime ministers, but that also hides to this day behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of fashion creation", which opened this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, an ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition by Valentino Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: master of fashion creation", which presents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not have been written without his honored clients.
Valentino has always felt charmed by the rare and remote world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, is bursting with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to an idol of international "bohemian royalty".
There is nothing wrong with loving the royal family.
“They’re not going to put their cigarette butt in a great rug, like some great pop-music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
He is still a star.”
Valeria Mazz presents Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazz is not forgotten about the designer’s charisma.
"It's been many years since we went to see him for dinner after one show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us, and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr., were among us.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, everything was reflected and his spirit was felt.
He made all those invited feel important and loved,” recalls the top model who started working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
The Highness Show
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but of love truly returned.
He loves people with good manners and better titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been rebuilt into a distinctive seventy-meter-long passage that offers a role-changer: the visitor turns into a model and marches through the passage to observe the "audience" of dreams that Valentino's masterpieces are wearing, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Ditzi wore in "The Night", or the coat that belonged to the Emperor's
Names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg shine in the audience.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like a first love, "one cannot forget him".
"I remember it perfectly.
They were trousers, shirts, a gillette vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection of 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to others because of his femininity and great love for women, because he underlines our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria said.
"I really like the colors he uses, they brighten up a lot and give a 'spark' to the face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Not even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how she first dressed Valentino.
Growing up and living in Italy, she longed to be of age and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It finally arrived in the late 1990s.
"I bought my first Valentine's Day dress to celebrate at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a frilled skirt, a bodice and a strapless top.
It was a dream that came true," says the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is lax about fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains an Italian aristocrat whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in themselves".
"King" of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
To create this silk dress of ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of different lace and a siding four and a half meters long, it took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses).
According to journalist Suza Menkes, the greatest authority on the specialized press, this dress represents a landmark of late 20th-century high fashion, the "return of high-society clients".
Valentino, dazzled over the years by the elitist "savoir-átre" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honour in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded by the Legion of Honour amass as much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his savvy, serenity, well-groomed and impeccable appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was brilliant, time left no trace on him."
If the princess says so...
World's Hardest Craft: Sulfur Carriers in the Kawah Ijen Volcano
For four euros, carriers in the Indonesian volcano area gamble with their life and health as they lay 70 kilos of sulfur down steep stone trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by mining sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, they have to dig to the bottom of the crater every day, where sulfur gases escape from the interior of the Earth and pass into a solid state upon contact with air.
After cutting large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them off on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
To the summit of the volcano, which rises 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but it takes the exhausted carriers over 40 minutes to climb at a turtle pace, because they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps so that they do not slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumble could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine
When they are up, they make their way around the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and tired of carrying the heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for making matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
“Because we normally carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,” explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and is ruined at the end, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
While this seems like a negligible amount for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, for collecting coffee you pay 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day, and the salary in a fortnight is 2 million rupees (167 euros)," explains the bearer, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as compelling in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the volcano Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on him, despite his face being protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases escaping from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I’m going to work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than decent English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, beset by fate, could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, and instead do the work of a porter.
It shares a filthy wooden hut with other porters and wakes up at 2 a.m. every day, as sulfur continues to bubble up at night and its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and glows in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto climbs into the crater and lights his way with a small flashlight attached to his helmet and bought it himself with his money.
About 400 carriers are carrying sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Although the company has a high income, it did not mechanize sulfur mining because of cost savings, nor does it provide any equipment to carriers working on their own and with such effort.
In fact, they don’t even get a share of the 30,000 rupees ($2.5) of the photography surcharge that, along with a 15,000 rupee ($1.2) ticket, the park’s guardians choose from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for cattle, not people,” said Madrusin, a 42-year-old heavy carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will keep working "as long as possible" because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches the miners in the thick fumes that come out of the volcano, the miners are so claimed that none of them complain that they suffer from serious diseases... but this is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and wounds on the shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues dig up 15 tons of sulfur in a volcano, which three trucks then take on a steep path between the thickets to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik said, opening his mouth wide, missing several teeth.
Of his five sons, the eldest, a 30-year-old, also earns by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world's heaviest crafts persists from generation to generation - the crafts performed by human mules at Kawah Iljen.
Singapore Seeks Babies to Save the Economy
Singaporeans are seduced by the fact that they do not have children, for careers, stress and the cost of living and education.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but nevertheless - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local "put a bun in the oven" cues as a mockery of Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency that created the video, hopes the ad will draw attention to the problem in a humorous way.
The agency's artistic director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfill "their civic duty".
“It’s all about the internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
This is the country's biggest problem.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt it was a topic we had to touch on.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things, like expand perfumes with pheromones or organize introduction parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like making a rap, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it too lightly is the Singaporean government.
They spend $1,300 a year encouraging citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extending maternity leave, and allocating financial benefits.
However, all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with respect to stratification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate, was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Department of the National Population Authority, says this is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
“People have a wider range of choices when it comes to life goals and priorities, not just marriage and family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to the postponement of marriage and childbearing, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there were efforts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against population declines, this caused resentment among local residents.
Some Singaporean websites show undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and making little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party recorded its worst election result since independence began last year.
After the elections, there was an effort to solve the problem using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending, and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate business.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boot boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments may support a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers from building large single-family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the development firm EL Developers, says their "bootboxes" are selling much faster than larger homes.
“They’re more popular, so they sell days to weeks faster than larger homes.
That’s why they’re much better for our cash flow.”
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules could lead to an increase in the nation’s birth rate, a conversation with Singaporeans working in the city’s financial district suggests they won’t have much of an effect.
“People are still stressed, houses are expensive, as is education, which is why many people put it off,” says the young official.
“Let others have children.
But for me it is important to rely on my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old, a young man.
Both men and women mention careers, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force its citizens to have children, it is Singaporeans who have the final say on starting a family.

According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something of a personal nature or an “area of private life that everyone has the right to protect themselves against any disruption”.
What is privacy for people under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely of its own" on a personal level and a "username and password" when it came to social networks.
“I wouldn’t reveal my biggest secret,” said ten-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"On FB, I put nice pictures or pictures of how we play.
I also talk to acquaintances.
I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine or a photo that would ridicule someone,” she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to post obscene photos, nude photos or crime photos, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I created a Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or communicate quickly with friends,” he says.
Without hesitation, he says, he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended a stranger to him.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and admits he doesn’t know 20 people on his friends list.
“I’m not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to this boy, none of them had any clues or asked for his address or phone number.
“If I’m being pressured or required to do so, I’ll simply remove them from my account,” she admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
This boy is no stranger to what is now called cyberbullying.
"A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” she confirms.
The victim did not log out of the account, according to José.
"You just activated the private mode."
It then explains a series of steps to set up your account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post pictures of acquaintances in awkward or awkward situations.
"Of course I would if someone bothered me or I just wanted to.
“It’s cyberbullying,” he said.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that for children and adolescents to navigate social networks properly, they need to understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform.
He states that: "The Internet originated as a means of seeking information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of education at Yale University and author of Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born in the era of this technology.
We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them and yet we are still learning,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet ripe for it."
Also, to be prudent, in terms of surroundings, at a time when what they most desire is to be liked, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences,” he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and teens what privacy is is by asking questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do something doesn’t work,” he adds.
Next, Marielos Porras lists some of the options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Would you like someone to post your picture as you posted your friend’s?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you tag people in party photos, did you ask for their permission?
And one more thing: Do they all need to know what you’re doing?
The next point is to make them aware that they must behave in the Internet environment as well as outside it.
It's the same rules.
"A person outside the Internet is governed by respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be the case on social networks," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, teacher in the first grade and educational advisor, explains that it is essential that parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand every trick, they have a good basis for talking to children about the consequences of setting up an online account.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers".
South America Summit Ends and Lima Statement Not Published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without a statement from Lima, which was announced and which was reportedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of Unasur heads of state and government, but representatives of the State Department and the presidential office, who initially determined that the document would be published after the summit, said it would later be published on the Peruvian government's website.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several brief press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly was broadcast without sound in the press room with the message "confidential session, sound transmission prevented".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by some government spokespersons who were present, but not by a Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the meeting was a list of participating presidents, prompting an outcry from hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who demanded more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an email to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but this is only a statement by President Humala, and not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and on this occasion, the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, even though it was eagerly demanded by the press.
On the official ASPA website, you can find out that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that all journalists could be broadcast, but completely cut off the flow of information.
The summit ended with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt a ruling by the Hague Court of Justice that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
Peru's President Ollanta Humala and Chile's President Sebastián Pieera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which on Monday will begin by hearing the defense speech of both sides to discuss the dispute that Lima launched against Santiago.
"We will comply and execute the judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are hearing today in this international court," said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts,” he said.
The two presidents’ confirmation that they would comply with the ruling of the International Court of Justice was made public after Colombia adopted the Bogotá Pact this week, expressing submission to the rulings of the International Court of Justice, which ruled on maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered the ruling to be completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the impeachment of then-President Fernando Luga and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning speeches and concluding the Lima Summit shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been made and activity was planned on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements, he said UNASUR member countries would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which residency agreements are being extended."
He stated that actions are being supported to improve "collaboration in the fight against civil insecurity and international organized crime, to improve access to medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to take joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) does not have to be victorious, but rather serves to expand our productivity and to show our nations a better future,” Humala added.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport connections between different places in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties,” he said.
He mentioned that five of the projects concerned Peru and the transversal axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two concerned better links with Ecuador, but did not give more details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return her to the Union of South American Nations," from which she is currently excluded.
Another of the issues highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in a regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico on Saturday to respectfully discuss the International Court of Justice's ruling on the maritime border dispute being called into question by Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, not even a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he said.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations in the most civilised and considerate manner possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Pena Nieta.
As part of the summit, EU defence ministers met tentatively to endorse the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Members of UNASUR include Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa said today that establishing a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case indeed, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who took part in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state TV Perú that Europeans "were killing each other during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one homeland".
In this sense, he advocated the project of creating South American citizenship, which is supported by Unasur member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean Community must be achieved, but there are still reactionary areas that want to put us back in the past," he said.
Ecuador's president said he agreed to regroup the Organization of American States (OAS) on condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and those who signed the San José Human Rights Pact take into account.
"Those in the lead never commit to anything, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington," Assange said.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret the decision because it did not betray his principles, and he respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that "there were reasonable suspicions at the time that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice system, which asked him to submit to questioning on Swedish territory over an alleged sexual offence, with "Sweden's own legislation allowing for a video conference call to be conducted from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been at our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But his physical and mental condition is at risk of deteriorating because he is confined to a small space without being able to move in the fresh air.
That would affect everyone’s health,” he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks have been held with London to resolve the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
"We don't negotiate on human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing conversations.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, as Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garzón is conducting a series of proceedings in various European instances,” he said.
He said: "If the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over."
And if Sweden listens to Mr Assange at the Ecuadorean embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation there allows without any problem and as has been done in other cases, the problem will be put to an end tomorrow.”
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, clarifying that he certainly does not tolerate "subparity, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
“The greatest enemies of a free press are not us, wicked and degenerate politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy that neither such journalists, "neither bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie control Ecuador", and he prefaced that if re-elected, "he will continue to make changes guided by the right way and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to further maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay over Unasur's membership until at least her next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and putschism shrouded in legality" because it in fact "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Ecuador's president said he considered "absolutely appropriate" his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos's wish to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, in the wake of the ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which ruled in Nicaragua's favor.
The sentence is not currently accepted.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed broadly in order to be overcome and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute that Peru and Chile are resolving in the same court, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries commit themselves to passing judgment, however harsh it may be".
Speaking about the possibility of running for a third term in Ecuador’s next presidential election, he said he saw the possibility “with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult.”
Correa has stated that if he loses the February 2013 election, he will retire from public life.
"I personally have never been very interested in power, but such unjust situations as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador can only be remedied by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so we have to accept this responsibility," he said.
“If I won, it would be my last term as president, and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, I expect the same.
I have made my decision," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
“I have just spoken to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says that President Chávez has left for a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a repeat of the president’s state of health,” he said.
Today, the head of state of Ecuador attended the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are now the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a lightning bolt had struck me," he recounts, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor had tried to "somewhat mitigate" but apparently without success.
The boy kept it a secret from the family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and began to learn about it, with such dedication that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the most ancient patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came in 1994 after several struggles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options, and more stigma.
At the time, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and come only after the virus has caused destruction of the organism and weakened the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the onset of AIDS, or at least the first documented cases, “means a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people,” said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, adding that this information was confirmed in a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that researchers have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease, while those who do not use drugs are better off: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV at age 25 can live without problems “while adhering to treatment until age 75,” the doctor explained in an interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, from 6,678 AIDS deaths in Mexico in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 so far this May. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
Why do people continue to die from the disease?
“I think the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens at the hospital.
The problem is that patients are coming in at a very advanced stage because they don't know the state of the disease, or late in the disease."
"Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection is present. The only thing that needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose the disease sooner, and that's why we need to offer tests on a large scale to detect the disease to all those who ask for it."
His proposal coincides with specialists and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to get tested in a private laboratory just because his friend did, and despite his young age, he has already developed AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
“Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
“If I’m going to die, I’d rather have fun three times a week,” they say, but that’s not my case.
The change was for the better, I eat healthily, I exercise, I take medication."
To this day, all his parents know is that he suffered from cancer.
“I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who has taken up the call to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony today on World AIDS Day.
"Let them take tests. If they took risks, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, it's better. And if they have already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else if they are responsible."
This message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a huge gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara-based journalist who is researching information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, “the distribution of condoms has really increased, they used to give us one or two, now they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who don’t have access to condoms,” he said.
Among the most susceptible to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees, and medical staff that teens want to avoid, a reporter says.
He suggested changing this inefficient distribution, so that condoms are not just behind the counters, but the hundred are in dispensers in public restrooms, places that young people often go to.
“It’s not about promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of "paying for a beer and a motel," as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if he would agree to a condom distribution in his district.
That's not sexuality. It's best to make condoms available to those who are already leading a sex life," he noted.
Key figures in Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV cases).
In Mexico, it ranks fourth in new and detected AIDS cases and 13th in HIV-related cases.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% via the blood and 2% via the perinatal route.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people for every registered case who are unaware of the disease.
The ruling, passed by the U.S. Court of Appeals, which does not recognize Grupo Vitro’s debt restructuring mandated by bankruptcy in Mexico, sets a bad precedent for any national business with branches in a neighboring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, the procedures for restructuring firms allowed by Mexican law do not seem to apply in the land of streaks and stars despite international agreements.
Judge Harlin Hale's June 15 ruling at the North Texas bankruptcy court leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of confiscating their assets on the other side of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door to the U.S. Supreme Court to Mexico's main glass producer, citing three irregularities.
To begin with, while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to abide by United States insolvency law, the New Orleans-based Fifth District Court of Appeals says that the main procedure provides for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, it would show ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
Essentially, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created to this end, which is appointed by the arbiter to the organization of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the voting of branches from the internal corporate structure, whereby the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority would not have been reached for the approval of the restructuring.
However, Mexican law allows for this possibility.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose in-house debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting branch votes, creditors - who opposed Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not have reached a majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37 percent.
This figure is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From a different perspective, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of the severe economic crisis that has struck the United States.
Meanwhile, the family firm of González Sady will file appeals for re-examination directly before the Court of Appeal, so that the review will take place in full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, since originally only three voted.
If he does not succeed here, he will seek a review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States, as an appeal.
The important thing in the case is that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican government as amicus curiae detailing Vitro’s procedure under the Bankruptcy Act and pointing out that the company has eased itself by adhering to agreements signed by both countries to confront the Act with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
Moreover, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules designed for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall assessment
For several months, criminal charges against the former owner of Gaston Azcárraga Andrade, who had been accused of fraud, were on the table and, according to the pilots' union, the vessel had already overflowed.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit with the National Banking Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, accusing them of obstruction of justice.
According to her, the Supervisory Authority systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, in which 198 million pesos were withdrawn from IXE from fideikomis F/589 on behalf of Mexican aviation.
The funds were probably directed towards the purchase of shares in the Professional Hotel Management (Administrador Profesional de Hoteles).
Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mart
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens gathered at the Universidad de Caribe over the weekend to approve the creation of the association to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge business and distribution center with products from the "big wall country" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area at the bottom for employees from 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) had been able to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose a monumental site that would partially devastate protected areas and represent the origin of all resistance to industry.
The end of ACTA
The request of the Senate, which was disregarded by the government and which demanded an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by the English acronym ACTA, has become outdated, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial).
As is well known, this has happened despite the fact that the Senate itself has ruled out the possibility of considering it a threat to the freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect the short-term ones, the development company Homex is giving the market investment certificates for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical ones to offer interest repayments every 28 days.
Competitive is born.
The merger of leading information technology companies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet gave birth to an association called Competival, which will target the software services market in Central and South America.
Investment in the business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball globetrotter Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has travelled the world thanks to him.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was passionate about the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior player, a BSN National Basketball League player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón National Basketball League team, or president of the Puerto Rico Basketball Federation.
“I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, general manager of the national team and chairman of the federation,” Reyes recalled while visiting reporters at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest excitement of all, he guards those that remind him of his time in Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
“That was my best years, I enjoyed it the most because I had the opportunity to take part in eight championships with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one of the championships - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
At the time, the team was taken over by "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was a coach here and who was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham at the time, saying to me, 'I've got a solid two-meter player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me to point guard Raymond Gauss, who became a member of the team and one of our top scorers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon victory in the championship, then Gauss will contribute to the next one."
He enjoyed playing Gauss for the Los Vaqueros team, but only remotely, as he was already president of the basketball federation in 1988.
At that time, he wanted to fully devote himself to his functions and enjoy Mincy’s position in the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in a qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, but we should have had the bronze if it hadn't been for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw-in," Reyes said.
Is the team from the 1990 World Cup the best national team you have ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and swatted a United States team that was quite similar to the one that blew our bronze in the World Cup.
The team had not only Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López, and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but there were also the youths (Javier) "To?ito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have had a perfect composition, but that managed to win us a gold medal and bring us great joy, was the team from the 1995 Olympic Qualifying in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players eliminated due to a skirmish at the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention the different leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation that included Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arilla.
Which of your achievements in the Federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national league BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What have you failed to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like dividing youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would play only in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the children travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see a benefit in compulsory certifications and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
I'm glad.
What are you doing now?
I mostly listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, was world-renowned for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." on the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series Dallas became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in this year’s new season of Dallas, died Friday afternoon of complications from cancer, according to the family’s official announcement to The Associated Press by the Dallas Warner Bros. production company.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he loved most," the family said in a statement.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas with him on Thanksgiving Day.
"Linda Gray, who played his wife in both the original and new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in Dallas hospital," said Hagman's agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented and I will miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in a statement.
The Hagmans were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted to drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the show aired on Dallas, Hagman rose to fame on television as a decent guy in NBC's lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (a genie) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to his home to live together.
He was also the protagonist in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His appearances in the films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterful feat of unbelievably repulsive J.R. that led him to stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and others around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who Shot Jayar?", which was supposed to raise expectations about the emotional part where Hangman's character is almost murdered, caused not only a huge amount of speculation from viewers around the world, but also risking millions of dollars in bookmakers.
This also helped to set a record in terms of viewership.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment show in history after the end of the 1983 MASH series, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and J.R. threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy man with a charismatic smile: a sly businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) locked up in a rehab facility.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on his headstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT several months ago with great success.
"Five episodes of Season 2 have been completed and a sixth one has just been filmed," the network said.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would go.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on stage in New York City and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published the autobiography Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or harm someone," he told the Prensa Asociada news agency.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped fearful patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet with them when they go into surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "do not worry, it will be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you will be healthy".
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Begins a course that explores the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to do a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar, due on December 21, caught many people as proof that the end of the world was coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call “the debt Armageddon,” and the growing conflict in which Israel is drawn, the place where, according to Christians theorizing about the end of the world, the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charme told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When we discuss what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for the apocalyptic mind.
And this is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker holds a course on "Means, Culture, and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We discuss why these ideas expand over time,” he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that drive certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, students are analyzing films with apocalyptic themes and exploring how they differ from real-life examples.
“I’ve been trying to inform students about what’s possible, probable, believable, and impossible,” says Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, came together to organize a course with the simple title The End of the World.
"We don't connect '2012' because we always count on the possibility of re-arranging the course if the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "threatening doom," students must study, create projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work "just until the evening of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"It stretched out into two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, 35 of whom applied.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails asking if there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
Thus, apocalyptic, worldly, or religious thinking is only a matter of consolation or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a class before in which it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no student interviewed, let alone a professor, said he believed in the end date of December 21.
“Our first project was about the Mayan prediction, and in a way, we’re refuting it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back several centuries as people react to changes in their surroundings by predicting the end of the world.
This speculation is caused by the internet.
“Otherwise people don’t think about it,” he said.
This happens in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who lectures in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew of a course there on “the end of the world.”
"Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at an exception at the highest office.
We have mercy on the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will perish.
Dates are taken lightly by both students and professors.
Several said they intend to go to the "end of the world" festivities.
“I think I’m going to call a few friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
