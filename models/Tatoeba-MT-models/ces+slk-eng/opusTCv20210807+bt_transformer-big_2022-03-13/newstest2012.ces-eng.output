Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
Ukraine’s parliament has rejected a proposal to repeal a section of the criminal code that convicted opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment, which would pave the way for the release of the imprisoned former prime minister, was rejected by MPs at the second reading of the proposal to commute sentences for economic crimes.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly disadvantageous contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not final, the appeal of the convicted person is due to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko called the verdict a political vendetta against the regime, and suspicions of bias prompted the trial in the West.
The proposal to remove Section 365 from the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the former prime minister was convicted, was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
It took 226 votes to pass.
The Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists win elections, but the question is whether moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed up to customary Sharia law, and we already have some idea about it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the hand is cut for theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates are awaiting execution and so on.
Instead of being a dictator, a society made up of rival tribes will unify the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we certainly would not want.
But our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and would probably not suit the Libyans just mentioned for a change.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic fighters have grudgingly taken help from infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that, from their point of view, the NATO airstrikes were conducted not by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated with every successful intervention.
So when the winners are sought in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in a shootout, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of a dictator, got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
There is no problem with the "crusades".
But will they have Libya’s black gold as a mouthpiece without the occupation of the oil company?
They may not be, and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
Unless those sharia law buffs get in the way.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the spotlight.
A statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries published GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy stagnated quarter-on-quarter, while Germany and France grew.
Today, the bond market is breaking records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published preliminary estimates of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany performed better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), but France said it appeared in a slight decline of 0.1% (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter.
However, gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated on a quarter-on-quarter basis, confirming the trend of gradual deceleration in economic performance growth, according to the CZSO.
The results are worse than analysts’ estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated in quarter-on-quarter terms.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data.
The economy of both the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy fell 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical levels.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech 10-year bond yields remain below 4%, even as the situation in the region worsens.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be a lender of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
In Montenegro won 1:0 and celebrated the advance for 200 million
The football team managed the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to a great Czech and a beautiful goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0.
Czech football, with a great portion of luck in the second half, has maintained a luxurious lead from the domestic rematch and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz followed the progress match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to the domestic defeat in the final, the great Czech and the hero Jiráček, won 1-0 happily in Montenegro and celebrated their promotion to the European Championship.
The Montenegrins were under pressure in the second half due to the precise defence of the Czech team.
The losers of the match became Damjanovic with Vucinič, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and a reward of about 200 million crowns will be added to the national football pool.
A lot of football has been played since the first few minutes.
Both teams had a hard time getting involved in the combination and were playing mostly around the half-line.
The pressure of the domestic footballers did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense precisely averted the long kicks for defense.
Iranian students are prepared to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a shield.
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program against a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the building at noon on Tuesday and then called for the deaths of the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, created a live shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center on Tuesday, where uranium is being processed.
They show that they are ready to defend the nuclear program of their countries with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a recent report that Iran did not seem to have stopped pursuing a nuclear weapon.
There is talk of a possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then called for the deaths of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack designed to cripple Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press says the enrichment facility at Natanz would be targeted in addition to the Isfahan facility.
Diet of an obese child: does not eat breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with being overweight, with 9% of schoolchildren being overweight, and 5% of children being obese.
Obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to a recent survey.
Again, it shows how important the environment in which a person grows up and the patterns with which he is surrounded are for healthy development.
For example, sausages appear on the tables of obese children up to half as often as in families of children with normal weight.
Fried fries had dinner the day before the research related to the awareness-raising event called Obesity is no coincidence more than 19 percent of obese.
In fat families, it is also not customary to play sports, but this applies to most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children responded that their parents find time to exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of the Obesity is Not a Coincidence event, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 pupils from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
Eating right and getting enough exercise in the family is one of the determinants of dramatically increasing numbers of children who are overweight or even obese.
“For example, only half of those surveyed reported eating breakfast-lunch-lunch-dinner-five times a day, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition,” reads one of the survey results.
Without breakfast and evening sausage
Experts point out that relative details, such as regular family breakfast times, are also essential for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren’s families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing is that 10 percent of households don’t eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that families of obese children are much more likely to eat unhealthy fries.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
More than 40 percent of children regularly play sports, but the result for their parents was less than half - 15 percent.
Assemble your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own diet according to their own tastes and opinions.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of floury, meaty and sweet dishes.
"The great popularity of sugary lemonades is particularly alarming," the survey's final report said.
For lunch, pasta won over poultry.
But the children practically did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and midday vegetable dishes is also low.
Move to health
The research also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"The control group of survey participants who filled out the questionnaire after the end of the education lecture Obesity is not a coincidence, in a number of cases there was a significant shift of preferences towards the principles of healthy diet," the results of the project say.
This was especially true with sweet lemonades, where more children would start to prefer plain water.
Children were also much more likely to check poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and would cut back on sweet foods and dumplings.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I complained a little bit that there was already a lot in the introductory lessons.
I had no idea what was coming next.
Lectures of three professionals from the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on the set.
And it gets worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "footstepped".
This time we discussed with the director Alice (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And those are the vast majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure without proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually soften the broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We were given tips, such as for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, to emphasize the figure nicely and at the same time not dress the woman too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirts or pants really do not fit, then it is worth having at least one such piece tailor-made.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
In a tailored skirt you will feel much better than in one that constantly shifts, rolls up, stays in the waist and so on.
The boy figure can also afford to wear clothes with creases, applications, embroidery or scooping.
Of course, there is a lot of such information and types of characters, so I am glad that I have a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still worried that given the homework assignment, it's too much.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity, who has to come up with two outfits: daytime and evening.
We have to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the person and the type of character.
I'll "dress" Miranda Kerr, you may know her from Victoria's Secret campaigns.
I’m cheering, for me personally definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained maybe a hundred pounds (please take into account exaggeration), or young Selena Gomez.
Clothes must be cut from magazines or searched on the Internet and printed and then graphically processed.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, then express our personal style and relationship to graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific assignments, such as trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture packed with information about the types of characters was enriched by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a handy stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is key in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or, if you want, originally a trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt as a coat, but you can also dress it on a bare body, put on pumps and take pictures as a dress.
Or just roll up your sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
“Play with it,” he emphasized.
But what I appreciated the most was the following advice: "To work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can start breaking them," said Jacob.
Finally, I understand why we are crushing all the precepts, what to combine with, what to do, why, when we sometimes see something else in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist has to have many more variants of clothes prepared than how many of them can be photographed.
So in a fashion story that has ten pages (ten outfits), I have to be ready to “steal” at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo clothes look and work in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
This is what we need to consider when creating an outfit.
Honza Pokorný confirmed to us that image and style makes sometimes up to half of success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miracle singer, but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists is rather cold.
Even the familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (it is enough that I know something, the way I look is secondary).
And if someone lets us create styling, then we should count on the fact that he will most likely dictate to us a completely different (smaller) size than he really should.
Then you have to Google and see if the tabloids did not write about the fact that the celebrity has become fat / thin and so on.
On Sunday, both Jan and Mario told us that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and to be able to put together an outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Being able to guess people, not pandering, standing up for your opinion.
"If a manager orders you to sort through her closet and complete it with nice pieces, you can't just throw out the whole closet and say, 'Oh, my God, that's terrible.'"
“Find at least a few things to compliment and recommend what they can be worn for,” says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called "placovka", or bag for the set, must contain.
It's the one you put around your waist and have all the props you need.
In addition to bright things such as scissors, hair roller or safety pins, there is also a nylon thread (with it the stylist helps to take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips that we clip on the back of clothes if it is larger (a pin or other clamp is not allowed, it would damage the garment), or a sew-on.
In order not only not to listen, but also to practically try something, we learned how to properly fit shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio where there is a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
The shoes must not be touched with scissors so that they do not accidentally get damaged.
So there is a real need for skill.
Mario delighted me when he praised my creation without reservation.
This skill is not really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard on the second weekend of the course.
It is becoming more and more clear to me that it is really not a walk in the park, no matter who wants what.
Need for Speed: The Run is a race across America.
Reviews
Originally carefree driving due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes turns into a routine morning trip on the shift.
The ambition was largely achieved, but it is of no use if no one clearly wanted to do anything extra.
The new episode with the subtitle The Run raised high expectations before its release.
He promised that the long-running Need for Speed racing series would once again take a piece in a new direction, and from playable demonstrations appeared as a game that would not be in the genre of action racing only to the number.
We were also curious how the inserted passages will turn out, in which the main character gets out of the car and runs on his own.
However, as usual with the NFS series, many things are a bit different than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down a few unnecessary mistakes that have appeared in the series more or less for several years.
So these are not actually mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal nature and as a solution offers to participate in an illegal race across America.
Get behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings with it some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
It doesn’t feel like the game is always offering the same thing.
Some of the environments are also very nice to look at, even though the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not world-class.
But driving through the desert, autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains looks visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are enriched from time to time by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you have to be careful not to be covered by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are quite well planted.
There are only a few, but that’s enough.
For a while you are trying to overtake the required number of opponents (essentially a classic race), then you are catching up time (classic fight with stopwatch) and then you have a duel with a single opponent.
From time to time, the police will also get involved, which further complicates all your efforts.
There are also passages outside the car.
Rather, it is just such interactive animations, when Jack usually flees from someone and you have to help him in this by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, though, these passages are far less in play than you might expect (perhaps even just three).
As a result, however, it is beneficial, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and in the context of the above, it ranks among the elements that diversify the game.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous parts.
This means that it is definitely not a thing anymore, but it can not be said that it would be a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more action-packed racing of this model is still quite good, even though we could find better ones in the competition.
So far, so good.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is no longer in order.
We do not expect this type of game to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea how your car will behave before hitting any object, then probably not everything is in order.
Typically, when overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic, sometimes you just lightly lick each other, but other times in almost identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even a straight shot.
Thanks to the system of reboots, it does not really matter, but it will detune you reliably.
Restarts are designed so that if you break down or go far off the track, the game will throw you back to the last clue on the track.
However, there are only five restarts available in each race.
When you run out of them, you have to start the race all over again.
This is more likely to help you if something goes wrong than if you rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even restarts do not help, only the need to learn the given section of the race by heart will solve them.
The big problem with the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit into them.
Other times you will meet the "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you can see your opponent pass easily between two cars in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
It does not matter when you arrive, because it is “counted” so that the situation always occurs just before your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
Throughout the game you will come across several places where you, again regardless of time, always overtake the same opponent in the same place.
Most of all, it hits the end of the game on the long bridge, where you are going in the opposite direction.
The enemy must get there in front of you, no matter what the cost.
When he drives in front of you, it makes your overview of oncoming cars worse, so you probably spread there a couple of times.
You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline, but the design is so obvious that it reliably quickly disgusts you.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and so much action in places that sometimes you can't quite keep track of what's flying.
And it doesn’t really matter whether it’s the concept with 50 unique tracks, shifting races so that boredom doesn’t have a chance or whatever.
An unusual idea is the exchange of cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gas pumps on the roads, because that's where you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you can do with what you currently have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars on straight highways and exotic supercars for technical riding, for example on winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are the races in the individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common to challenges and story.
Various items are unlocked to get a higher level of driver: from cars to profile backgrounds.
It is also linked to the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your achievements with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
Your car will take you to the subway tunnel (be), where you drive it in the dark on the tracks (be).
The speedometer flashes the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (be) and the subway comes from behind and crushes you uncompromisingly.
In the editorial office, we will probably have a few more days of discussion about whether nobody really thought a bit when creating the game, or whether the authors consider us really so big jerks.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in a few cases even great.
They get so frustrated that in some more tense moments the shooting decreases, and in some cases quite tragically.
But this is especially true for crashes with a larger number of participants, when smooth shooting would not be useful for you anyway.
The sound is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to the widest range of rather younger audiences, the soundtrack from the category "every dog different village" was created, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, no one will buy the game.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so very self-conscious.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work of NFS in the last few years.
But this is how the game works.
Fun is certainly fine, but be prepared for the fact that mistakes will hit you in the eye with the power of airport spotlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly upset the balance between the various institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five or six years for the situation to settle down a bit and for all players to get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová said.
Insofar as she takes her motto "Comprehensively and openly about Europe" seriously, she showed in the first part of the lecture that she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University might envy her.
Vice-President Van Rompuy also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that he was a lackluster, that he was a gray official, that he could not perform any role, and I must say that everyone was blown away by the fact that he performed that role very well."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate with them very well and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
She then explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: "Who is this European Union? To which phone number should I call?", a significant step towards unification and greater readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban cheese.
Vicenová also addressed the agenda that the European Council lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency was a success.
The Czechs solved the coming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time was described as a major negative, which damaged the Czech Republic very badly.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, the 'frank' was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being addressed today.
Moreover, the new seven-year budget of the Union still needs to be approved, which is becoming much more complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and economical, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which less is all on the agenda for the next negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe clearly".
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, slurs that nobody understands.
How is the citizen to understand that in Brussels there are really no curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone really has to ban us from cheeses?"
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
We have a multi-speed Europe.
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than positive aspects of the matter.
Moreover, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, many factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come up to me and a Slovak comes up, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what's going on there, what's your Visegrad Four doing?' and he doesn't look excited about it at all."
In the future, the EU will face tough new rules on member states’ budgetary policies.
He sees as very real the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European Federation."
“We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area, we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that don't want to stay away."
“There will be more institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe,” she said.
In this regard, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues affecting the whole Union should be discussed between all Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to search for a word that most accurately conveys IBM's strategy, the closest would probably be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is perceived as very contemporary, and yet a hundred years have passed since its founding.
The foundation of this long-term business was laid by the company’s first boss, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the slogan that many of the world’s problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of the internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous movement toward the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a century because it remained true to its core values while not being afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the second hundred,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current CEO.
Sophisticated system
In the 1930s, Watson took a similar approach to caring for his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - people from IBM were among the first American employees to have paid holidays, insurance from an employer, plus an elegant employee uniform and an elaborate system for rewarding the best inventors and businessmen.
IBM has a long-standing relationship with its customers.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant at extracting talent - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisan to be replaced next year by a woman named Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years and is still the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called pits, online brainstorming, from which arise many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there are so many people working in the company.
Institutions with a good name
Firm position in the business is ensured by its strong internal and external image.
"Since the beginning, IBM has had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," Harvard Business School professor and IBM author Rosabeth Moss Kanter told The Economist.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM -- or "Big Blue," as it's called in the United States because of its logo -- has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a century.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any U.S. technology company, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, an ATM, a payment card, a financial swap, a bar code or a floppy disk.
IBM, with about $220 billion, became the second-largest technology firm by market capitalization this year (the first being Apple) when it surpassed Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Forward View
Not all products and innovations fit the tastes of customers and times - IBM, for example, failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online services Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t emotionally tie yourself to the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano notes.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundation on many platforms - and when they don't work, abandon them.
Unlike Microsoft, which basically stands or falls on the Windows operating system.
The Prospective Technology
IBM services are the largest contributor to revenue, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth of the revenue.
Even in 1990, with more than half the share, it was the strongest representative of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yield assets, during which time it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technology.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time.
IBM is acting on the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be going through the current crisis intact.
IBM’s share price has risen by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, and the company’s net profit has been growing steadily.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything but your values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will manage it.
IBM History: From Cheese Slicer to Space Flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, originally with the complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The IBM name was adopted in 1924 and was originally used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The merger of four companies dates back to the 1880s.
They owned technologies such as the famous "crackles," that is, clocks recording the employee's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new firm was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the firm's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired rival firm head Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built on invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from meat and cheese slicers to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson’s leadership, the company doubled its turnover to $9 million and began a large-scale expansion to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that his son, Thomas Watson Junior, succeeded him after nearly forty years in the boss’s chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly into space - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous manned flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "care" that set the computer standard at the time, called the IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer manufacturing to Chinese company Lenovo, bought consulting arm PricewaterhouseCoopers, and became fully engaged in consulting and high-value-added services.
The strategy that has paid off over the past three years is the concept of a Smarter Planet.
Its aim is the smart use of technologies in previously unplanned areas and the improvement of the situation, for example, in transport or city administration.
For business, IBM recently introduced a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps merchants manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history at home.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM Czech Republic, it also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
About the Unfaithful Husband:
Iveta, keep the donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also the lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now she is not going to wait and set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová gave Bartoš asylum in her home in the summer, she probably did not dream how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved out of Říčany after her insistence after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even admitted publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, came to terms with her husband's relationship, and now she's even said goodbye to him forever.
A man doesn’t care who his wife sleeps with.
If Bartošová and Rychtář were to break up once again, his wife’s open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live out his life in our common home, no one will expel him."
"But he will live not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová said, adding that she has already broken away from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't mind Darina closing his back door.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and I'm not going to change it."
"My wife set up a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I shop."
"We talk to Darina quite normally, except that we don't share a bed," Rychtář said.
If she finds a new love, she won’t let it stop her.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, or if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility," concluded Josef.
The Worst Female Habits: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men if they can list some typical female bad habits, they usually all roll them out of their sleeves very quickly.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where there are several female bad habits that can perfectly pump the blood in the veins of men?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like shopping and bulk in discounts?
Then, in your case, you can refer to shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least curb their passion for shopping.
But tell me, who could resist just walking around the clothing stores, looking for well-fitting uppers and then trying them all (ideally in different colors) in the cabin?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told your wife to wait for you at the front door...
Unsatisfied constantly
“Am I too fat?”
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Do these phrases remind you of anything?
Right?
Then you are one of those women who is obsessed with the way they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to their partners complaining about their appearance all the time.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless merry-go-round.
Washing windows, vacuuming, wiping tiles, dusting, scrubbing the bath - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping with his dirty foot on a clean pavement, the children for soiling a scrubbed sink and covering a glass living room wall that you have worked so hard to polish?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to remember that nothing should be exaggerated, and order and cleanliness should definitely not come first within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Sniffing
"Throw those used shorts in the trash."
“Are you going to wear those socks tomorrow?”
"A wet towel doesn't belong on the floor."
If you poke your partner like that several times a day, know that you can reliably dial it.
Of course, you don’t mean anything wrong, you want everything to be okay.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to dig up so much...
Blaming, gossiping
For some women, slander, gossip, but also insulting and conspiring against someone are also inherent.
Women are relationship oriented, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
I hope every one of us drops a little harmless rumor or gossip here and there.
Hand on heart, it's common to all women.
The opposite, however, are the gossip of the coarsest grain, which likes and often gossips, perhaps everyone despises and is especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the female working team.
Jagr and Voracek helped to win Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jágr participated in Monday's NHL game with two assists to win the Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina ice and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
The 39-year-old star was backed by Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was named the best player of the match.
Two assists in the match were also recorded by Jagr's teammate Jakub Voráček.
Jagr told reporters after the match that he had predicted a big night for Giroux.
“I told him before the game that he was going to get a hat trick.”
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get that feeling," Jagr explained, after which Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
Moments later, the second hit of the team also had a Czech footprint.
Voráček fought a disc behind the Hurricanes' goal and presented it between the rings to the scoring Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first break was reduced in the weakening by home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Especially Giroux.
After working with Jagr, he scored the third goal, then his shot remelted flowing in the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely in the top three,” Jagr said.
"I never thought I'd be playing with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
“I want to play him.”
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning," Jagr said.
Carolina made a drama out of the match, with a goal by Tuoma Ruutu and again by Dwyer, who made it out of the penalty shootout, she got on the difference of one goal.
However, Matt Read did not make any further complications, finishing with a two-on-one score.
"He made an excellent hit in our Pronger zone."
"He put the disc out, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to a more distant pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Špaček did not make the match against Buffalo, he withdrew in the second period due to an injury in the upper body.
The Candiens lost a two-goal lead in addition to the experienced beka and lost after a 2:3 penalty shoot-out.
One of their raids did not transform Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach rather than the lost points was resented by an extensive sickbed back row, with the match only finishing to five defenders.
"It's bad."
"We only played with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's just nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The shift after shift was coming down on us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have made the game easier, moving the puck out of our band."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defenders of P. K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty hits to Winnipeg to win 5:2 over Tampa Bay.
The goals of the Jets, who broke the five-game losing streak, were shared by five different scorers.
How prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time were selling mostly only tours to socialist bloc countries, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled to the GDR (Democratic Republic of Germany), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea by the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when the possibility to travel to Yugoslavia was also, however, then the Yugoslav regime inclined towards the West and the travels of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to stand in line overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" in the travel agency.
However, it was not won either.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without the foreign exchange pledge it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) to travel to the West.
However, by far the most frequent holidays were spent in the Czech Republic, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages, which the Czechs acquired and this custom survives to this day.
Czechs have experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which we are no longer aware of, is that it was not possible for us to travel to the most popular Croatia until 1989, as it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, visa requirements for neighboring Western European countries were lifted, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits, mainly to Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there at least for a while.
In Paris, for example, tours of Czechs slept in tents in parks, as our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czech travel at this time was bringing your own food, canned food, salami, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech koruna, which allowed our tourists to finally buy Western currency after many decades.
However, our standard of living and, with it, average salaries rose, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to regularly prepare charter flights since 1997, which has made air tours incredibly cheaper compared to the past thanks to the possibility of arranging quantity discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs had already had visa-free access to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the USA, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to Thailand was dispatched from the Czech Republic due to considerable demand.
Since this year, Czech tourists have been flying direct charters to warm faraway countries every year, this winter they will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. canceled visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time ever, Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%), and for the first time in history, they spent more than CZK 15,000 per person on one foreign vacation, including the cost of staying there.
The General Assembly has to find the President, but again there is a threat of a stalemate.
Czech football has been without a chairman for almost five months and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on which electoral procedure to follow.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
However, in the post-Hasek era, football slipped back to the splits between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was revealed on September 16, when the new president was to be chosen.
Delegates of the general meeting gathered in the National House in Prague in Smíchov unnecessarily, because the meeting remained blocked and it was not just a way of choosing.
There was also no agreement as to who had the right to vote at the meeting - whether only statutory representatives or even officials authorized by the power of attorney.
There has been a partial agreement on this single point since then, helped by the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the Law, according to which representation on the basis of power of attorney is not possible.
There is still controversy over the electoral system.
Nor has the Executive Committee brought too much clarity into the situation, which is no longer dealing with anything else at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to rule out the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the FAČR's three vice-chairmen, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the proposed model, the third round will be won by one of the candidates who will have a greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running.
Moravia is reportedly willing to make concessions in order to win a candidate who gets a higher sum of the percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side enforces the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds advantage in this percentage.
"But that would then make no sense in the two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian Svoboda party, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and vote according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, even Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even though it is estimated that the electoral order determined by the statutes suits Pelt the most of all candidates.
“I want to be able to vote as much as possible.”
"In order not to invent any representative nonsense like at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his statements was mainly against Pelt.
Pelta is optimistic.
In Nymburk, he said, the new president will be known and believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All the passions will calm down if today's national team progresses to the European Championship."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate," said Jablonec official, who has the greatest experience in managing football at both the professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I'm hoping for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided."
"It's not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to purposefully adjust the regulations."
"This may cause the general meeting to be blocked again."
"But I hope common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football general will be complete until the match.
The flight special, in which Vice-Chairmen Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were supposed to travel to Podgorica, did not leave Prague due to a technical failure this morning, and a replacement option was being sought to bring part of the Executive Committee to the scene of the rematch.
In the end, a ministerial-level meeting may be decisive, which may allegedly take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to bring the divided parties within the country’s strongest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football, and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
He's fighting for the presidency because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If the head of Plzeň football players, Tomáš Paclík, saw a strong candidate in front of the extraordinary general meeting who would meet all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not even join the fight for the top position.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and not go to the polls."
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such a person," Paclík told the Czech Press Agency.
In a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclík is motivated to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favourite of the elections, from leading the FAČR.
Paclík also points out that if he wins, he would only stay in the role of chairman until 2013, when a regular general meeting is on the agenda.
In office, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not very connected with football.
"I've spoken to some people who would come into consideration."
"It was crazy for me when some people said they didn't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment."
“I would like to change that view,” he said.
Paclík is now most annoyed by Pelt's association with the chairman of the Plzeň Regional Football Association, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to stand in the chair.
"If he had won, the current situation would have been preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a skilled trader, it would not benefit football even more," Paclík said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelta’s name was heard years ago during an investigation into a corruption affair, but Pelta came out unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring."
“And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,” Paclík said, adding that he was already taking a deep breath when he said he would “sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman.”
However, if Paclík had won Thursday’s election, he would have been able to imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco, also thinks the same way.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the team."
"But he couldn't manage the association managerially."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who attracted a lot of attention in September by standing up for the dismissal of the panel of judges headed by Luděk Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík says he would dare to lead the association.
He appeals to his ability to manage private companies, and since last summer he has also headed Pilsen, which celebrated its premier league triumph with his support in May.
“I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment, to contribute to a certain kind of cultivation.”
"To limit the influence of some interest groups that, for example, tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals committee, which goes to disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
He would also consider one of the priorities to strengthen the FACR’s relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"This is one of the key things that the new president should address."
"If there is a tax on gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to say where the money will go," he said.
Paclík does not even take his connection with the Pilsen club as a burden, even though he himself claims that the FAČR chairman should be "super-party".
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the point in transferring my shares to someone in the Pilsen club and going back there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta has promised new FAČR statutes to rule out the electoral stalemate
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for president, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would push for the FAČR to have new statutes that would definitively rule out disputes over the electoral rules in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly dampen any possible success of today's football team.
Pelta had already promised before the election in September that he would focus on representation and fundraising if elected.
He decided to go to the last minute before the election, so he could use a two-month postponement to defend his ideas about managing football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been making football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time for someone to lead the association," said the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who has served on Sparta and the executive committee of the association for many years.
He believes he has enough experience to be able to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed during Ivan Hašek’s reign is behind the current problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the June general meeting, statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they do not allow different interpretations, we have had the chairman since September," Pelta said.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civic association that he conceived as a decoy for delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if I fail to do so."
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," Pelta says.
He says he’s not trying to outplay his rivals.
He has previously stated that he can imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Tomáš Paclík, who, on the contrary, did not leave a dry thread on Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year, he's had some success.
"But his attacks were undignified, and a lot of people were caught off guard by the way he campaigned."
"That's why many of them are now doubting his true character," Pelt said, remaining faithful to the proclamations he announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
That should be the showcase of football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs, starting with the Bohemians scandal or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately jump into negotiations with the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old told the Czech Press Agency two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the head of football would mean no personnel purges.
"I would first have to get acquainted with the content of individual employees," he said, referring to Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness from a long period of ungovernance.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk in vain on Thursday.
“If the only issue is how to vote in the third round, then we can move on.”
“Football needs credibility, and the only way it will gain credibility is to finally have a leader again,” Pelta said two days before his career day.
Rajchl promises that under him the FAČR would start working hard
If Jindřich Rajchl had been elected the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday's general meeting, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will work hard.
He wants to push for systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for the individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by the previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football to youth."
"I'm not saying that I would do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with the Czech News Agency.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute the competencies on the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to a specific area."
"And I'm going to be giving out tough assignments to move football one mile ahead in each of these segments."
"It probably wouldn't make a lot of people happy, because it would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering not running again.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it's going to make sense and that I won't have people behind me constantly throwing sticks at me and questioning my every move," he explained.
"But a lot of people told me I couldn't give up because then others would."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated to continue the work he started with Haskem.
"There's been a lot of work done in those two years, and I don't want to throw it away right now."
"There are processes that will reverberate in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation on the union could return to the time before Hašek.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"There are people behind him who would make football so that it would only be for the chosen ones."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but it's certainly not that I'm siding with anyone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will be well, not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also denied that he was just the president of the United States.
"Although some people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the first league."
"This would not be the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsen club, was also involved in the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-chairman and sees that there are clear achievements behind me," said Rajchl, who considers his achievements to be saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lottery law.
Rather, he is complicit in the fact that the union does not pull together.
While he says Pelt is “disqualified” from returning confidence to Czech football, Paclík sees the latter as a strong candidate with something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job in Pilsen this year."
"If he had been elected, he would perhaps have continued with the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not have fundamentally changed the staffing in the commissions."
"He would not want to twist it in his favor," Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the blue
Julia Stanek
Paddling pool from Ufona’s point of view, a sumptuous pool in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonder - and after exploring the cities or traveling let their tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show you where the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a journey of discovery for the past one and a half years, her luggage was not to be missed: her bathing suit.
Lying on the water, she looked up at the artistically shaped domes, swam across from the marble putti (figures of a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her at the edge of the pool, admiring the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she immediately took it into her notebook - with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the architecture historian Meder and are now presented in her just published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing) ": Folk Swimming Pools in Munich, Historical Palaces of Swimming Pools in the Black Forest,"The Hard Core of Concrete Structures" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The Way behind the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
It's not too much with sports, says Meder - just in the water it's something else.
The only thing to be enraged about is that swimming fans have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
“One day I asked why swimming pools must always be so ugly,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started to collect nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles the architecture
Splashing in the diving pool and essential oils for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of the floor, a person has a water surface in the baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically duplicated: high vault, colorful stoves, diving boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing)" provides 190 pages of everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of historical oases of wellnes - but above all it arouses the desire to jump into the blue.
Notable specimens were discovered by swimming pool collector Mrs. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to beautiful healing baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, the thermal baths, which are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálferda in Jászberény), have found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (the cave baths in Miskolc-Tapolca).
In contrast, many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a wonderful sight. While one has the whole city in view from the Zurich rooftop swimming pool, one can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton - and: In the steam baths there is a window from which one can watch the hustle and bustle of the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most striking design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: the Aquapark ätztal looks like an UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From the three open basins, steam rises in the winter, while in the background of the Otztal mountain rises to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did pool collector Mrs. Meder smell of chlorine in his nostrils.
Many thermal baths are smelled of sulfur, in the spa Árpád in Hungarian Békescsaba it smells of heating oil to such an extent that one can hardly believe that he got to the healing spa.
The smell comes from a healing water containing alkaline bicarbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as one just slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, one place Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902, the spa designed by architect Dušan Jurkovič was closed.
As Mrs. Meder gazed through the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds growing rapidly between the tiles.
On the other hand, they stood out in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already undergone three phases of construction; one can discover not only the Neo-Romanesque elements that date back to the time of its creation in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, which was attached around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a favourite spa resort of the pool expert Mrs. Iris Meder, and not only because she comes from the Black Forest.
“It’s already a feat to combine such a variety of architectural styles into such a beautiful complex,” says Ms. Meder.
At such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is apparently a marginal affair.
Agrarian Speculation
Deutsche Bank to Investigate Commodity Trading
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank abandoning its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a task force to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the head of the company wants to draw consequences from this.
Hamburg - Hotel
For federal citizens, the thing is clear: 84% of Germans find it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of those surveyed are even demanding that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit the deal as it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa poll commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives up prices and the banks are therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The campaign is specifically aimed at Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, although big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also acting similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that capital market participants interested in high-risk trades have broken away from supply and demand - and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Other than competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to scrutinize the criticisms, saying that no deal "is not worth putting Deutsche Bank's reputation on the line".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is reviewing complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The review is due to close by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank's board of directors - along with a recommendation on how this should be handled.
At the end of January, the bank will announce what the consequences will be.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his own image.
Thilo Bode, president of Foodwatch, said: “Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are harming the common good today.
Let Ackermann, as the highest bank lobbyist, do his duty.
“Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items where money is used to bet on food prices,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Ackermann’s insight seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that he would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board, otherwise than planned, would not move to the Supervisory Board.
By turning away from questionable agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he does not have to worry about possible losses - that should be dealt with by his successor in the end.
Every second investment in raw materials would prove
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a poll in which the Forsa Institute polled 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just 11 percent consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer food-price-related investments.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: Every second would, as a result of the survey, terminate all investments where money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43% would warn acquaintances about such a bank, 49% said they would think about terminating their account and move on to another institution.
21st Century House in Vienna
The Relocated Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with its peaks, falls and happy ending: the Austrian pavilion from the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and abandoned.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
When he is passionate about modern post-war architecture, bright forms, glass halls, bold expansions and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is an apt and famous example for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
Schwanzer's pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and airy-looking steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion during the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus as a key made by a side building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its temporary exhibition building designed after the world exhibition was placed in the Schweizer Garten near the Vienna's Southbahnhof (South Railway Station), renovated and in 1962 opened the Museum of the 20th Century - it was named the "House of the 20th Century".
The building was not suitable for the museum, either spatially or technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Still, it was used until contemporary art saw a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and decaying more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated the pavilion, it now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open the first exhibition there - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Belvedere Gallery in Austria in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a graduated art historian with a distinguished career, including a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, vigorously promoted reconstruction with politicians and conservationists, procured public funds and private sponsorship money, and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by an eponymous foundation, a café and bookstore should be created, and an office building must be built to do so.
Tight supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was then the ideal cast to perform.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna with Schwanzer and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him to view exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it was relocated to Vienna and changed its use.
There were much bigger problems with the current reconstruction: the building was a “energy catalyst”, says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade have been replaced, glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass has been used, and the glass roof has been replaced with a special safety glass.
Cool bridges-steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been sanitized.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a lofty Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown color tone.
The cinema is exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument office and low budget.
“Often material had to be found that was good and cheap, and also liked the monument office,” says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was said to have been difficult with the pavilion "that came here from Brussels", Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history", said recently.
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and wants to "wake up proper self-confidence".
In this case, however, the 21st century house is not in an inappropriate place, as an urban happy accident has occurred: a completely new designed "City Quarter by the Main Station" with office and residential buildings is being created in the circle around Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps there will be another lucky coincidence: The 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, since collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already negotiating with the city about a neighborhood at a post in Schweizer Garten.
The railway is planning a package for the winter crisis in the amount of millions
The railway has launched a crisis plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees has to be doubled.
That's gonna cost millions.
In the fight against cold caused by train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional 70 million euros this year, according to a report in the newspaper.
The newspaper "Bild" reported provisionally, citing an internal corporate plan, that a total investment of about 300 million euros is expected by 2015.
It is supposed to improve the use of trains and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the platform by the start of operation and 90 percent to operate the necessary switches within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Rudiger Grube, head of railways, warned of train outages and delays during this winter after meeting at the highest level with government and industry officials.
In the past winter, the railway had significant problems in passenger transport, because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions, it had a lack of reserves.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the dispatching of ICE trains.
For years, the track has also been unable to cope with the fact that the axles of ICE trains are likely to be checked more frequently by a workshop when an ICE train at K ln Central Station has been destroyed.
Deutsche Bank to pay $1 million fine in the US
After the commotion around the boss Josef Ackermann, there are new troubles in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million-dollar compensation there.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, the giant in the industry has yet to catch up with its past in the US: the Frankfurt institution is paying $145 million (106 million euros) in one settlement to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is a sale of mortgages.
The regulator of the NCUA financial market reproaches a number of large banks for misleading cooperative banks into buying financial products; that they have probably reduced the risks.
Such papers lost considerably in value during the crisis and pushed banks into the abyss with them.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without having to drag the parties to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt in the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chair Debbie Matz welcomed the friendliness of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the U.S. and assists with bankruptcy cases to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to recover billions of dollars in damages.
Now completed, the settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clamped down on other big banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Mortgage-backed securities are called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, it became fatal for many financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Even though the events happened a few years ago, the banks are now facing a strong wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits in order to obtain redress or to penalize misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 large international banks of putting two state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at a disadvantage in mortgage deals of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a lawsuit from the FHFA, which includes more deals totaling about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be liable for "substantial losses" without, however, providing any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
Warren Buffett has always said that he will not invest in IT and computers because it is difficult to predict the long-term development of companies.
Now, however, he has read IBM's business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
Much earlier he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for the IT-department of other businesses.
Warren Buffett’s investment is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, IBM's mother rock IT can now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he had bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM stock since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment holding became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM didn’t know anything about his involvement.
He praised the management, which during the economic crisis even sought proper returns.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services such as computing center operations.
The more than 100-year-old pioneer of computers also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to this day.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight railroad, the lubricant manufacturer, or the machine manufacturers.
In addition to some 80 of its own subsidiaries, its Berkshire Hathaway Holding also owns stakes in a number of large companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, formerly the Munich Group.
An 81-year-old man took over a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, making it one of the world’s most valuable businesses with wise investments.
His way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha."
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's shares rose by one percent before the stock market opened.
The Big Blue, as IBM is also known, is worth more than $220 billion and is considered to be the most valuable technology company in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to play.
Bill Gates is a close friend of his.
The threat is tangible.
After the revelations of the "Cells in Zwickau", the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
The newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
The news was met with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, this brings back a specter that has long been thought dead: since the arson attacks in Muelln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
That there was xenophobia in Germany, however, was never in doubt.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a scale whose dimension is long out of sight.
"Is bloody ideology coming back to life?" headlined the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the Department for the Protection of the Constitution and fears that German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany responded with prudence: It recalled the weekend of demonstrations in silence in front of the Brandenburg Gate of the victim of racist violence.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
The coverage of several Turkish media outlets acts as a checklist: "Germany's 50th birthday present" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murderous series.
Also, the issue of the newspaper "Horriyet" for Germany can not be taken, so as not to carry out this thought connection.
"It's starting to stink", headlines a column by Ahmet Kolahci.
In it, he points out that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
Most critically discussed in German-Turkish Internet forums is the police's progress and its late success in the search.
Why it didn’t occur to German authorities much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are shown at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If the activity continues here so superficially, the immigrants will have nothing left but their own defense and armed."
"This will be the best self-defense".
"On the quality of clarification and proportionality of punishment of the entire network very strongly depends internal peace in Germany ", writes "Selen".
What it means if internal peace in Germany is threatened is made clear by the assassinations in Muelln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burning ground in Solingen is deeply engraved in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat and the Germans that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
However, the attacks made the Turks feel more reciprocal.
Don’t repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the assassinations was mainly criticized at the time: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Muelln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, Kinkel sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish state president, but allowed himself to be represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel at the funeral ceremony in Cologne - Kinkel then calculated in his speech what fees the local Turks gave.
It is as if the value of a man were measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current Turkish media coverage once again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local state law arrangement is.
In addition to seeking extensive clarification and re-evaluation of right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandal bank at Lake Zurich
Europe’s most adventurous bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered near-bankruptcy during the financial crisis, and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now some German's got to straighten it out.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, it became known in July 2013 that he would take on almost the same spectacular new job: the president of the board of directors of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber enjoyed publicly, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and making friendly comments to future colleagues.
"UBS's die achieved turnover".
"Looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gr?bel".
But by September, it was clear that things were going to be completely different.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and squandered around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS chief executive Oswald Groebel, not only a well-respected Swiss banker, had to leave.
The president of the UBS board has also been scalded since then - and everyone is asking: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already become known that Weber has been able to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
He will then take responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which has just once again proved that it deserves the title of 'Bank of the Biggest Scandals in Europe'.
Because UBS is huge -- until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager -- and it's been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will be spared by the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a quiet and solid, but also a cunning asset manager combines with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed on the one hand with $1.6 trillion more money affluent clients than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it has progressed as an investment bank to the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a longtime professor of banking at Zurich, tells us: “I always used UBS as a model for a good bank for my students back then.”
“From today’s perspective, you ask, ‘How could I have been so wrong?’”
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was clear for the first time that something had gone wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, who until now has been considered a highly intelligent and brilliant banker, resigned.
A few months later, he knew why he was gone.
The bank's investment division wasted subprime paper and had to write off billions.
To keep it going, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
But she did find investors, some of whom she’d recently turned a blind eye to: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore, and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that one didn’t even know its name.
But that was just the first hit.
Things got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to admit new billion losses, the president of the board Marcel Ospel, 2006 still the second highest-paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster ensued: UBS stood before the collapse of the financial crisis due to its misinvestment and had to be saved by the state.
Nationalbank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs in mandatory convertible bonds for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it was for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of Switzerland's economy (see figure).
“We couldn’t save UBS one more time,” says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and expressed willingness to release data of wealthy customers who, if possible, cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, it agreed to pay $780 million - including a penalty fee - in return for unauthorized profits from these deals.
This admitted to UBS more or less openly that it was helping to cut taxes.
At the same time, she lost what had always been her capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it was before.
This was followed by the resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board.
And an exodus of customers' money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in asset management for helping to cut taxes.
And just when it calmed down a little bit, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, here comes this unfortunate business anabasis: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it’s clear: Risk management in investment banking is probably still not working.
“The Adoboli case may have found that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz professor of finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a major German bank is also confident: “The problem with UBS is that it cannot control risk.”
Yet it was precisely the idea of prudence with which the Swiss bankers set out a long time ago to become the custodians of the world's great possessions: no too great risks, but security for money - from this side, too, the world collapsed again.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unshakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprungli for high-quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The position is classic.
The bank has its head office in Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry stores like Tiffany's can be found here among Switzerland's traditional shops like Sprängli pastry shops.
Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The reception hall of UBS is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside there are walls lined with marble, in front of them stand massive leather chairs, next to the logo of the bank a large rudder to the "sejf".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
However, the idea has sometimes been suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, according to the head of a small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not be read in the newspapers, he eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both big banks.
UBS has probably grown too much, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss have nothing to say about it.
"And if they did, they would have adapted to Anglo-Saxon ways long ago."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, bringing it high profits at first, and then disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the Subprime jungle as Schweizer Grossbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
“On Wednesday, the government coalition of a small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation,” writes Lukas Hässig in his book “Der UBS-Crash”.
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, have been approved by politicians to save a large bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see a problem in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks merged into a large corporation.
There was a bank that was already too big for a small Switzerland when it merged - and it kept growing.
It helped that the two different bank predecessors of UBS were complementary: one rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on wealth management and a poorer but internationally more heavily involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came in favour of a lot of money, with which they could spin a big roulette wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, chief executive officer of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffle, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the man driven by feelings around the stomach who has worked himself up from banking science."
But Ospel was said to have relied on Wuffli towards the end.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake at the end: “He probably thought his models were reality,” Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear that pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of executives at which Wuffli repeated the same slogan again and again: Topple Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It featured "League Tables", a waiting list that documents the success of the banks of the time.
In it, UBS tried to place itself at the very top.
She's already taken a few steps.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she took part in the game at the very top.
But the corporate advisers who have been commissioned point out one weakness: In international interest-rate business, in the bankers’ “Fixed Income” speech, there seems to be a large gap behind the largest banks.
UBS may have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close the gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that nearly cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its risk hedge fund have invested in Subprime’s US investments.
It developed into a powerful machine that repackaged securities into US mortgage loans and passed them on, while also retaining its own risks.
Even when other banks were looking for a way out.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there,” says bank expert Geiger.
How great is the euphoria, how deep the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS have become a catapult seat and are still swinging to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
They have to find a strategy for the bank, which all nearby business models have disappeared.
Geiger, a banking expert, already has an idea: an end to investment banking, a concentration on asset management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far.
But investment banking is on the decline, so much is now clear.
On Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was seen as merely a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly broke with its predecessor, Gruebel.
In the meantime, he has made a name for himself: he is to run UBS’s business in the long term, Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back on track in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats cut.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
However, he says publicly that he and his wife will find an apartment in Zurich first.
Next year.
Fear of a recession in Europe weighs on the U.S. stock market.
The impending recession in Europe has discouraged American investors from starting the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended striking effect.
The continent’s subdued industrial output has smothered hopes of stabilising the debt crisis.
The general facilitation of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Italian and Greek glass last week were thought to be half full, not half empty, but now problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, the financial values stood on the tickets of the sale.

The companies produced 2% less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
"We're not an island, we're an addict," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe is not likely to recover so quickly from the recession, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
Investment legend Warren Buffett confirmed this outlook: He told a CNBC interviewer that it may not yet be clear if Europe is strong enough to do everything possible to end the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too early for him to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned the decades-old principle and entered the American technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM strengthened the traditional company’s share price and allowed it to initially quote nearly one percent higher against the trend in the course of trading.

Intelligent crows are spreading in cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds": however, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of cities, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been part of the image of the city for centuries, yet in some municipalities there are complaints of pollution and noise caused by animals.
However, there is no such thing as "problem birds" yet.
Field ravens may no longer be driven out of cities, experts said at the first symposium on crows in Leer, East Africa.
There, experts from all over the federal territory discussed possible starting points.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
Conservationists also derived urban problems from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing and felling of typical trees for nesting birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are found in Soest, Westphalia, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer, among others.
There, the 2005 disputed project of mass killings of crows in the rural district generated negative headlines.
Critics have described trapping animals for birds and beating sticks as particularly brutal.
"Normal banishment, alarm, does not bring anything", so much found the urbanist and landscaper Werner Kluever of Leer.
Removing nests by spraying water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies cleave and divide into other places".
Scaring is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes, or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of expelling animals from sensitive residential areas and luring them to settle in other places is conceivable.
"Information board instead of chainsaws" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens for a completely different treatment of animals: "One shilling in the face we can best overcome with self-confidence."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Mrs. Jurgens co-founded the Ascherberg Educational Crow Trail, which provides information boards on the life of the highly intelligent field raven.
The project has since been accepted by tourists.
Also, on the criticism of the noise caused by birds, Mrs. Jurgens had her own opinion: "Here it is about every volume of communication, they have much to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: The field ravens not only use tools to reach the treat, but even make their own tools.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior on four field ravens as far as the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring the stones down to get to the moth’s larva.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In the vertical cylinders, the researchers placed a small container with a moth larva.
Birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
But the researchers put pieces of wire in there.
From them all four animals formed a hook, with which she used as a hook to hunt from the tube a container by the handle.
Three of the four field ravens even managed to do so with a hitch.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championships
The hopes of Bosniaks and Turks did not come to the cup.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland take part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won their last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in Play-off matches.
Led by the twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth appearance in a row at the European Championship after a 0-0 result.
The Czechs were fine in the rematch of the Play-off with the underdog Černá Hora result 1:0 (0:0), when the first match was a clear thing.
Neither did Croatia with 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland with 1:1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored more goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the Bundesliga Zvjezdan Misimovic turned penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) reduced twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was given a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia has already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal, the start was made to measure.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 metres into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities in long-range shooting and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not act in the first half hour, had their first clear chance in goaltender Edin Dzek.
Former Wolfsburu player from England at the head of the standing table of Manchester City placed the ball on the bottom edge of the crossbar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
In the end, the referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the centre.
After the intervention against Helder Postig in the Bosnian penal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.)
On the opposing side, Stark made a contentious penalty kick after the action of Fabio Coentra, which Misimovic confidently converted.
But after the break, the European vice-champion from 2004 cleared everything up with four hits.
Petr Jiracek ended his last doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
With this, the 1976 European Champion leaves for the fifth time in a row for the European Championship.
The team of coach Michal Bilk with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second at the initial stage.
Goaltender Petr Čech prevented Tomáš Sivok’s own goaltender (9th) from reflecting at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from a turn from the penalty area border just around Čech's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already knocked down goalie of Czechs of the world class, again the striker FC Soul (50.).
In the end, Branka clarified everything.
At that moment, Turkey missed the football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not exceed 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly needs to free up his seat in the third round of the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians can rejoice in their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fabulous start.
Selcuk Inan hit only a pole in the seventh minute with a shot from a distance, the striker Kazim also could not hang the bounced ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, however, Croatia was increasingly taking control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not get the goal.
In addition to VfL Wolfsburg's Mario Mandzukic, who had been releasing Dortmund's Ivan Perisic since the 62nd minute, were also legionnaires from the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattons go to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation at the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who scored 4-0 in the first game by a preliminary decision, to the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57th) equalized for guests.
Ireland had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian defense prevented a possible lead goal.
In the 32nd minute, it was a long way off.
After a failed defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to a 1-0 score.

SAP plans to double its workforce in China.
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
It is estimated that by 2015 there will be about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros), Dax said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional R&D facilities and employ relevant personnel,” acting chief executive Bill McDermott said at a customer fair in Beijing.
The current workforce is expected to grow from 2,500 to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world’s leading enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s global more than 176,000 customers are in a country experiencing a boom.
China’s growth plans are also an important cornerstone of Dax’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase its turnover to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, Walldorf earned about 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the software manufacturer’s business, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is doing as well as it has almost never done before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“We would now like to expand our activities (...),” McDermott said.
"Our goal is, with the support of extensive research, to promote sustained growth in China."
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s emotionally powerful new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a list of characters that will make your head spin.
One piece of advice to follow in that moment: Carefully tear out this page and make it a bookmark.
You will get to know all the people very well in Mr. Englund’s novel narrative, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a kind of beacon - at times when you, like the men and women in the story, will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as "anti-historical work".
It contains several well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, but rather a "book about what it was like". It mainly deals with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Grief" combines the war experiences of 20 more-or-less-dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from female students and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers, and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flicker like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the tangle of fates while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classic historical novels.
It reinterprets the notion that World War I was just about the horrific trench battles on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Grief" skillfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve the problems of falling bee nests, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or struggling with the presence of tsetse flies.
Almost from the beginning, it was a very touching read.
War consumes people's lives like some natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When gunfire starts in the distance and you're the woman who's home with your kids, do you run or stay?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is going on, not even why the whole war has been unleashed.
"The vacuum arising from lack of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "was filled with conjectures, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Grief" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from CVs, letters and other published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound scary and engaging, but with the inclusion of small moments and details, they are completely vivid and believable.
Many of them talk about suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Substitutes, substitutes everywhere."
"Coffee substitute, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "meat made from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and supplemented with a false bone made of wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato peels, boots with wooden soles".
He mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the making of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds in himself an interior impulse to savagery and brutality, whereupon he declares of war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable armchairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a good book, pretending that this mask of yours represents civilization and that behind the starched self there is no barbarian hidden inside."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
"When one finally accepts sacrifice, one would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," she writes.
Instead, he feels like a "convicted man who is secretly hanged".
Other remarks concern the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
“Conflict has increasingly become economic competition and competitive struggle,” writes Mr. Englund, “war between factories.”
He captured what he calls "the new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a tailor-made dress who carries out his carnage without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, wickedness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving at the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers bought and used to rub their genitals with in hopes of ending up in hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate have rubbed it in their eyes, which has often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is brisk but not flashy, which fits perfectly with his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, he captures the way the war “has unleashed totally unmanageable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I mostly worked with hints rather than complex narratives, such as "World War I and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels such as "On the Western Front Calm" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional approach.
His book has the most devastating ending that is unprecedented in popular science literature.
I'm not going to tell you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page from your list of heroes and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake, this time for a minute a precisely planned raid
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because by that time the Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the operation except a few high-ranking officers, and others were initially told it was an exercise.
At the head of the action was Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
There were no repeats of cases in recent weeks where, for example, pepper sprays were used against demonstrators, violating the rules of the department and, moreover, a wave of public sympathy poured into the side of the squatters.
Therefore, the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of protesters was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercises.
The leaders were inspired by the operations that took place in other cities.
A massive exercise for the case of behavior in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island section, which was the preparation for the event in Zuccotti Park.
Officials have stepped up so-called riot control training - anti-terror measures involving the rapid transfer of large numbers of police officers - with a focus on the Lower Manhattan area.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" declared by someone to whom the action was initially explained only as "exercises".
"I know a few police officers who were also called into this action, and they certainly weren't told they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke only on condition that he remain anonymous.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew about going to Zuccotti Park."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that the city had already received once.
On October 14, city officials planned to clean up the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as protesters heard about it, hundreds flocked to the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's event was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that a large number of people come and go to the park during the day, so one hour a night was the ideal time to launch the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there would be as few people as possible in the park," he said.
Before the troops set out, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and loudspeakers lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the recorded message roaring from the loudspeakers frightened many protesters.
When riot squad members entered the park wearing their blue windbreakers, many protesters packed up their things and left.
Police say they didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack their bags.
Other teams of police were seen gathering on the edge of the park to break in if any arrests needed to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief spokesman for the police department, Paul J. Browne, claimed that this was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, take the view that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, and in addition, some police officers behaved rudely towards them.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street running along the park's western border could film without difficulty.
Police marched west and weaved through a thick tangle of protestors' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the sanitation department that immediately grabbed everything left in the park.
Some protestors who refused to move were dragged out of the park, and documenting images appeared on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The deadliest group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen in their campground, which lay near the center of the park.
Some set up roadblocks and the police began their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the campground chained themselves to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests at the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly announced.
The operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of "organizing riots and resisting arrests," he clarified.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "did not participate in the management of the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called.
A roadblock was erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these places, the police then developed a protective belt even further away from the Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers were spotted, many of whom were equipped with shields as they pushed people even further beyond that line.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest action of the night took place south of the park.
At around 5 a.m., a protester south of Pine Street was spotted jumping onto the hood of a police car, and several others were emitting air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
Labor union workers will sue the city over dismissal
Unions representing hundreds of school auxiliaries who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday, saying the layoffs were unnecessary and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The lawsuit is arguably the last option left for unions in District Council District 37 in their bid to overturn the dismissal decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators, and other employees who were among the city's worst-paid employees lost their jobs. Their dismissal was described by leading union members as retaliation for the city for not allowing them access to a health care fund managed by work crews last spring, with which the city wanted to seal a hole in the budget.
City officials categorically denied the accusation.
At a meeting of the city council last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the redundancies were part of a budget approved in June.
One of the council members immediately countered that the budget did not specifically talk about the dismissal of auxiliary workers.
District Council 37 officials said they had already filed the necessary documents and warned the Department of Education that they would sue him, calling a press conference on Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuit in Manhattan's Supreme State Court.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiffs will be eight workers laid off, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit and would therefore not comment on the individual charges.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, unions targeted the number of layoffs in poor parts of the city in order to support their claims of unfair conduct, arguing that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have been denied sufficient funding for a long time.
They point out that while Staten Island schools did not lay off at all and the Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs, and District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx, 46 assistants were laid off.
He recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says, "It is not a neighborhood full of moveable parents who can procure funds to make up for the budget deficit."
Public School 36's budget was cut 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money as the city changed the way bonus funds were calculated for each enrolled poor student.
Unions say, among other things, that high school principals may have been confused by the way a document approving the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, that is, to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school payroll to a database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been dismissed," the complaint's draft reads, "and not just moved to the database for the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
Before that, however, the revolution had to succeed, long-time ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Commission will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which she should congratulate Libyans on their successful uprising and thank U.S. troops for "bravery."
"With this statement, we want to acknowledge the courage of the Libyan people who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic aspirations."
The sentences may seem innocent, but no debate about Libya has been easy until now.
Over the summer, lawmakers from both sides argued with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of statements to approve or reject the United States’ military role in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the House due to differences of opinion between the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected measures that would stop funding U.S. operations in Libya.
That put the U.S. mission to Libya literally in a state of legislative purgatory -- Congress criticized President Obama's way of running the mission, but it obviously didn't irritate its members enough to stop encouraging him to do so.
Congressional hesitancy eventually overtook other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
Mission Nato officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the Commission on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and admirable tenacity in trying to liberate their people" and "praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their allies involved in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal get the full support of the Commission on International Relations, or will the legislators again be split in half, as was the case when the June proposal was adopted?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the Republican Party's chief representative on the commission.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday he had not yet seen the final version of the proposal.
The House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget, which should be the top legislative priority for nearly all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, advocated by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on a budget or other subject to be voted on by the whole House or Senate.
Despite considerable efforts, the other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals through to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution that have been introduced in Congress and touched upon a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same motion submitted to both the House and Senate - and others are only minor variations of others.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced-budget amendment in the House alone, and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending."
While some of the proposals are identical, their proponents - especially budding Republicans who want to improve their reputations - can boast of their "authorship."
The budget regulation decree passed in August required both the House and Senate to vote on the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding statement in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss limiting the number of terms in which members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of terms allowed for the presidency.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of amendments that would guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and medical care.
The amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage and the amendment prohibiting the burning of the national flag remains a permanent proposal.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal bills to be annulled if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in drafting various amendments, they do not deviate significantly from the average compared to previous years.
In the 111th Congress they offered 77 amendments, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales compared to the early 1990s, when, according to statistics, the Senate Library members offered more than 150 amendments every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current politicians.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Bashed but not beaten," says Gifford in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was injured in the immediate vicinity by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing along to a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and stating that she was more than interested in returning to Congress for a recovery.
Giffords appeared on ABC News' "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, who was still struggling with sentence-making and needed help walking.
The entire show documented her difficult convalescence, which was necessary because of a bullet wound that pierced her skull in front, penetrated her left half of her brain, and came out of her head in the back.
Surprisingly, she returned to the House three months ago to take a triumphant part in the debt ceiling vote.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 others injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Pretty good."
An interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special episode of the show "20/20", which was aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special has been tracking Gifford's entire convalescence since the January 8 shooting.
In the videos Kelly made during her first week, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, he can’t do more than just lift one or two fingers at a time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and is taught by therapists how to perform simple activities.
Nodding his head.
Lip purging.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos aired by ABC show that music played a pivotal role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman sings along with the melodies therapist to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin".
During an interview with Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, Sawyer revealed that she does not remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said Gifford did not read newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six were who had been killed in the incident.
The suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, is held in a prison in Missouri, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of forced medication.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Horrible, terrible, terrible."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point during her recovery, his wife said, "I lost."
"So I immediately told her, 'Gabby, you didn't lose,'" Kelly described.
"You just got beat up.
But you can do it, get back together, and come back stronger than ever."
Military Forces Meet with Compassion Rather Than Respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration, and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines gathered around it.
The festively dressed crowd stood up and applauded enthusiastically.
"Both men and women serving in the military were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who hosted the spring fundraiser.
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, attended the ceremony, but saw the role of the military units somewhat differently.
"They were all introduced as some sort of orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect, it was regret.
Such completely opposite impressions only illustrate the uneasy relationship between the military and the often aloof, sometimes glorifying American public.
The army is boundlessly showered with praise for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, say the soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if it regrets an individual in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the position of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive for military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil the public relations they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by troops returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the words about regret are uttered in silence and in private among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian were returning from combat operations where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that their service would be viewed from two angles.
From the point of view of some will feel respect and amazement, because they defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
But others will wonder if "an evil, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and returned to Washington to take his seat in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him were quietly hinting at whether he would be able to withstand the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning from a fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to expect negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The army's concern stems in part from America's indifference to war.
Achievements on the battlefield rarely reap recognition in a country that has little knowledge of its own military and little benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as we used to do in World War II,” said Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition from politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, it will be decided whether to launch a trial of 28 women and men against the military over alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, hundreds of other plaintiffs are prepared to file suit.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old on the night she was allegedly raped by her military colleague and was in her 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008, and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she came across her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked if he could join her for a drink in her room.
"A warning light came on in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"She's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, a man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will await the verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be a matter of whether the charges against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, go to trial.
The indictment alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, in violation of the soldiers' constitutional rights.
The charges were filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff party had 17 members at the time. However, over the following months, their number grew to 28-25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military and that the military had failed to investigate, punish, or pursue justice after the announcement of these attacks.
Burke says she's after the highest-ranking military commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The military is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to implement measures against such acts?
Burke also claims to have contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than group all the charges into this case - she put all the eggs in one basket, as she says herself - she will file lawsuits in multiple different cases if necessary so that the pressure does not ease.
The Defense Department's defense team is led by United States Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his associates, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy - basically, current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for injuries sustained as members of the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court order called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active-duty soldiers.
"The alleged injuries relate to the plaintiffs' military service," the document said.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is only a matter of punctuation: in modern wars, it is difficult to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in communication with civilian women present in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers died between these wars - two-thirds of them in combat.
The time has come for modernization in the military, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, and she's got three other attorneys handling the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran's seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly developing an atmosphere conducive to hatred of women.
Independently, the non-profit organization of American Vietnam Veterans is gathering evidence for its anti-military lawsuit, which focuses on the diagnosis of a “personality disorder” allegedly found in rape victims in order to give the military an excuse to release them, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, a human rights activist at the Women’s Action Network.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the state-run Veterans Negotiations Organization, accusing it of discriminating against individuals who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented to Congress by a group of senators and MPs from both political parties, proposing a number of corrective measures.
According to the Department of Defense’s Sexual Violence Prevention and Resolution Office, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, released in March, also discusses the level of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial - half as many as in the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in Deputy Burke's case describe the attacks only as the first in a series of traumas.
Private First Class Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was due to happen.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to different police members, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape, and in her bed was found the blood of the assailant - from the wound she had made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended court hearings during which she was asked questions about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify as witnesses for the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the sentence was handed down," Lyman says.
"I felt I was going to give birth right there on the spot - I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, 'That wasn't his trial. It was mine.'"
The Lymans ordered a visit to a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, calling her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honour and therefore without any right to service.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other plaintiffs moves on to the next phase or not, it’s a long shot, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington Law University.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next stages of the deliberations."
But between them and the verdict stands the aforementioned doctrine, which has been criticized from the first moment it saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is several decades behind schedule because their duties do not provide the same level of incentives and deterrents.
He adds, "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Change will only happen if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not held in their favor, Burkevoa, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, will gather hundreds of other individuals ready to file suit and begin work on other cases related to the subject.
"We will not stop fighting the military on this issue, from where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Are Researching You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July killing rampage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he was certainly not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
“We realized getting them isn’t really that hard at all,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently released report by a British research team on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so vast, Bartlett says, that scientists simply needed to use site advertising to pinpoint the demographics they were looking for, something that marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe, and they drew attention to them and sent them advertisements. However, instead of inviting them into the newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they invited them to fill out a questionnaire asking questions about their level of education, their relationship to violence, and their optimism about their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are irritated by the rising rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more sensible, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.”
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and political researchers use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends, including status updates, wall posts, and “I like” buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. On average, each of them provides three different data per day, which makes this social network literally a "information supernova", which is responsible for the development of many new research. The number of academic works in which the word Facebook appears has increased from five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them on the street.
"It used to be that when you wanted to do a survey of people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to go to a party where they'd never let you," Bartlett says.
"This is all degraded by Facebook - you just go right to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a socio-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who discussed their drunken ascents on Facebook were far more at risk for the problem of alcoholism than students who were silent about the topic.
Moreno suggests that peers monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who posts too many drunken statuses.
“The problem can’t be solved if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior, and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
"We've found a way to identify at-risk children that we wouldn't otherwise have had a chance to discover."
Facebook constantly probes its users’ data.
The site’s information team has produced statistics related to the relationship statuses and Valentine’s Day, voter turnout in 2010 and the nation’s satisfaction rate (mainly using the information they had access to - proponents of internet freedom have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available for others to research).
But Facebook users know that the site is following them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information to the site.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off-line. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users even thought that scientists could look at their profiles," said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using his students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it as if the information was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even when researched offline, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much of your profile information and wall posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That’s why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to use in research.
“When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik Attends His First Public Trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to plotting two attacks in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first public hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar," he told the court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because you have been mandated by organizations that support an ideology of hate and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess my actions, but I admit no guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform from which to voice his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any media contact for 4 weeks, and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept firmly under lock and key.
They all participated in order to move the case to early closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors of the attack told an NRK commentator.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can tell you that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I mentally moved a little further."
Breivik, dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing, with no trouble looking journalists and survivors in the eye on their arrival and departure.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge noted that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
Some may find it comforting that the June 22 attacks appear to be the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically diminish the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she looked like a monster, but she doesn't," said a relative of one of the victims.
“If it were, things would be a lot easier.”
7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people who compared him to Henry Ford - and elected him as his genius The Greatest Modern Inventor.
In a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs, which was dusted off for a special movie this week, Apple fans will be amazed that his creative mind has completely understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a person who fine-tunes every little detail - believing that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their job... [but] there's still a long way to go between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was working on a TV show called "The Triumph of the Computer Fools," which dealt with the dawn of personal computers.
By then, it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company, NeXT, and eagerly watched the general public adopt the Internet.
In the end, only a short portion of the entire Cringely interview was used on the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were rumored to have been lost in transit.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is famous for his reluctance to give longer interviews, Jobs is surprisingly excited to talk about his technology philosophy and business strategies.
He also appears to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the interview, a longer pause occurs between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you can see how Jobs perfectly thinks the answer to be as concise and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’s perfectionism comes to the surface, when he is impatient with Cringely’s questions and drives him to get to more important issues and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the Pixar, iPod, or iPhone era, and features frighteningly prophetic thoughts as Jobs assesses what other companies are doing well and wrong while offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It’s one thing to read through the posthumous ratings of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about Jobs, who we see here as an eager dreamer in the heyday of his genius.
It has its own vision of what things could and should look like.
It wasn’t long before he started putting his ideas into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from The Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"Throughout the years of business, I've always asked, 'Why are you doing this?' and the answer has always been the same: 'Well, that's just how it's done.'"
No one knows why he does what he does, he never thinks deeply about business-related things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way costs were recorded - they often started with the words "standard costs", he could only guess at their amount. At that point, he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the business costs in a moment.
How he ransacked the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
A lot has been written about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm at describing the Blue Box as an instrument of power is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a paid phone and allowed themselves to be switched from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
“We’ve been around the world at least half a dozen times, so when we yelled something into a pay phone, it was called a minute later from the second phone at the door,” Jobs laughs.
“We were young, and we found that we could build a thing that could manage billions of dollars of infrastructure all over the world.”
The two of us made a tiny little thing that was able to control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I don't think Apple would have been created without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a prank he and Wozniak nearly pulled to completion. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican asking if they could talk to the Pope, impersonating Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Gradually, increasingly senior members of the Catholic Church were called in to talk to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and it was only just before the Pope himself was awakened that the pair fluttered and put the earpiece down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and was looking for spare parts to build a oscillator, he found Bill Hewlett's phone number in the phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It influenced me incredibly. It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company really is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with it immediately.
As a teenager at HP, I progressed higher and higher, I hung around that computer and started writing programs for it.
How to invent innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about how he invents new products on the fly.
Early in his career, when he set out to sell a few printed circuit boards, one customer asked him to assemble an entire computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember we were fighting pretty fiercely... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to assemble a mouse that would cost $300] until I got tired of it, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How Big Companies Are Breathing:
Long before he led Apple’s resurrection, Jobs foresightedly predicted that many industry leaders would falter in their vision and lose their market share.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what’s next?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are in control, so companies are led by people who are in charge of this, while people who are in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius who has led the company to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
This is exactly what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it was, it could have been Microsoft in the nineties...
Instead of winning, they lost.
How he views innovation as an art form:
“There’s still a long way to go between a great idea and a great product...and as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows.”
During that time, you will learn a lot about it.
You have to make a number of compromises - certain things you just can't make electrons, glass, robots or factories do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, taste matters - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in some way you try to project them into what you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed to steal the best ideas.
The Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked at it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and coincidentally also the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would be able to do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the Health Care Act while their case was being handled by the court.
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether to accept an objection to President Obama's health care bill, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm that will attend the hearing in front of the court.
The incident occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the motions tabled.
One of the cases under consideration was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging a radical overhaul of health care passed last year by Congress - a bill that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges have agreed to hear the case, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, with the result further galvanizing presidential elections scheduled for 2012 and in full swing at the time of the ruling.
The lawyer who will stand up in court and try to get the bill rejected will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society group, which has been engaged in advocacy for conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations challenging the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
It was attended by, among others, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of Republicans in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: This pair of judges has been participating in the Federalist Society for years.
There is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from complying with the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
If it were not, however, their conduct would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which states that "a judge may participate in events that are currently being held by related and other organizations for the purpose of obtaining funding, but a judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor be featured on the agenda of the event."
Still, Scalia and Thomas’ relationship to the two law firms involved in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial stake in the case, was enough to alert activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct contradicts the assertion by several judges that the Supreme Court is behaving according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges drank and dined at a community fundraiser along with attorneys waiting to hear their case in court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines the feet of all claims of disinterestedness, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy for their critics, telling them that they also seamlessly combined their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife Ginni is a high-profile conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives argue that the ethical problem lies mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as Attorney General under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
Kagan's critics are pressuring her to relinquish her involvement in the case, claiming that she fought for the law so much back then that she could now be disinterested.
Kagan had no indication that she was about to resign.
Boeing wins record $18 billion jet contract
Emirates Airlines is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle jets with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air for more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 of its products, it’s usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is a Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer and the cost of these 50 aircraft totals a record $18 billion, it is something else.
Equally important is where Boeing got the order from: the Middle East, a sprawling gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest dollar-worth order in history for 50 twin-aisle jet Boeing 777s this weekend.
This is a great deal for Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline has the option to buy 20 more aircraft, bringing the total value of the order to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes called Dreamliners, with significantly improved fuel economy and passenger facilities.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
“This is excellent news for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many of the airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-producing nations.
This means that not only do they have money to pay for planes, but the rise in the price of fuel - mostly damaging to the airline because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country itself makes money from higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or delay aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, Dihora said.
“It’s a natural protection,” he said.
The order from Emirates reinforces Boeaing’s leading position in the wide-body aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS to the fore in an attempt to undermine Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after representatives from Airbus announced the postponement of the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor to the 777-300ER.
The displacement occurred because customers demanded more payload and range, so the manufacturer took the time to deliver more engine power to the machine.
The price of Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's president's sister appears defeated in Michigan election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto Vallejon of the PRI, was helped in the pursuit of the governor's seat by drug traffickers.
Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost the violent state election for governor in Michoacán, subsequently claiming on Monday that one of her opponents had been helped to win by drug traffickers.
The preliminary results attributed the leadership in the Western state's gubernatorial election to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of members of organized crime in the whole electoral process, and especially in yesterday's election itself, is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country," Calderon said in a radio interview the day after the election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the opinion polling group... they confiscated ballot boxes, built roadblocks... and had people vote on PRI's behalf.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its presidency.
However, he plans to return to power soon, and winning the election in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have beaten Calderon, who was leading the day before the election, only very narrowly.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now has dominated the governorship, was third. For a divided and unlucky persecuted party, it is a very unfortunate loss ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderon and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against the traffickers.
But the violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAN party, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election and many candidates resigned out of fear.
However, whatever the outcome of the Michoacán elections looks like for the PRI party, winning the party will help to gain new momentum.
The PRI's expected representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington congratulated Vallejo, saying "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
ADB urges Asia to help save eurozone
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise the global economy could suffer a global downturn, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, chief executive of Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest-growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help the currency bloc recover rapidly through the International Monetary Fund, or through direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the countries of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are watching all European troubles “too unexcitingly” and said that Asian financial aid, combined with European leadership and funds, would help ward off the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
“So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is a good fit,” he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it’s certainly not immune.”
“So if China and India can help, they definitely should.”
The European Monetary Association has been suffering from a severe debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe raised fears that it could bring the global economy back into recession, and calls began to emerge to bring the newly booming leading economies together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of bonds by the European Union's Financial Assistance Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility - would provide greater bargaining opportunities for Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do its best" to help the eurozone, as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we must maintain a high rate of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India, have nothing to do to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe's 1.2 billion inhabitants of India, with 800 million of them living on $2 or less a day.
“One day they might find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and enjoying their holidays on the beaches, which would probably be difficult to explain,” he said.
Lee Howell, director general of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian supplies should be used to keep well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis was threatening a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank’s forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011 and 2012 now faces a “risk of decline” due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets must develop “plans of unforeseeable spending” to protect them from falling and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon Warning of Possible Defense Cuts
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta put a lot of pressure on Congress on Monday when he warned that looming automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefields of Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next decade, but it is now worried about a further $600 billion cut if Congress fails to reach a spending deal.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress' failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called attachment will cause a 23% flat-rate decline and halt many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this indiscriminate way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipbuilding projects - you can't just buy three-quarters of a building or a ship. Moreover, it could seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave in order to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes may shake the faith of those who care about our military and seriously damage its preparedness."
In the end, the cuts will also affect combat units, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected by this stoppage, the operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contract staff, which will result in a delay in the contracted contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"The payroll of employees will be reduced, which will result in late payments to suppliers and the consequent disruption of legal and political support."
The two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago asking him for details about the possible impact on automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a stoppage in the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign up for it."
"Planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It remains to be seen whether Panetta's letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress approving the budget and amplify calls to remove the Pentagon from the list of cut-off areas.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken in recent talks about possible cuts, even as he transitioned to his senior position at the Pentagon with years of Congressional and White House budget approval experience, so he knew he was getting into a tough fight.
At a press conference held last week, the defence minister gave a brief picture of what his department might expect - the shell of the military, but inside it will be missing a core.
"He'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like a brigade without ammo."
"It will be like an air force without trained pilots."
"He'll be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the start of a speech at the Pentagon.
"She will be like a moraleless unit, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In an attachment delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts, and disasters; significant reduction in dropout and deployment options worldwide; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could be expected to end, including those already being tested and those still in the early stages of planning.
The list included the F35 project, a planned new bomber, a next-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal battleship, and a new ground combat vehicle to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but its proponents say this is a necessary next step in improving the military needed to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A glance at recent newspaper headlines shows just how serious and pervasive lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full accusing him of sexually harassing several women, both sides claiming the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were charged with perjury when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barack Obama with a microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy entire careers and cloud the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately refuted by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of abusing his campaign funds to try to conceal his extramarital affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus surrounding Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
There are stories of cheating at school and university.
There are cases where teachers give their students test answers just to make themselves look good in their assessments.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send the message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many scams do we encounter?
Studies show that you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 times in a single day.
Let us suppose that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first encounter.
Identifying lies, or “recognition of lies,” is a necessary skill that should be learned by everyone, whether for personal or professional reasons.
However, it is not a social game that is similar to, say, Charade, where one shouts, "I have you." Deception is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're stuttering, stuttering, blushing, or stitching.
However, do not assume that it is difficult to spot and detect liars.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from a sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I’ve spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a large and growing sector of lie-recognition, and it’s clear that exposing deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and can help you a lot in today’s complex world, especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating, or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them relax their guard, direct their emotions, and intuitively recognize how the other party accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect one's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (but the lies they tell are usually "outrageous").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called "initial observation."
It will give you something to compare it to later.
Note the posture of the subject, his laughter, work with the voice.
You should know if someone is patting their feet all the time, so you don’t wrongfully accuse them of lying just because they start patting their foot in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
Think of it as a warning sign, not a lie.
Lying people may stop moving the top half of their body as they try to remember their made-up story, turn their toes to the door, lean toward the exit, significantly change posture, or show "relief after the conversation" - over-relaxing relaxation and changing position when confession is difficult behind them.
Interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what the relief will look like when it is over.
See the subject’s language.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once misspoke and used the past tense when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, triggering a nationwide search for her body.
Lying individuals may also express themselves aloofly: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal signs are very slight.
Someone can use a lot of "melting language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
In such an answer, we do not learn too many facts, and often this is another warning sign.
There is no magic that can detect every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills to detect it.
Using these skills, you will have a better chance of not falling for a liar and a fraud in your personal and professional life.
Controversial plan to build oil pipeline will be rerouted after threat of delaying US government approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - pitting trade unions against each other but placating environmentalists - the pipeline construction company announced it was willing to redirect the project to get things moving again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it will move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska government headquarters.
TransCanada’s Alex Pourbax says the company believes the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will run a different route.
The announcement came after the State Department said last week it was delaying a decision to federally authorize the project, from where it would not conduct studies of possible alternate routes through which it could not intervene in the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a sprawling underground water reservoir.
"This is really a move forward," Republican Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment ordered by the Foreign Ministry would probably postpone any decision until 2013, one year after next year’s election, but the authorities deny that politics played a role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a State Department request and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas, it flows 700,000 barrels of oil every day.
Six states will have to cross this path.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but loved by work crews, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created while working on the pipeline.
However, Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing environmental impact study commissioned by the State Department found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but a source from the energy industry said the Department Inspector General ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
One was whether a TransCanada-hired lobbyist, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's advisor in 2008, represented a conflict of interest in the program.
Another was whether the company that was hired to perform the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of making a toddler throw up.
The New York family says singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan home and scared their daughter into throwing up.
"Lady Marmalade's performance scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in a lawsuit filed with Manhattan's Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk pulled up the car, Roseanna Monk came down to the lobby of their house on Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and I left to pick her up"
LaBelle irritably reprimanded the pregnant woman.
"She said to me in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care about your opinion.'"
She got angry and began to speak dirty - she screamed out the meanest expressions...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she started splashing water all over me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
"I said to the woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the mother said.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who was still in Genevieve's arms - and had to be stopped by her escort, who then dragged her to the waiting car, Roseanna Monk testified.
The little girl screamed so much that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and spokesperson have not responded to our calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all of the money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially when it's directed at a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child."
Disadvantages of the climate have hampered the economy.
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's rule, unemployment and unreliability rose in Sinaloa, foreign investment declined, and with it the economy
The year 2011 will go down in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the reign of Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the government of change. This government has brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to the adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been recorded and even the main indicators of economic development have declined.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the possibilities of growth of the state economy, and caused a 3.6% decrease in economic activity in the first semester of this year. In the field of agriculture, there was a historical decrease of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% was found to be partially damaged. The main crops destroyed include vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity until November was caused by a constant increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state saw an increase during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% against the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment rose to about 5,28%, and between July and August, the average unemployment rate rose further, reaching 6.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is related to various factors. These include, among other things, loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints due to legislation passed by Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally seize dollars to earn them, invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Stop the migration
López Cervantes said that demographic factors also contributed to the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people who go abroad to work in the United States has decreased, both because of the difficulty of entering and because even if these people cross the border, it is difficult for them to get a job. So people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is rising," he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the increasing unreliability that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of employed people in the state work without paying benefits to the Social Security Administration.
To unemployment and unreliability are added other features of the labor market, such as low salaries. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries from the whole country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesetas by September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Shortening of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, there was also the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,697 between January and June, a decrease of 87.74% compared to $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the government of the state reports investments of 17 280 million pesetas per year. These investments were mainly directed to service businesses.
Debt
In connection with the economic downturn scenario, the government of this state asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso. This would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million peso. Until November, no debt gains were recorded, in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés pointed out the lack of management skills of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of Transformational Industries, said there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the state government itself, in 2011.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been really minuscule during this year. We have to work hard to regain the land we lost this year. In 2012, we have to redouble the effort, there was no harmonization of the efforts of all of us and especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo López said events such as the frost at the beginning of the year had halted the state's economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore dynamism, which would allow to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year, we found ourselves far below the expected forecasts," he said.
Redefining the Mission
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employer’s Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed into more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we observe that work is being done. We believe that it is necessary to prepare a long-term plan in which the goals and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important that all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has is mobilized," he said.
The work ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting out a vision for the future that would better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there have been some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration has shown progress in terms of public policy leadership.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I think the government is aware that there is a lot of work ahead of us too," he said.
Sentenced to 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic reported that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a crime of endangering health, namely possession of marijuana for business purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by Mexican Army forces on 7 June 2010 while on an errand in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80 in El Castillo district, Navolato.
The dealer was driving in a white pick-up van. He had a black bag in the car shelf and a small backpack in the passenger seat. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detained man remained at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Ward and the proceedings remain internal within the Center for the Implementation of the Legal Impacts of Crimes.
He owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Habitat, Saving Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, face the risk of not being completed or they will be very late due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The director of urban social development said that if the construction work has gone forward so far, there is now a risk that the state government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million pesos on three programs.
He stated that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. By this time, only the Federation and the city have supplied funds for the work, so it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of projects.
"They are supposed to secure almost 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we have not received anything at all. Even though we should have received part of it already in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we have started projects and they are going very well, but we lack the money".
He stated that last year under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not meet the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to be able to pay more than 7 million, which was not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us already in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the mentioned programs this year, we had to get funds to cover what the state did not finish," he explained.
Despite there being a promise made by state officials to hand over these resources, he said a request had been sent to Armand Villarreal, Secretary of Administration and Finance, to hasten the proceedings and the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even gotten a peso yet."
Court Approves 'End of Analogous Broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected a constitutional lawsuit filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which wants to hasten the so-called "switching off analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He stated that the necessary eight votes were not found to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Mezo, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree detailing the steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed, because a qualified majority of eight votes needed to allow the court to comment on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the aforementioned decree, which thus remains valid, was not reached.
The draft judgment prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues related to radio and television is a matter that is reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). This violates the principles of hierarchical subordination and the exception to the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described therein, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion about the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he does not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through the general norms of measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," he said, noting that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive branch, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in recent years, linked to better use of the radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality, and more channels.
He believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefits of digitalisation, which requires public interest decisions, because digitalisation not only has a technical dimension, but also "affects economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he pointed out, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the hands of the government of the state".
A number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to a digital system and have done so through their governments, despite having highly specialised technical bodies at their disposal.
He said it was not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree, which to some extent interferes with the powers of Congress, to introduce into the administration compliance with laws prepared by the legislative power.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of adding "voice after voice"
According to data published by PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, 879 votes from 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "vote after vote" appeared in this year's election in Michoacán, where, according to data published by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and it has not yet counted 879 votes out of a total of 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral authority approved a number of measures that should harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not officially confirm his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the statutory deadline for their entry into force was due to expire in this parliamentary term, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel neglected to publish them within the prescribed deadline in the Act of the Official State Gazette, stating that he had some objections to them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) settled a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative power and declared the head of state's voice on constitutional reforms to be "invalid and illegal" because he has no right to "neither approve nor veto" them.
When asked about the possibility of counting "voice after vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM, it would be possible for a local electoral authority to carry out a partial and total census.
In this way, partial counting of votes, one or more election packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not match; there is no record of the vote count and the calculation in the appropriate box or the given chairman does not have it available; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, a total recount of votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there is evidence to suggest that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request from the party and/or coalition representative who proposed the candidate in second place appears at the beginning of the session.
A total recount will also be possible if, after a proper tally, the difference between the likely winner and the runner-up candidate is found to be equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request from the political party whose candidate finished runner-up. In such a case, the electoral parcels for which a partial tally has been made will be discarded.
It should be noted that in this situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapaliname Mountains, the family has confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. A ceremony and a memorial service will take place on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors along with the other persons killed in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force plane. Family and close friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garza Avenue, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell party was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school tech classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation preparations.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and his wish was that his ashes would be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range. That's what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the height of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire flight school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he even drove a truck, however he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as they did when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopany for his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died while doing what he liked most in life: driving an airplane.
They gave him a last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lt. Col. of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican Army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of Saltillo Technological High School, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled in both study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died in recent days after the helicopter he was driving crashed. Also on board was the Cabinet Secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other persons, all officials of this state.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Saltillen native Bacio Cortés (burned) arrived to be handed over through funeral service to the Mexican Air Force under Major Jaime Martinez in the area where, meanwhile, the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers had gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies found at Cadereyta NL estate
A few hours before the find, military officials introduced to the media 11 people who had been detained in the area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by gunfire in various parts of the body and head were found on an abandoned farmhouse in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The finding occurred on a 1.5 kilometre road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with a beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One of the people was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark cotton trousers and was not wearing shoes. Next to him was also a man in a sports T-shirt with white stripes.
A few meters away was the body of another person dressed in a red sports T-shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three lay face down towards the ground.
According to data obtained at the sites, all three persons were probably murdered at another location because no bullets were found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed to one group of organized crime the other, and also a number of bullet marks, both on the buildings and on the doors.
11 suspects arrested in Cadereyta
The National Defense Secretary introduced 11 individuals, including juveniles, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and that is associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burials.
According to the information released in the first attempt on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and managed to free one person detained.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, confirming that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another raid occurred on 12 November at 6 a.m. Military personnel were on patrol in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when they noticed a car without a license plate and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they conducted a search and discovered one rifle, a shell casing and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was arrested on 13 November at about 2 p.m. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present him with a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country above the precipice of economic disaster.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present him with a new government that will face a crisis that is holding the country above the precipice of economic disaster and has put the entire eurozone at risk.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he could form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were being overcome.
"The framework is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is struggling to combat a political and financial crisis that has brought debt levels to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the tough austerity package demanded by Europe's leaders, only to restore Italy's hacked credibility.
There is a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry, because of market instability, interest rates on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity have exceeded the 7% threshold, a level where Greece and Ireland had to ask for a bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of Confindustria, an Italian employers' organization, told reporters after the meeting with Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government".
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this burning situation.
Monti's hopes for success have been greatly boosted by the PDL's support for Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because up to now, a number of its members have opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti has put together.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure, warning that Monti's failure could spell disaster.
Monti opened talks with political parties, unions and business groups, youth and women's organizations on Monday.
The round will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, which allowed for a very rapid procedure in response to the crisis.
After a brief decline at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, interest on Italian bonds returned to a critical level, responding to uncertainty about whether the new prime minister would reap success.
Saving Italy, whose public debt stands at 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the scope of the eurozone’s current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should stay in power until the next elections, which are scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians will only give him time to carry out reforms and then call early elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that the government must be made up of only experts to take Italy out of the troubles that the country has come into because of financial pressure.
Political sources have said that mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures in the government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, 10 will cross the 50-match line.
On Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 called-up players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the side of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 players of both countries who met today for a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, FIFA's number one monthly rating, have a wide range of A-class inter-selection matches to their credit, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who is the only one to have played 50 international matches.
He reached this figure last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish football players, who play in the Stars and in the powerful clubs of the English First League, have maintained intense activity in league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches within European cups such as the Champions League for over a year.
We must also add to the previous experience of the national Spanish team in complicated elimination matches for the European and world championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited possibilities of foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We can see that the biggest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team is scored by goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (losing 0-1 in London) reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will continue to play against Costa Rica and set a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, a key Barcelona player, has played 106 games.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players who have a hundred games to their credit. Among them the already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle striker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol came close with 97 games.
They are followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and close to Michael Uman move left winger Júnior Díaz with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Only 5 have broken the 30 match mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least number of matches.
With fewer than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches, they cost Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25, and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one, and Ilman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour to celebrate 20 years of existence
"A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of the best shows at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that for them the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
That’s what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil, said.
The group is on tour in South America to celebrate 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20th.
On this day, they will perform from 7:30 pm at the National Stadium along with the angel group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the website of La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, this is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
Traveling to Costa Rica is also a dream come true.
In South and Central America we are barely the second time and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation. It's a beautiful country and I believe we will be able to stay here for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally love the band here, the fans are going through these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your worst supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long.
Some people refer to the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have been over a few weeks.
We did some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we got into shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we like the jungles. For both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. So we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What are your plans for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limits on what we can't do.
We will try to show the best show with a variety of songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven’t played in a long time, we focus on them and we are surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
That makes the show more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people, too.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of the artistic career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined being in one big rock band and staying in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given and we are moved that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We’re lucky to be able to see the places we’ve always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were a significant part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of greats.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends, it doesn’t happen very often.
From time to time, a group is formed in a city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to arise from one city at a time.
We are proud to be part of this group from Seattle.
Sometimes we play with others.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a lot longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think that, firstly, we are all lucky to be still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are always interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have been able to open musical paths that allow everyone enough freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we value each other’s music, and I don’t think it could be any better.
Your relationship to the word fame has not been easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew, it became easier to find balance.
We try not to tour too much because it’s very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people come here for music, you remind yourself that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You mustn't get carried away by being famous, rock stars. This has never really interested either of us.
What do you think of Mother Love Bone?
I think we were writing great songs and it was something spectacular in the beginning.
As a band, we existed for three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that we are still friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in a band with us. When I listen to a song or look at photos, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh with him, talk about music or football.
She was an incredible person and we miss her very much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as the opening act?
Yes, the production sent us videos with a few suggestions and we liked this group the most, so we are curious what Las Robertas will offer live and they must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influences you as a bassist?
Lots of people.
Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I could talk all night about bassists that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge, even though it is no longer in fashion?
I think we've always felt slightly separated from the word grunge.
When I think of grunge, I think of the bands I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the other bands that came out at the same time, and if that’s how music is today, it’s something great because it’s music that’s worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly gloomy character and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
That’s interesting because I feel like there’s a couple of songs in the new album that are lighter in scale, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very bleak, although they may sound positive.
For both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and they're songs that are deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent just that to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make grim music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalised again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital where he will be tested for muscle loss in his lower extremities, his attending physician said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is currently under medical control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, an MP who is his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will be undergoing tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases within three days to find out why he is in pain and why he is losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, however, the former president himself does not want the pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer, dropping 18 kilograms, and to these problems were added other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been serving a sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a murderous troop squadron operating illegally in the first years of his rule.
Mujica visits Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to achieve an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of an extensive visit full of meetings with representatives of politics, business and the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office posted on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to back Uruguay in a dispute with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to be tax havens would be excluded from the international community, a statement that prompted a backlash from Uruguay and consultation with the ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries. Since January this year, the Latin American country has concluded an information exchange agreement to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to specify fiscal exchange agreements in order to get off the "blacklist" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which there are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
Mexico and Uruguay have signed a free trade agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of villain Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all stores around the world this month, was created from the beginning to take advantage of all the features offered by the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, a press officer specializing in Nintendo in Spain, during a presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game created specifically for this carrier" because up to now successful images like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of time 3D" have been adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that in addition to being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can start the "second round" on the levels of the game, which this time are more challenging.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This new arrival of Super Mario in 3D also envisages the return of the character to a portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays into the music of those who watch the saga and repeats the successful formula from previous episodes. It consists in the fact that the plumber of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous mined platforms in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in moves, surroundings, disguises and also among the enemies, there will also be a "playful" Luigi.
Colom approves extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom said on Tuesday he had stepped up efforts to extradite former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for conspiring to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the process to get Guatemala to respond to a request from a northern country demanding the extradition of Portillo in order to judge him.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision is in line with the independence of the judicial and executive powers and that he is mindful that the criminal court has already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his mandate, he did not "interfere" with court decisions and allowed all extraditions that came to his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move marks a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to prosecute a former president who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of misappropriation of $120 million in the Ministry of Defense at the time of his presidency. This process preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed, putting the case back in the game.
Trinidad helped 6,000 youths in a state of emergency
The organization was created to help children without education, so that they would not find themselves on the fringes of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the organisation's existence is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped. The organisation has been helping them to overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this must be added the long hundreds of jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present the balance sheet as part of the ceremony, which took place in the former production premises of both the Fabra and Coats factories and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, no work, struggling with drug addiction or in a situation where they might fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday’s meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with President Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist Education Advisor, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Councillor Ricard Goma.
Both Fabra and Coats were joined by the current Social Welfare and Family Adviser, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove originated in a very difficult time and that today's time also offers a number of obstacles, but added that the work the association has brought to this day "is a good foundation".
The president cited Trinidad as an example of how it is possible to combat adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“The crisis is nothing new to this organization and the work it does,” he said.
There was an eviction of the occupied house, in which gigantic parties were held
Intruders appropriated 11 out of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors at 51 Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, where they were illegally occupying and where they were organizing gigantic parties that woke up the neighbors. They left the building by order of the court and without the need for police to intervene.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," said the administrator.
The occupiers, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all electrical and partly water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving behind garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments huge parties were held, which lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that during the time the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupiers of the building made her unfair competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the disco costs 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to complaints from neighbors about noise, but the problems were caused not by visitors to the disco, but by the residents of the occupied house, and especially by those who attended the parties, the frequency and intensity of which has increased in recent weeks, according to the angry residents of the neighborhood.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have been forgiving her rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
Last week, Alberto Fernández Díaz, chairman of the PP municipal group in the town hall, demanded that "the building be immediately evicted to put an end to the problems of civil coexistence suffered by neighbors and to the destruction of the area".
The chairman of the People's Party explained that only one floor had been taken before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers had reached all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in one of them there were even thefts.
He added that "there is a need to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against civil liability that have occurred in the building."
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police reached building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people enter the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of the announcement of the proceedings, which brings more than controversy about fees
The 16-gate city competition once again opens the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this municipality printed several pamphlets in support of the Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What’s more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York’s Central Park.
After the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that are oriented not on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a nature park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of Yogi Bear.
Such was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entry gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, records the idea of the park.
It's either that or someone's trying to place a gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational and based on reflection on the city, this issue becomes a central theme for all Barcelona architects.
It’s a subject as familiar as when two members of this old caste of chosen ones shake hands in the elevator.
And it was this act that produced one of the rare matches between what three Barcelona architects and pre-university professors thought.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection process is well founded.
According to Roldán, after the question of the side of the bay was raised, "there is also a need" to discuss the "mountain side", so Ildefonso Cerdo's speech about green apples was not followed to the end.
“We have to start from the principle that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, its high availability.
Collserola is more complex", said the architect, for whom the name "Gateway to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as demarcation of zones where it is possible to operate".
Modol, as well as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The danger resulting from the "uncertainty represented today by the public place project" after the experience of the 1980s, which had "its swansong" in the forum area.
The first concern is the very demarcation of the boundaries where it should be built.
"Defining something means taking the next step", that is, basically taking it a step further.
"New urban planning tools need to be kept in mind, because the current ones (referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster".
If we focus on the question in more detail, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserol can be "considered a park", but the Barcelona part is not, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola, which "must not end up in the dump", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall is offering his Bureau to intervene in the project from "the first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a sort of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but he "does not doubt" that it should be precisely this technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds) that need to be created: "Architects should only be tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name to this game is complex, as Collserol's global vision for the selection process is lacking: "16 tenders have been announced that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that looks at the area and understands it as a whole".
This causes him, at least, to apply to all 16 selection procedures.
Otherwise, the design of a single gate may hint at the concept and definition of the architect of a neighboring gate.
In his view, the City Hall should guarantee that the zone immediately above Ronda de Dalt should provide a full-length zone of equipment to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino Pardons Jonas Larrazábal, Who Will Be Released
After 72 days in prison, Cadino Red granted a pardon to Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after being pardoned by Casino Red's legal representative before the District's Second Criminal Court, which was hearing a case of extortion in which Monterrey's brother was indicted.
After the Casino Royale assassination, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García posted a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás was asked to pay an economic quota to allow the Monterrey City Hall to operate illegally in the betting house.
After the public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal prosecution against the brother of the Panist mayor.
Then, after spending 4 hours in front of Public Ministry Agent Number 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days after the second incarceration order was passed and a Public Ministry agent disproved the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Criminal Court on suspicion of extortion of the owners of Casino Red by the sum of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in a medium-duty prison as he was threatened with death.
Leaders allowed him to stay in the city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the Second Criminal Court's secretary, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after nearly two months of investigation, enough evidence had been collected to prove Jonas' guilt. Evidence includes, for example, the payment of a sum of 1.5 million pesos to casino representatives in exchange for a promise that the operation would be allowed.
This Monday, Casino Red’s legal representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the region’s mayor’s brother, and on that basis, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal hearing, a Public Ministry representative assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damages had been repaired and who among the associates decided to grant a pardon, but the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, a legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal. No complaint will be made in the process conducted against him. It is also not possible to claim damages or punishment.
After a trial with a legal representative at around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Breton.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanez, arrived at the prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been granted an official pardon and his case had been postponed to the archives.
He was also informed that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Dionisio Pérez Jacome, the secretary of state, presented details of the plane crash that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven other people.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) said the results of an investigation into the crash that killed Cabinet Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven others showed the helicopter hit the ground with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
Speaking at a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jacome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the flight, the pilot stated that climatic conditions allow the flight.
"Parts appearing indicate the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, wings tangled in tree branches 25 meters from where the unit lost its hull".
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met all the requirements for transporting personnel.
In addition, he said that based on an investigation conducted in the area of impact, no components were found on the ground.
"In the search, it was found that the parts of the plane were not located in another place, so the plane hit the land as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that the most important thing at the moment is to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, stated that at the time of the impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that this was a normal overflight operation at the time of the accident," he said.
At the press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jacome listed six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at launch, accordingly, the aircraft is advancing towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico were noticeable layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouds the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility as far as the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the helicopter from the radar coincide, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the trajectory of the flight before the impact.
Dispersion of aircraft remnants within a restricted area:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
A sketch of the aircraft's debris scattering indicates that at the time of impact on land, the helicopter was intact.
There was no fire or explosion.
No evidence was recorded at the scene of the disaster that there had been an explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During fieldwork, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, the height of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show footage that likely disintegrated along the route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, in a territory larger than the area of demarcation, the remains of the helicopter were not found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in a state where the helicopter was still intact.
Mexican Institute of Health Insurance Launches Research into Gene That Causes Obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to detect a gene causing obesity in children and young people. Research called "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" will allow to get results related to overweight.
In a report, the head of the Medical Biochemistry Research Unit at the National Medical Center’s 21st Century Specialized Hospital, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been established.
This team relies on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, with or without authorization, can also participate in the research. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centers in Valle de México, where they will be tested for juveniles from 8 a.m.
He pointed out that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexican State) and since 8 October, this activity has also been carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (East of Mexico State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children has been obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and eventually at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the goal of this research is to determine the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to track down risk factors in Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
To mark International Diabetes Day on November 14, he said the goal is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with parental consent and supervision, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday, all participants are made anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels are determined, and genes are examined (trying to identify genes that are involved in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said the research reflects health officials' concerns about the alarming increase in baby weight.
'Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was a 77% increase in obesity among boys and 47% among girls. There was a dramatic increase also in overweight,' said an IMSS expert.
He stated that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Native American genetic makeup, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) that is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the participants’ direct benefit was that they received an overall assessment of the children’s condition to see if they showed any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetes conditions.
For now, the information is confidential, with doctors writing to parents explaining all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make to help their children avoid illness.
Cruz López explained that there are three main ingredients that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that implies a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV all day, and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
Overweight is also caused by a large caloric intake, i.e. a greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins, and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
In Asphalt from UNAM there will be no potholes
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalts with polymers, creating a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature.
Nearly 200,000 potholes would not need to be repaired after each rainy season in the Valle de México metropolitan area if the pavements were properly cared for, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavements were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in potholes, or even a complete elimination of them.
In his lecture, Technological Cause of Potholes, which he delivered as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, which should create a mixture with similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and at high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve functionality and reduce pothole formation.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is an assembly of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules of high molecular weight called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight called maltenes. Together, they give asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic character of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity, and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but varies during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperature, a chemical engineering expert has warned.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Mexico City are covered with flexible paving, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the uppermost layers is an asphalt insert, made up of small pebbles embedded in the asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that makes up the liner is covered with asphalt.
When passing cars or creating pressure, it is possible to distribute the forces in the pavement well.
If it was modified asphalt, it would decompose even better, according to a chemical engineer.
He added that the last layer, called the shell, is placed on the asphalt insert, consisting of fine stone, i.e. sand also embedded in the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have a greater mechanical force than the asphalt insert and must provide friction to the roadway.
Since it will be exposed to heavy loads as part of the paving, the shell must be of sufficient thickness and care must be taken of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great effect on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is moist, the water spreads inwards and it is hard to get out, this causes all the paving layers to soften and thus create potholes.
He explained that when potholes are created, the film of the shell is damaged first and only then the asphalt liner is damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one time, but it is a gradual process that should be stopped at the first signs with the help of appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load on vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of pavement must correspond to the load on vehicles and ensure that this load is not exceeded. This is the only way to prevent frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there is still a lot of work to be done when it comes to asphalt, and research is at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries, make it easy to repair potholes without having to use high temperatures, are worth mentioning.
What was the missing candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analyses of factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna not winning the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first multiplemiss.
Valle del Cauca did not reach Miss Colombia's crown again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with finding herself on the podium of the winners, gaining a silver crown and a sash, on the basis of which she became the new first multiplemiss of Colombia.
On the basis of the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which she won and the sceptre was taken by Miss Atlántico (1989), the aforementioned department won the 14th title of the first moremiss. Melina thus joined the ranks of women from Valle del Cauca, which came within reach of the winning crown, but were eventually announced by the first moremiss.
A question that many are asking themselves. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the big favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has the ability to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing became the Queen of the Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were won by Italian Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently also took the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only First Multimiss is the fact that it did not convince its answer to the question, "Which book did you like the most and why?", which was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of Leamos literary editors.
When asked, the candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I believe it is one of the forms of culturalization. The book that influenced me the most in my childhood was "The Little Prince", a very deep book.
I'm currently reading Crime and Punishment. It's a book that's part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. It's a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer was displeased both by the term “culturalize” and by the fact that the candidate did not explain how the various books affected her.
At the end of the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and pleased with the result: "The world is wise, what is supposed to happen will happen.
And you people, read it if you can. The Little Prince is a wonderful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of favorite.
A Bogotá journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who had won all the previous awards (the Gastronomic Challenge of Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen’s Mother) aroused the envy of other applicants, stressing the Queen, who then fell into disrepair on the scene.
This was evident during the first presentation of the swimsuit at Hilton Beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Although she shone on both, it was clear that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm shown by representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the "Like at Home" program on Canal RCN, believes that Melinda's winning the first multimiss title confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not ultimately leave with the Queen's crown.
In addition, Valle has had a rather unfriendly attitude towards the media in recent days, and this has not paid off for him.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Contest.
Just to the sidelines, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said she was looking for a woman who would be aware of her country's social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia pageant, beauty alone is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social sensibilities. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was noticeable on the buttocks. But this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which elected her a miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the queens, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the problems with the fibrosis in the buttocks, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took away her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the Valle native made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they didn't work in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and here she took her toll."
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Assembly, a cruel prediction came true after the swimsuit show. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction Raymundo gave Melina, so that he did not have to award her the highest crown in the end.
True or not, it is certain that today Melina began the year of her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, to which she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite overwhelming success in Cartagena, did not make it to the crown.
This was the work of a Cali resident who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A fingerprint expert from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4 last year, a fingerprint expert from the CTI in Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of Farc: "Alfonse Cana", through a fingerprint comparison.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department, it was Eliazar González, a Puerta Tejada man who has been working in forensic research for 21 years, this week.
Early in his career, González worked at Chocó Town Hall, where he often had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to a place where there were corpses that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital, Valle, and after completing the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of rubbing the skin, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against the aforementioned Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he set off for Cauco in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the world's oldest guerilla, so they asked him to take a fingerprint card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the location of the body, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Along with the galton magnifier, ink and transplanter, and light, Eliazar began to compare the dactyl records of the corpse with those of the card.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man originally from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm to the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, whether he was indeed the Commander-in-Chief of Farc.
Search for tracks
For the dactyloscope from Sijin de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos showed to Eliazar González at the press conference of the operative service against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people assist in researching crimes such as theft or murder, and confirm the identity of the persons caught.
When caught, a lot of delinquents present fake papers or don't have papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator related that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief was leaning to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not designed to take fingerprints, but in this case we could get a full handprint and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicions in a murder case.
Recently, a man was found dead with bottles of alcohol around him.
The investigation revealed that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and the print on the bottle actually confirmed this.
Although it cannot be 100% confirmed that he was indeed a murderer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A fingerprint expert from the CTI explained that the objects are "wiped away with chemical or physical reactive agents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to collect them.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are not recorded anywhere," said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as it appears on the CSI television program.
Just like everything that glitters is not gold, not everything you touch leaves traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
'Indignation' Protests in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the space and moved to a nearby park.
The Occupy Wall Street movement provoked a New York City official on Tuesday when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square in the morning, then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters crowded Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get to thanks to a court order allowing the "indignant" to return to camp on the spot. The second part of the movement responded to the eviction by taking over a park in the north of the city, where there were further detentions.
“If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through rallies and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the “Own Wall Street” movement.
Bray said the "angry" response to the evictions ordered by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself had reached the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evictions and allowing protesters to continue to camp there.
In addition, "indignation" also took another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the grounds of the rectory in Trinity Church.
They managed to take up space for at least an hour, but then the police came and arrested some of the protesters. Bray did not know the exact number, but stated that he saw that the handcuffs had also been put on some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site. A delegation of religious leaders has also come to express their support and also to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed, with a court hearing expected on Tuesday to analyze the legality of the morning evacuation.
Some of the relocated protesters even handed out copies of the court order and even gave it to members who were guarding the square, triggering "some small clashes," Bray said, condemning the fact that some police officers were beating the protesters.
The injunction prohibits authorities from evicting members of the Ocupa Wall Street movement or using "laws that were published after the annexation began, or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they had previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to the court order, the city suspended the reopening of the public space and warned protesters that local laws do not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and approached because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the square to be evacuated because it was becoming "a place where people didn't go to protest but to break the law and in some cases to hurt others" because "some stores had received threatening letters" and "neighbors were concerned about the quality of their lives".
"The morning eviction was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of the American working people," added a spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "not valuing freedom of expression".
Representatives of the Ocupa Wall Street movement also said they planned to hold "major events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson to star in special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a lifeguard in "Baywatch", a bunny in "Playboy", the wife of year-old musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show of Canadian television.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from Internet home pornographic images, appears with her ex-husband, the engine of the "Mutley Crue", Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Baby Jesus in a manger.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian Indian comedian who recently hosted Charlie Sheena's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears on the scene.
Besides Anderson and Peterse, Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, will appear on CTV's special Christmas broadcast, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "a fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% due to household consumption, ending the period of falls that began in March
Since March last year, Japan’s economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has had to face since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put material losses at $300,000, a blow that heals well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of downs, the value of GDP between July and September was in such a position that it was possible to turn the page definitively: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - predict the highest growth rate compared to the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partially explained by the purchase of machines, which are necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Enterprises have increased their investments by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% compared to the period of January to March. This is the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on a momentum that forces us to use the crisis to step up or to rebuild infrastructures, and to use scarcity to start from scratch.
Japan has woken up, mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, due to increased spending on vehicles, trips, and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
The flows were entrusted to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the euro zone debt crisis and from worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but it is also a great burden for export businesses.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota and Sony attributed their weak results in July and September to the yen exchange rate.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government is cautious.
“We must be alert to the risks that remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase of the yen,” State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
The prospects are not really encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member states showed clear signs of an economic slowdown in September.
An indicator that predicts inflexibility in the world economy has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, down from 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even fallen below the average of 100, reaching 99.13 points.
Athens is once again spreading uncertainty.
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives won't sign any written commitment
With quick and risky margin guarantees and the uncertainty that has reigned again, Greece is becoming increasingly entangled in the labyrinth that is leading to the exit from the Great Debt Crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the “agreement” of the new transitional Greek government is due more to the demands of Brussels than to the true convictions of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period he was given at his appointment is likely to be short for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, stated that he would not support the new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand to call new elections by the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
The package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clear up any doubts about his position: "We have committed to help the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else".
The Conservative leader went a little too far in his speech to the EU and the IMF to unblock the $8 billion Athens urgently needs, but said he would not support or sign any commitment to austerity.
The European Commission, already furious at the impact that Papandreou's toying with the referendum, stressed yesterday that its demands are insurmountable: it will not unblock any aid unless a new government and leaders of major parties sign a "written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that Troika inspectors will return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" of 8 billion, but there is no definitive date.
Greek spinners have a little more to work on.
Queen Sofia: ‘There are tools for progress and hope’
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain has "achieved an important position at global level in terms of microfinance".
Yesterday, Queen Sofia recalled that the earth has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity. It is an instrument based on trust in man".
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th Global Micro-Loan Summit in Valladolid, believing that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operations "are absolutely necessary" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the goals to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, that is, the amount that sets the poverty threshold".
Spain will “continue to work” and expand its network of volunteers “in all corners of the planet and take this responsibility seriously”, said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, “will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women”, to whom these loans are intended in the first place.
"We have achieved a lot" and "many challenges are still ahead of us".
The micro-lending summit is intended to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform to support "fundamental goals".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015, and for 100 million families to be above the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of micro-loans spread to Spain and other countries around the world after “the pioneer idea of Muhammad Yunus embarked on this journey,” the queen said, adding that it was “an act of justice and the necessary recognition.”
She described the instrument's father as "an admirable idealist who set out on a journey to combat poverty". She became acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted with his loan policy on the spot.
This experience was followed by the first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings I was able to note the constant development, explained the Queen, who thanks to her support of this project earned the title of "head of the family" yesterday, which was awarded to her in Valladolid by the "poor movement".
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by calling on participants to engage in discussions and seek solutions to allow the fight against poverty to continue.
"The Ethical Imperative"
Trinidad Jiménez, the foreign minister, said solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must abide by.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only to the period of development, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a "serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty", and now more than ever, governments in developed countries must work in line with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to fall victim to austerity.
For Spain, micro-loans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to the people to whom everyone else is closing the door. The Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the participants in a city that "opens its doors to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
CDU proposes to elect European president on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) took place in Leipzig on Monday 14 November without any serious difficulties for Chancellor and Chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but only in the autumn, especially to satisfy party members who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps towards the Italians tomorrow to be lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission, tabled by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against, and 10 abstained.
A few minutes’ standing ovation at the end of Angela Merkel’s speech and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
According to the chancellor, “the time for change has come.”
This could be reflected in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage 'in order to give Europe a face'.
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, which was clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary move: Great Britain opposes it, and the CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same stance.
But the direction is set.
Likewise, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to assess each country’s weight on the board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in a strengthening of Germany’s weight.
Driven by concern to calm the climate inside her party, Merkel made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but did not seek to win Congress by talking about "small" European states or states in trouble willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
Two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What constitutes fraud in the event of incapacity for work?
After the subsidies, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 December, visiting the welfare office, where he will deliver a speech on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
Accompanying this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased austerity, but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose the fourth day of incapacity on private sector employees before they begin to take sickness benefits.
Clearly, without the consent of the company, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of wages, that is, at least 15% of their monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic reach: to give civil servants one day of unpaid incapacity for work (until now they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the right-wing majority is also launching a topic of fraud, this time focused on mischief linked to incapacity for work.
"The checks will be much more extensive and, moreover, if you are caught, you will be returned," Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem somewhat disproportionate to the truth about incapacity for work.
These have in fact been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and a political onslaught that has borne fruit.
The French are no more ill than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Care, daily reimbursements accounted for 5% of health care expenditures in 2008, with a total of 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity allowances and accidents at work, and 54% concerned incapacity for work, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of health care costs.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, the French had an average of 14.5 days of sick leave in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
An average that hides some deviations: another survey published in 2007 on job opportunities site Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed answered that they did not choose any day of sick leave.
Another study, this time conducted by sickness insurance institutions, clarifies that in 2010 37.8% of incapacity cases were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
Comparing them to their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone than elsewhere to incapacity for work.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS (National Research Centre) researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, total absenteeism (for health reasons or not) oscillated between 10% and 11.8% in France versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK, and 18% in the Netherlands.
Incapacity for work is only a small part of black work.
When it comes to fraud, these are only small in scale.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 has caused systematic checks to be carried out on incapacity for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM reported that with 1.5 million inspections, 13.8% of the 285,000 were carried out due to short-term incompetences "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incompetences of more than 45 days, 11% of cases were "unadapted or unauthorized" to 1.2 million checks, or 132,000.
So a total of 169 000 'unauthorised' cases per several million workers who have been incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than the number expressing the work on black.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent between 9 and 15 billion euros missing in the collection of taxes for the year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement new bailout plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to rebuild its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos delivered these words before parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to carry out this task.
“To get our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan,” he said as he delivered his first public speech at the start of a confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on 27 October will be the new government’s “main task”, because our country’s participation in the euro zone is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country’s public deficit would be “around 9%” of gross domestic product by the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
The right-wing leader, Antonis Samaras, on Monday voiced his support for the measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but said his party was not committed to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras said at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
We have agreed targets for deficit and debt reduction and the fight against waste, but we are opposed to any policy that would impede economic recovery.
Antonis Samaras responded to Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for the Economy and Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the envisaged measures, saying that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, experts say
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are denied death.
In the matter of palliative care, the commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives by the idea of refusing death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make decisions to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of a large report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The commission advises the government to change the criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if such a choice appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
A recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit compared the quality of death in 40 countries.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this figure is highest with 86% of those dying in hospital.
Regarding the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report draw conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about the criminal law concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Experts, who have also scrutinized all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, say there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to persons not competent or dissenting.
In contrast, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday more than the numerous cases of these violations in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legal.
"Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
“Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Downie said.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia.
Recall that according to an investigation conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia because they believe it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of life.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
When it comes to people who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear when it comes to maintaining or discontinuing patient care, the authors of the report say.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not punishable.
The Commission of Experts also requires that specialist doctors be educated to respect the end-of-life treatment refusal without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the matter of palliative or final pacification already widely used in Canadian health care facilities, the commission requires that it be considered euthanasia when it no longer serves the purpose of reducing physical pain, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations by other experts
Some medical law experts have already voiced their reservations about the findings of the Royal Canadian Society's expert report.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, has qualified the position of expert-signatories of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask to be helped to commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the résumé reports yesterday.
Deschamps also underlines that it seems as if the authors of the report put the autonomy of the person above all other values that shape the social fabric of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a "manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, is particularly doubtful about the dates of the report regarding the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damascus speaks of a "comployment"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria were intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russia’s support, resists them and speaks of a “complicity” against his country.
Two days after Syria’s suspension from the Arab League, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, countries bordering Syria, have taken a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan's King Abdallah II was yesterday the first ruler of an Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to put some forty civilians and members of the regime's military forces to death in Syria."
“If Bashar had his country’s interests at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the king said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that efforts to mediate with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
“Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to neighboring Syria, to which Turkey is applying an increasingly hard line.
The United States rejoiced in “strengthening the consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime’s dishonesty” following decisions by the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are using an increasingly harsher tone" against the repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces were killed in the southern Syrian city of Deraa.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed "in gunfights and concentrated gunfire in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, during a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country had “set out on a path out of the crisis.”
He also reacted to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step.”
Syria “will not bow,” he added, assuring that “competes plotted against Syria will not succeed.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently considering a "mechanism to protect civilians" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favorable to the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by a regime that he says is “paranoid.”
A new special League meeting is being convened tomorrow in Rabat to take a stand on the crisis resolution plan decided on December 2, which envisaged in particular the withdrawal of armies from the cities plagued by strife and the liberation of imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said yesterday that the Arab League’s decision was “wrong”, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while avoiding support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifice from Italians
Mario Monti, the next head of the Italian government, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include “victims” in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi’s government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of trade unionists and employers today.
He should form a relatively slim cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the proposed prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The consultation ends with Mario Monti introducing a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In "democracy, exact deadlines apply" when it comes to the preparation of the government and its program, he stressed, adding that he is "sure that the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns resurfaced after an unexpected slump in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should put together a team involving primarily technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics" in it as well.
He said he was confident the new government would last until 2013, the date of the next election.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said the new government would receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extreme urgency and with the aim of making Italy "a strong link again" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union believes that Rome, despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, will not achieve its goal of a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
Confindustria CEO Emma Marcegagli, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot meet deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, a "professor" symbolising, according to the authors of the editorials, "a call to seriousness" and "a different Italy", represents an "epoch change" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism".
The great unknown will be the life span of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has until April 2012 to place 200 billion euros worth of government bonds.
Soviet Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used for an atomic weapon, a US non-governmental organization specializing in atomic risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from that agency by the United Nations.
Last week, the IAEA shared its "serious concern" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the Institute of ISIS widely drawn from the IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked for three decades since the 1960s in the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was supposed to be engaged in the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was to leave the center to set up a "nano-diamonds" company in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties should have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he was supposed to work on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear indications that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based "on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked on this technology during a substantial part of his career as part of the country's nuclear weapons programme."
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes rise by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of crimes and offenses against Muslims increased by almost 50% between 2009 and 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence declined slightly or little increased.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49 percent increase over the 13 percent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 percent decrease in offenses against Jews, and a 14 percent overall increase in anti-religious crimes and delicts.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the decline in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes rise again," Human Rights First said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a senior executive at the organization.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to tackle these misdeeds,” he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reports of “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the Civil Rights era.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of followers, somewhat resembling its Facebook services.
New "activity" and "name" offers allow you to know better and directly the actions of others who follow you or whose responses ("tweets") you follow.
This lets you know if they allow you to follow posts, whether they sign in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "on a small percentage of users" in August before it was rolled out across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat unintelligible (RT for repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday pour recommender de suivre un autire utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus Facebook comparable a celse desici
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
“It’s pointless, it takes up a lot of space, and it’s too much like Facebook,” writes ’jemb123.
"The Activity feature will better help me follow some of the elements of my Twitter", posted by ’dannykronstrom.
Austria
The Golden Rule on Balanced Budgets
The government of a large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a "golden rule" of budget policy into the constitution to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's rating agencies (AAAs).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the close of the ministerial meeting, in a situation where Austria’s public debt is 74.6% above the criteria of no more than 60% set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and foreign minister.
Austria follows up on the request of the Euro Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the heads of state and government strongly requested that by the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of the balance of public accounts be written in the constitution or in the law of equal value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) every year, and starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP every year, while the Länder, as well as the municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt below the 60% target set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in the foreign exchange markets if he was to just keep strengthening.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find too much volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Y. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to the historical values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had only recently broken the dollar-to-dollar record set since 1945.
But only since then has it risen regularly supported by buying by investors who see it as a “safe haven” in uncertain times of the world economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen threshold close to the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports as it raises the price of Made in Japan products and lowers the value of revenue earned by Japanese firms from abroad when they convert them into their domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the north-east of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this increase in the yen will not yet kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third economic powerhouse resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% relative to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year, thanks to a survey of growth in exports and consumption of disaster-stricken households.
But the prime minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan."
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But Hirohide Yamaguchi, the institution’s vice-governor, warned that the BOJ had previously taken “appropriate measures” indicating that no additional currency weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its most recent meeting at the end of October, the Securities and Exchange Institute increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasury bills and raised the ceiling to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of amounts it devotes to the purchase of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
Euro area:
Prices are rising and stock markets are failing.
The risk of contagion to the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the eurozone’s stability, European stock exchanges are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC 40 index drops 1.4% to 3.064 points in 10 hours.
The Dax index is down 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"With new tensions surrounding the troubled euro zone loan yields, equity markets around the world continue to yield only part of the recent gains."
“Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of contagion,” explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker, as quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop, which it suffered due to market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe, and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stable,” said Mitsushige Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resumption of uncertainty about the future of the eurozone is hurting the currency itself, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570 at a 0.4% retreat.
According to the brokers, the currency backed out after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday suggesting the possibility of leaving the eurozone for countries that find themselves in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, Italian 10-year bonds yield 6.85%, and Spanish 10-year bonds yield 6.2%.
These tensions affecting interest rates in southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce concerns among market participants.
The head of Italy’s future government, Mario Monti, has called for time in the markets to correct the situation in Italy, threatened by the poisoning caused by the level of its debt.
Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on October 27 will be “a major task” for his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate line of markets when parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
Looking forward to the growth figures for the euro area
Statistics show that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised downward figures for the second quarter to a fall of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
During the same period, Germany registered a growth of 0.5% from its side.
The first forecasts for the entire eurozone are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is one subject that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, it is energy policy.
Electricity availability and price have a direct impact on purchasing power and business competitiveness.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only succeed if all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will cause a doubling of the demand for electricity between now and 2050 if we do not want to deprive a significant part of the world’s population of an important part of life.
At the same time, there will have to be a shortage of fossil fuels in order to continue to produce electricity, while not forgetting the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a topic that is currently disappearing from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear power.
But this is not the case in Belgium, which is subjecting its decision to the need to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor in Switzerland, which considers it right to build only the latest generation power plants.
In contrast, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by resuming the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant disaster.
If the German renewable energy model is ever presented as an example, reality contradicts it.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported mainly from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal-fired power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European wind power champion, of which it consumes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which makes CO2 emissions and prices of Danish electricity higher by 65% and 50%, respectively, than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay an electricity bill 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised economy energy costs are a key factor for competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping industry on national territory, French businesses enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful declarations about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they do not fundamentally oppose this energy, as opinion polls show.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 downstream jobs.
The strong export sector has attracted a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises to international markets, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France had decided to leave the nuclear power plant, it would have sacrificed a considerable number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have lost 6 billion euros a year, which the country receives for exporting nuclear equipment and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while its manufacturer was scheduled to go bankrupt?
When solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magic source for energy production, and even that there is no diabolical one.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable energy installations by the French industrial group AREVA testifies to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear power, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision over existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in the blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island occurred in normal conditions of operation and remained free of human sacrifice and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama was caused by reactor concepts and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this crash, just as it did with the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step, and of the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers, is that an EPR reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While everyone who wishes to build a nuclear power plant considers it, halting its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to AREVA Group and EDF’s competitors and freeing the way for them to take a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so crucial to our country’s economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the congestion of the police, the courts and the administration subjected to the politics of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of the "land of human rights" that France boasts.
More recently, it was an administrative harassment directed at foreign students that became topical when the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of May 23) said that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waitresses".
But so far, it has rarely been discussed at the angle of the economy.
There is a broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
Jacques Chirac declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and on the left Michel Rocard, saying in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invasion by hordes of Polish plumbers into French territory was shared to the right and to the left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that we deign to give to immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande confines himself to banalities when he states that joint development will make it possible to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be valid in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages, and employment in countries that accept immigrants.
Reducing immigration cripples growth and hurts employment.
Concerns about the effects caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and put pressure on them to lower their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more of a top-up than substitutes for French workers by doing jobs in understaffed sectors.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants make the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would cause a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to welfare systems in European countries, averaging 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labor Organization estimates that in Germany, one immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of ?150,000 to public budgets in his or her lifetime.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his desire to go for the missing percentage of growth “with his teeth out.”
The teeth used to repel immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, European democracy remains to be thought through
Democracy is a rare and very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, for even though it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the tragedies of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and the colonels in Greece during the 20th century.
Some people may have believed that it would be enough to make the choice and carry it out in the most direct way possible for democracy to triumph over its enemies.
Napoleon knew that it was easy to think.
Universal suffrage, even if it is a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become "an instrument of oppression," as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control by power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as and from the beginning of the crises of politics and democracy.
Admitting the error of the Greek yes-no referendum will have the value of a double revelation in this respect: the revelation of the need for a major return to political power, but also the revelation of a disturbing sense of its impossibility, its unsuitability.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the Democratic struggle have shifted today, and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer firing in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we demand a series of national referendums organised according to necessity and disorganised.
Bianka exposed to a European absolute monarch or a leap with bound feet into the empty nationalist depths: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we know where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
The management of the European project of democratic sovereignty must be returned as a matter of urgency.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of market government and prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will presuppose decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is strongly demanding a European economic government.
Fair enough.
But to think so without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new impasse.
We must take on a new phase of European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" republicans.
A revolution in interests was not enough.
This lesson continues.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a Europe of more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the world trade fair for smart cards will open in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 should end with an increase in global sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, phones with a SIM card) by 11% to more 6 billion units.
The most supporting segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay on public transport or make purchases simply by approaching the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total smart card market (6.925 million cards).
After being in the APEC for a long time, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been issued.
But big chain stores work for two.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million MasterCard contactless cards this year.
In order to get a higher gear, banks need to handle their clients from now on.
“Two large French companies have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their clients in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first stage to the means of payment of the future: a mobile phone.
Today, only a small number of devices are equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.
"They've picked up delays".
"But their true expansion should take place next year".
“For 2012, we estimate their sales worldwide to be between 80 and 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test in the city of Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
The iPhones of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société Générale also announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone without contact.
The terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria.
Paris is concerned about ties between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing suspicions that there are ties between the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerien Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s deputy foreign minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even admitted that Algiers had “received certainty about it from now on.”
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a lot of cooperation between them," he explained without specifying further.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being abducted by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers in an operation carried out by special French forces.
In the rubble following the raid, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
The Terrorist Axis
Analysis of calls made leads to several individuals in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one that leads to a Nigerian who has resided for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is said to be close to the AQMI and sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram".
"But it's possible".
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is manifesting itself more and more actively," Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo said in a statement.
In recent months, this “support” has been more and more evident in the development and manifestation of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Fast Success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin" in the language of haoussa, approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is a quick success.
The sect is politicized and demands strict adherence to Islamic sharia law, while its adherents launch a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars, and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extremely active and intensified their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government’s response remains the same.
The army encircles the city, resulting in 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, the founder of the sect, is caught and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and abandoning its northern role.
On Christmas Eve 2010, an attack in Jos killed 80 people, followed by another in Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks police headquarters in their first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now of concern to all security specialists.
Now that al-Qaeda has surrounded the Islamic Maghreb in Mali, and the Iger and Somalis of al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new danger to the continent.
Speaking to President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé last week in Nigeria, he said France was on alert and ready to "hand over all the information".
The World According to Presidential Candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in oversimplification and ignorance on issues related to China, Iran, or helping Israel.
Can a crisis-stricken America manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
When listening to presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have been repeating the vociferous statements and brief guidelines on foreign policy that have traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or aid to Israel are intertwined.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the Republican “Grand Old Party,” threatened to call the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and accuse them of “manipulating their currency,” a theme rife in America by the migration of entire sections of its industry to Asia.
Even worse, if this must include the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sort of sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost faltered at an attitude that “smoothed” emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman, who is last in the polls, remains unlistening.
In the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in fanfare.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, demonstrates an embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China's military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry, and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
Everyone is far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan had simple ideas, too, and yet he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus attribute to him the label of weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population views President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
Since Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to obliteration.
And with the argument that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking in the right place.
Nord Stream, the new port of entry for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline connecting Eastern Europe directly to Russia and running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to work.
It must supply gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to properly celebrate the event.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned the control valve around to control Russian gas entering the Western European grid.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will flow into Western Europe each year through the first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the state of Mecklenburg-Pomorania.
The second pipeline, which must be completed by the end of 2012, will supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, an amount equal to all French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route is already being mentioned.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge building has the character of a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly objected to the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being routed by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
All of a sudden, these two countries are losing some of their power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats to close its access to Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most forcefully when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that it is a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe, through its support for this Russian project, has gained greater certainty in its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe’s energy, because the project has created rifts between Europeans from the East and the West.
Only five years ago, Russia managed to impose its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich, gas-intensive Western states, whose deposits are coming to an end.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us,” Fillon confirmed at the opening ceremony of the pipeline, demonstrating at what point the big gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The undersea pipeline is made of steel fitted with a concrete sheath to protect it from anchors of naval vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction it was necessary to avoid minefields originating from the time of World War II.
“For security reasons, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens Muller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted anywhere by valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project managers rejected it when the Swedes were little eager to see the Russian state-owned company settle permanently off their shores.
"In the event of a fault, we will stop the passage of gas in less than 1 minute," says Jens Muller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline leaks into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, since the welds were designed so that the leak would occur once every 100,000 years.
The control of the pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot towed by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
At the destination, after a full three-day journey at a speed of 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information on possible deformations of the metal parts.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom's leading position is holding a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is headquartered in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company for five years with a contract, which can be renewed, all of its gas transportation capacity.
“Gazprom will benefit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens Mäller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided from 30% by shareholders and from 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment costs soared to $240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be reimbursed, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline rises from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the gas exit gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to German gas pipelines.
As of last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, this will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - branded notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to once again provide the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its leaves of faded white color, as if aged over time.
After all, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, will at that time decide to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes charge of the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is used, for example, to modify the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought back an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand’s leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is distant from the secret production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create an artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook will attract businessmen as well as students or professionals.
The image of Moleskine's notebook includes that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now has almost a hundred, and since 2008 it has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and, through the FNAC chain of stores, to small boutiques in the middle of cities, where he has been able to assert his identity.
“We have been following the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the tumultuous development of e-mails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also presented new scrapbook records resembling a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura, diversifying its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand extends to a wide range of carriers.
A success that aroused envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment funds of SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today marks the 15th week of employment for the disabled.
Despite the voluntarist public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled persons is even twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it disheartening?
"No, underscores Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of the Handicapped".
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At the time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher."
"However, there is still much to be done."
It must be said that many obstacles remain for the unemployed disabled before they start working.
These are elderly people: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
They are low-skilled: 80% do not have a high school diploma, and of the 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% among the disabled compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria which make it particularly difficult to return to work and which constitute the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There remain unsaid ways of thinking that certainly evolve, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that executives surveyed had a "weak level of knowledge about disabled people" with an "over-imagination of people on a wheelchair and psychological or mental deficiencies".
As a result, private businesses with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the 6% employment goal for disabled workers set out in the 1987 law.
The last known figures, which date back to 2008, indicate a status equal to 2.6%.
“We’re now at around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization charged with charging businesses that don’t comply with the law.
This is evidenced by the number of "punished" businesses, as well as the amounts paid, which fell from 59,000 offenders between 2007 and 2011 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, Pierre Blanc explains."
"But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Labor Department, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "How lucky"
Before they challenge the French (Bleus) on Tuesday evening (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have not hidden the pleasure that this friendly match will bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was a collusion between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after an angry gesture by his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian coach gave only words of praise to his player.
"I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward", assures the French player Lille.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and those of the national team, "it is one and the same, he justifies himself."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Gambling, sparing against Romania on Thursday night because of this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "shine on".
The term “joy” should not be forgotten.
To play against Bleus, whom he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
All the more so because opposite "are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)".
“We were crossing right away.”
"To be able to play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
Leekens also said "proud".
"Proud" to fight "match - holiday".
"Proud to also note in the quality of the 'neighbors' that France, just over a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna, 'has once again become a very high-level team.'"
"Laurent Blanc did a great job," he gasped.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see a plane with the French heading... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians will become big," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next games." Including against France.
Portugal is very self-confident.
Portugal coach Paulo Bento is very optimistic about starting a match against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
The Portuguese national football team, which has been at the helm since 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is one match left and one opponent - Bosnia.
Knowing Friday's result (0-0) in the hell of Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of dominance, but it was not able to score such a rare goal to relieve him.
“It’s a good result, but there’s a risk because we didn’t score.”
But at home on their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident that they will advance in front of an audience that should create a boiling cauldron there, even if the match definitely seems to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but keenly thinking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
“We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz.
An indecisive match in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
An indecisive match may be enough for Bosnians, who also need to score a goal.
“It’s a good result, but there’s a risk because we didn’t score,” Bento said.
“We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities.”
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so that "they don't give them time to think."
Good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
