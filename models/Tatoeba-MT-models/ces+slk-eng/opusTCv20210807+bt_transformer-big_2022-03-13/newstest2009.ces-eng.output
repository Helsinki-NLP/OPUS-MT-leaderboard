Prague Stock Exchange plunged to a minus at the end of trading
After a sharp fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange has followed up on its Monday decline since the beginning of trading on Tuesday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the stock market is falling on Wall Street.
Even in our country, the market’s reaction to the result of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector.
The fall of shares in Asia
Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic crash on Tuesday, although indices eventually wiped out some of the losses over the course of the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index took almost 4% off during trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the drop to around 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Sydney shares lost more than five percent, but eventually fell to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan’s stock market fell 3.6 percent, according to the index.
“The timing of the rescue operation in the U.S. is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, sets its monetary policy independently, i.e. without dependence on the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has the same interest rates as the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said lawmakers should return to negotiations and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Other countries are also at risk of being affected.
A Bloodbath of American Shares
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was expected to cost as much as $700 billion.
The lawmakers ignored President George W. Bush’s call to back the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices saw their biggest crash in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent, with the most recent decline on a similar scale in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal had not passed in the House, the index found itself in free fall.
Congress backs down: U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
U.S. Congressional leaders and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the U.S. financial system.
It will be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a $700 billion bailout for the U.S. financial system.
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must finalize some details of the deal before they can publish the bill and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
The Senate may vote on the plan on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that a rescue plan would be approved should be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, there will be a "sobering up" due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which markets can be helped in practice as well.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We’ve settled our differences about what a market stabilization package looks like,” said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive shape to the government fund.
It should buy unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which pull financial companies into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis is having a major impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, said lawmakers are working to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where Congress’s decision could affect Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two houses of Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether they can hold talks at the last minute on a problem.
Legislators hope it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will make a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has demanded.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels the program is failing to fulfill its function, in a sequence of another $100 billion, and later the final $350 billion.
Bush applauds progress in negotiations
The president can veto the decision, but Congress can override it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds to buy bad mortgage securities, whose value has plummeted because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, has remained.
“We worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and praised "the two-part effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restrictions on gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed to be responsible for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing concessions, timing of funding the plan.
The new law will also restrict the so-called gold parachutes for company directors participating in the program, and set up a committee to oversee the fund.
It should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard and made great progress towards a deal that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on help for homeowners who are having trouble paying back.
The government should negotiate new installments on the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of installments for borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological support
According to chief economist David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
“This is because we don’t know what the mechanism is and at what price the distressed assets will be bought.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government share their losses," Marek told news server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so important, according to Mark.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that they will consecrate it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on the approval is the most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
Battle on the knife edge: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It seems to me that it is better to just buy a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons to get a separate player.
The choice entirely depends on the method of use and the demands of the future owner.
It’s hard to get a high-end record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
On the one hand, such music products are not based on LPs and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if you have vinyls with art rock, jazz or blues on your shelves, you probably dream of such a turntable at least.
It is the same with music on the go, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
It may be unacceptable for someone to spend eight thousand crowns on the player, just as a Pink Floyd fan will hardly bite the headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life.
Some top music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobiles do not even happen.
No other device is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephony and texting, it can play music and video, record both, has a better, worse camera and can even navigate.
And taking into account smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph anything.
The versatility of mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Hardly any cell phone can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
In the case of cheap mobile phones, expect that they will not play for more than a few hours.
If you still call now and then, get one more charger to work for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the worst will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem arises when recording music on mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
With the exception of iPods, you do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players already create their own music library sorted by artist name, album name, genre or user rating.
Some devices display only the tree structure of directories similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles are more capable
When choosing a particular device, be particularly interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output, and, of course, comfort of operation.
If your music is primarily a backdrop and you listen to it every day for a short time, for example, in a tram, you just need any mobile phone that plays MP3.
Almost any cell phone can do that.
You don’t even have to look too closely at what music formats your phone or player can do.
MP3 can handle all of them, and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and besides it, the vast majority of devices can handle music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online, for example.
Just visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) and buy a song or album via the mobile internet.
This service itself could be a strong argument for the acquisition of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is mostly limited to fast-fermented radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (via GSM, internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their mobiles with them.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you can feel the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wired handsfree.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which has almost every mobile, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music mobiles will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than $3,000.
For three and four thousand crowns you will get a very decent walkman.
However, most of the time you will be limited by the absence of output on ordinary headphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones even with a 3.5 mm socket for conventional headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can handle really everyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of the control with the previously common cassette player or turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mistakenly turned on mobile internet and subsequently a giant account for data transmission.
What device to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the appropriate card, you can fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, go for Cowon, Creativa, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, opt for specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and thus the comfort of operation is closer to a separate MP3 player.
The furthest in the industry is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series phones have the same user interface as separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), MP3 players will take you away from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing here - a virtual operator that would make the classic ones cheaper.
Maybe he won't be long.
We have written about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe on Mobil.cz many times.
This was also confirmed by ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really like to get into the fight.
It may sound paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and penetration well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (ČTÚ), has often pointed out that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network probably does not have much chance (after all, it would be difficult to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant reduction in prices, to which classical operators also had to respond.
Even before the introduction of pikes such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market, similar voices were heard in the UK as in our country.
However, it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we don’t have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the operator has managed to reach more than 100,000 customers and become the country’s fifth largest operator.
The financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, U:fona in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, a bet on a new target group can also be a pretty good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"The right guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could catch on in our country.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone’s press secretary, doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segmented approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the financial group Penta, said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything they can to prevent any potential competitor from emerging.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been hidden for a long time by the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in offering our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them," said Pavel Kaidl, press spokesperson for the group.
So maybe it’s time for better days.
From the unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator is expected by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room for a full-fledged virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any subject with a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2 told Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, spokesperson for T-Mobile, said: “We have not yet seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which we can build further.”
He added: “By the end of the year, it will be difficult for any virtual operator to appear on T-Mobile’s network.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table to be able to think in this short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "By negotiating with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, lead to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when operators want something, they can pull together is evidenced by the scramble around the creation of U:fona.
Probably the biggest pressure towards CTU came at the time of the creation of U:fona from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the CTU website.
However, U:fon is now useful as an argument for not allowing a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and especially on his services."
Given this approach of mobile operators, however, the complete lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is striking.
It is not just CTU's position, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
However, he took a typical position on the whole issue.
"The virtual operator's entry into the mobile market would be possible after a contract was concluded between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential candidates was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the Office of the Czech Republic said in response to our question.
It is not surprising that such a statement is made by the operators.
It is more than reasonable for an authority to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position in the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: “In foreign countries, where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in prices for mobile telephone services.”
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices is clearly not one of the interests of the Office.
In fact, what is shocking about the whole case is the touching harmony of the three mobile operators that results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is just a coincidence is entirely self-evident.
Just like the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations, it is certainly just a matter of chance and fierce competition.
"The Office did not find any signs of anti-competitive conduct in this matter and therefore has no reason to interfere in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have a correspondingly increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary tools to open the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to be lacking even to the telecommunication regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of a dominant market position is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are the only market in terms of competition.
Of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - to create a virtual operator, the consent of the network operator is always required.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment it must necessarily be dominant.
Even if we do not allow this argument, it should at least be a warning for the Office that three mobile operators are acting in a strikingly similar way.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
Blaming responsibilities on CTU is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications, which the Office puts its hands away from the whole matter.
We have met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, CTÚ’s powers in the area of competition in telecommunications were not able to be enforced, although many experts had hoped to improve the situation.
That’s something that people need to know more about, but it seems to be their interests elsewhere.
It happens when no one is looking.
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies issuing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephone services.
The prices of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic business customer to the operator, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, you will receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar reselling.
"If there were cases that you are talking about, it could be a violation of the terms and conditions that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Kemrová said.
However, it is unlikely that such activity will not reach the responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators opposes such a procedure.
They make significant profits from the activities of these companies and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to the possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they can not fully dispose of it as normal customers of mobile operators."
That’s what should be weird at least.
In addition, another question arises for the Office.
If mobile operators are turning a blind eye to a similar process, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the Office has relatively strong powers to reveal similar activities, and if it does not want to, it may not be satisfied with the operators’ explanation that they have no idea about this and their terms and conditions prohibit it.
When will we not be the most expensive
As has been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable decrease in prices for services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, regulators have intervened at this very moment to defend not the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they have achieved that the first virtual operator was created and others have flocked to it.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are shifting the case like a hot potato.
From our experience, we can not get rid of the impression that the lack of competence in these cases more than suits them.
But let's not waste any more time.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator is coming to us really soon, the Czech mobile market may be starting up again.
If any of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the Office to remain indifferent to rejecting (discrimination) other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The Czech national anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where Is My Home on the occasion of the Czech Statehood Day.
The anthem was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choral performance and instrumental version.
The song was sung by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the adaptations of the anthem are Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymen.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had deliberately chosen singers with young, representative voices to sing solo.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them and the choir had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they resonated," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where is My Home was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it for their own.
After the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the “new” anthem?
Prague Public Transport will ride on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will go down in the history of the Prague Public Transit Company as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, it can be purchased by about 100,000 people who own an Opencard smart card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it uploaded to their smart card at the information centres and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations Muzeum, Mustek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Since yesterday, coupons can also be purchased via the Internet on the website of Dopravní podnik www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers in the afternoon.
Those who start using the e-shop can definitely forget about the dispensing windows in the metro stations, where they have had to regularly stand in long lines for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon online and put it on their Opencard in one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers are provided with a desk with trained staff that will help those interested with online shopping and will also upload the purchased coupon to their card," said Martin Opatrný, spokesperson for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard also in self-service vending machines, which are mounted in several metro vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket markers and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," said Opatrný.
The coupon will check the driver’s seat with a vending machine
Operation of the machines, which will start to work tomorrow, is simple.
Just insert an Opencard chip into them and the previously paid coupon will upload to it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow apply not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, which go to the capital mainly residents of Central Bohemian municipalities.
"In trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, conductors are equipped with card readers to determine the time and zone validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal, of the Ropid organization, which compiles timetables for Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the cash register of the driver.
When boarding, it is necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This way the driver will check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," added Drápal.
Passengers who do not ride suburban buses and do not remember when their coupon expires can head back to the self-service vending machines, where the coupons on the card are recorded.
Here, information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the device display.
The Sudetenland wanted a referendum.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the incorporation of Šumava into the United States.
It follows from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is said that in 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This follows, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Science Library.
The Germans in Český Krumlov are asking the US president not to allow the "Sumava County" - taken by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly, and we want to be really sure in words that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, signed with the words “People who care about the fate of Šumava.”
Since joining Czechoslovakia supposedly gives Sudeten Germans - with knowledge of the Czech national character - hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter to the American president ask that he take over the protectorate over Šumava for the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that you, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, would give this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and disproves minorities and nothing but nothing to contribute to the victory of the Allies," the letter said.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of the vengefulness of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had allegedly doubted the thinking of the Germans in Šumava, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the Šumava County on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately illustrates the expectations of Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Czech Germans must have at least suspected that it would be their removal from the republic, few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
During the war, he served as a German in the Navy in the Baltic.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would be able to use Czech," said Chalupa.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war did not expect to be removed from the republic on the basis of Beneš’s decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
An emotional campaign to attack drivers
The most expensive road safety event in Czech history.
Even so, it would be possible to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček’s office expects her to discourage dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, and on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and drinking alcohol at the wheel.
And remind them to fasten their seatbelts before they leave.
He wants to reach into the conscience primarily young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And there's the word "you'll pay" in a pool of blood.
This is supposed to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of inattention with his own life.
Audiences will be "scared" of the spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of accident victims can commonly be seen.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and a whip on the driver
"The system of sugar and whips applies to the driver.
Sugar for them is that when they run on red, for example, they save time.
A whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says traffic psychologist Martin Kořán from Na Homolce Hospital.
That is why there is a need for information campaigns in the press, and especially negative advertising, according to psychologists.
According to him, blackboards are less effective, which alert the driver to the danger.
"If a static sign warning of danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the surroundings and drivers will not pay attention to it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all of the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published in Yedioth Ahronoth on Monday.
"We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the daily.
“We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similar percentage to the Palestinians, because without that there will be no peace,” he said.
He added that any return would include East Jerusalem.
“Anyone who wants safety in Jerusalem and especially doesn’t want tractors or bulldozers running over their feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to two attacks in the city in July in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "special solutions for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites" that lie within the Old City.
"Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he further stressed.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for a peace deal with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“I am not proposing to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan,” he said.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to win the Golan.
They will have to relinquish their current relationship with Iran; they will have to relinquish their relationship with Hezbollah; they will have to relinquish the ongoing support they provide to Hamas terrorism, al-Qaeda and jihad in Iraq.”
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, they can't walk on a long-distance bus.
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether stewards and passengers could move on the bus while driving.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward’s activity is in violation of the Road Traffic Act,” said Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a 22-year-old stewardess last week, appears to have been caused by a truck driver crossing the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats.
However, the bus may crash or brake sharply, even when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with standing places according to the technical certificate.
If it is not homologated on the bus, the passenger must be seated.
The Student Agency long-distance buses do not have a parking space; the company director Radim Jančura confirmed this.
"We discussed this with the ministry and initially did not allow the movement of passengers.
Then they called it off and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving, if they have their seat," he said.
The Steward's Law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward's role - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term conductor of the vehicle; it does not define his rights and obligations," adds spokesperson Hanzelka less unambiguously.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law treats the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed a parking space in the homologation.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are places for standing and limited maximum speed, intercity with places for standing with a higher allowed speed, and long-distance without places for standing with a maximum allowed speed, and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says an expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see a major problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
“There is not much danger when driving smoothly, the situation can be compared to service on airplanes.
Even here it is not certain when the turbulence will come and the stewardess may hit her head."
“If the bus brakes too hard, the laws of physics apply.
Just like in a city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be dealt with by the carrier's internal regulations," he says, and he also thinks that, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the services
The Student Agency offers the services of stewards as the only bus carrier.
They employ two hundred of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the stewardship profession is risky, I will cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can be delivered to passengers upon check-in.
It would also save costs,” he said.
The lack of stewards in his cars was justified by the Asian director Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to the SA.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been against that from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some kind of fatal accident," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There has been a terrible tragedy
A young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who worked for the company for two years, died in an accident on the line to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably strayed from the parking lane without the use of a rudder and blocked the way of the bus.
His driver tried to avoid abrupt maneuvers, but slammed his right front against him.
That two places reserved for rest of stewards were sold out, Jančura refuses.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company is going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the verdict of the court, but also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Modification of the law?
Not in sight
The regulation of the law, which has been worked on for over a year by a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport, could help to clarify the movement of stewards on board the bus.
“However, it has not reached any specific conclusion.
Buses do not even solve much, but rather a point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of a mobile phone while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards to be something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers," concludes spokesperson Hanzelka, adding that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and labour safety authorities.
The hope of Dusseldorf is Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from WestLB’s board of directors to the bank’s employees.
The merger of the units of this Dusseldorf monetary institution with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt will create a "central institution of the financial group of savings banks for trade on capital markets," read the letter, which was made public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring a "competence set" of long-term returns to the transaction.
In general, such a connection can be a decisive impulse to further pooling in the sector of regional banks.
Such texts arise when the Board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
WestLB is under a lot of pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose message to the provincial government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future, is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which customers of savings banks are familiar with for their investment funds, and WestLB, of whatever kind, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas said at the end of August that he did not see any sense in the merger of his Mainzer Landstrasse bank with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is supported by one half of the Landesbank and the savings banks associations, has entrusted the Board with conducting discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be a capital market transaction or part of it.
But the talks have only just begun, say the financiers.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the more important employers on the financial market in Frankfurt, is not mentioned for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked for a moment that Deka-Bank might merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and with Bank Helaba.
In the end, there was nothing of this troika.
Shortly after the merger plans became public, the Hessian state government spoke out against the participation of Helaba Bank.
Neither of the other two banks were so close.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was instead acquired by Landesbank Baden-Wurttemberg from Stuttgart.
Despite this, there have been repeated speculations about the Deka-Bank’s connection with the Landesbanks.
However, in recent times, the Board of Directors of Helaba has been negatively commenting on the speculation about the connection of his financial house with others.
Independently, however, it seems to mature the conviction that the convergence of the various banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the Bavarian state assembly elections, BayernLB’s connection with the Landesbank Baden-Wurttemberg could be the first to take shape.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers should increase, it gradually loses possible partners for such a connection.
In the south, she would only play the second violin, despite the fact that she still faces the financial crisis significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of savings banks and giro banks, which has an 85% stake in Helaba, banned the connection to WestLB earlier this year.
That would be Nord LB.
However, geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how closely the business models of individual institutions work together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of regional banks has not yet been answered by the German Savings Bank Association and giro banks.
Everything could also end with WestLB being dismantled, which, of course, nobody in this institution wants.
That is why the letter from the local board of directors says that it is trying to “comprehensive solution” for the whole banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual folders with Deka-Bank, time will show.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "weekend with Italy"
It's the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena will be there as his girlfriend, so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter Kaiser barrel, stands a stronger beard and two hundred tourists at Oktoberfest proves how deep tones can give his throat.
Elena smacks Lucu first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses will depart this evening at 23.45 marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, while one bus is exclusively operated by Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing their flag, celebrating at night.
And out loud like that, says Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
Marc, who is wearing a long coat with a fur lining and glasses with wide silver frames, owns the three buses.
He has been going to Oktoberfest with them for five years, this year he is organizing three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 10.30 departure back.
Overnighting would only mean unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast with Kaiser beer, brewed exactly according to the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses depart into the night, after the road towards "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus stops and the passenger sleeps.
They are doing well and they will still need their strength.
It stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where a number of other buses with Italian number plates take another break on the 8 motorway just outside Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 a.m., there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives his last speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First, wear a yellow hat.
It says "Oktoberfest" on the left, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
“When the door to the beer tent opens, run!” exclaims Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so as not to interfere, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, spread out over the space!"
The price is 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tips.
"Show the security guards that we're being polite.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Three: "Be back here tonight at 10:30 sharp!" Do you understand?
And up on Wiesn, a space with beer tents.
Along the way, a member of the group hangs yellow hats as signs on trees, signs and even on the election poster of a large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for withdrawal.
The weekend with the Italians is known as the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Exact figures on the number of visitors are not available; 50,000 are said to be making their way across the Alps and crashing into beer tents, with 10% of all visitors said to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
A number of Munich police will be joined by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains national statistics, in which Italians take first place before the British (about 60 hits) and Austrians (about 80), with approximately 200 medical treatments.
Especially popular with Italians is the Hofbräu tent.
Sleepless Nights for Creditors Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is a good thing that the politician used the word “relatively” and incorporated into his statement the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared from crisis development.
Because it happened last weekend.
The Dax-listed finance house specialising in Hypo Real Estate (HRE) real estate financing will receive a multi-billion dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan will go up to 35 billion euros.
The interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only on the amount actually spent.
The money comes from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
The state financier has, according to a newspaper report, been extremely short-term refinancing for long-term projects for which he has lent money, which is now impossible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve shrank by 95% to 2.37 million euros and the equity ratio fell slightly from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Current revenues and net proceeds from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, revenues from the increased value of receivables and certain securities, as well as from the abolition of reserves for credit trading, fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenues from compensation for subsequent clearing costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from interest compensation under the Tax Code and for the mediation of business for group companies was a 16 percent decrease on the revenue side even more moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier burned himself on mortgages for sole traders, which were then excluded from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Because there was too little money in classical state financing, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to write something off of the value of its subsidiary, and these write-offs will have a "fundamental material effect" on the calculation of the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have vaguely allowed themselves to hear.
There will be no dividend.
It was cut by two-thirds in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since Depfa's takeover.
It relies more heavily than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank lending has practically dried up as banks guard liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually needs short-term refinancing funds for part of Depfa’s loan portfolio - about 50 billion euros.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial need is covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the firm is protected "from the influence of international money markets currently largely incapacitated".
Other sources have said that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE, said that Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group in the market is now ensured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors hope for.
But given the dynamism and elusiveness of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely possible that the loan should not be completely used up.
However, the opposite cannot be excluded.
After the bank appeared to be facing insolvency late Sunday afternoon, it cannot, even tentatively, calm the passions.
The share price fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, the bond rates were well kept.
While senior debt has barely moved, secondary bond rates are losing significantly.
This applies in particular to bonds of the former subsidiary of the Wurttemberg Hypo and logically bonds with a maturity beyond 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood according to the stability of the international financial system after the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it to the firm by taking over Depfa.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of the securities within their due date.
But there may also be what almost no one dares to hope for now - a financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, due to the news coming at the same time as this partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now become mere legitimate hope.
This is especially likely to prepare long-term lenders for a series of sleepless nights when they decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors can use the cut-off line at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to exchange-rate returns of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the Secret of the Box Bento
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to introduce herself on her first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls begin to snigger: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows this word from the manga. On her new blog about exchange, she talks about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was scared on the way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way, but luckily I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not as strict as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to meet after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine begins a short session with the teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But before class started, I should have introduced myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I wasn't in school uniform yet, I wore my host mother's old skirt, plus a blouse, blue knee-highs, and black leather boots.
So, dressed like this, I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sajónara Woše Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that point, I was very happy that I had started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering and giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word 'kawaii'.
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly got to my place.
The girl next to me smiled a lot, considering it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was relatively quiet, but when the gong came, they literally buried me.
They were talking over each other and giggling and asking me about the possible and the impossible - and yet it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their benta.
My host mom also made me a lunch box - and that's different from boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit, and some fish in tofu batter.
I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
What's for sure is that everything's really good.
Well, except for the salt-laden plums, br!
Benta in Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives the boy a bento prepared by herself, which in this case is especially artistically arranged, and hopes that the boy will get to know him better during a snack at the break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I’ll see it here too.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
I have loved reading manga for years.
And to get a better understanding of these comics and their culture, I started learning Japanese a little bit.
I knew that one day I would have to come here.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
When a rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals have feelings.
But how can they be verified to feel the same when they behave like us?
The online magazine "Edge" has been publishing the contributions of well-known scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it, when we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we start dealing with a different kind and open up the issues of perception or consciousness in general, we enter an impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it will do what many other animals do: pretend to be dead, flee, or attack.
Humans behave in a similar way, from which some scientists infer a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe in that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the experience of animals.
This is partly because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always involve the prefrontal cortex (because of its contribution to short-term memory and executive or control functions).
This large area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and appears to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, between knowing who we are and being able to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that man is different even from other primates.
Another dramatic feature could be the linguistic nature of man: because so much of his perception is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude the animals.
But even if language did not matter, language would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably be different from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, we cannot even measure ourselves on the basis of our own experience, for the sake of special hardware, we are faced with great problems in exploring it.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to study processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach by Christof Koch and Francis Crick focuses on the neural correlates of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but perhaps they are not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of a non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I deduce them from the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of a defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) utilizes operational memory.
Seen from this angle, the sensations are closely intertwined with those areas of the cortex that are characteristic of primates, and especially humans.
In connection with linguistic nature, a fine gradation of perception arises, because by means of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states in order to attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in areas of the cortex and brain stem devoted to body sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in the sensations perceived by multiple animal genera.
In theory, I can’t argue with that, but I think it’s unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt by both organisms in the same way: But how is it possible to verify, says Pankseep, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the conformity of experiencing.
It’s true that neural comparisons take us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, while cockroaches and brains do.
But is the brain stem responsible for the feelings?
And even if it could be proved in man: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are likely to be fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and language), I prefer to examine emotional behavior rather than the emotional perception of rats.
Anyway, in this case, we can see progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
As with rats, I do not examine language and consciousness, nor do I examine feelings, after all, I do not know if they exist.
It may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than throw myself against the wall repeatedly.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said preparations would soon be directed directly by the president and prime minister.
“The government sees UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to hold the European Championship together with Poland,” Vasjunyk said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the early execution of the schedule for the construction or redevelopment of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are lagging behind.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will decrease from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," Ukrainian Federation President Grigory Surkis said.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN union was removed and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
“We assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that this step will not lead to a loss of preparation for the 2012 European Championship.”
Several teams from the Premier League were sentenced to forced relegation last season due to manipulations, eventually even having to be hastily relegated to the start of the league.
Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to do an ad for a new movie, she talked about private things - and now she's in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan referred to her ex-boyfriend Dennis Quaid as a marital wrecker.
He rages and strikes back.
Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's belated war of roses: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are at odds in front of the public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan said: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that has been very painful.”
It was not until after the divorce that she learned of the extent of the fraud.
The impetus for this mental strip was Ryan's PR work for her new film, "The Women," which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: "It's crazy," the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, "Meg repeatedly chews up the history of our relationship and edits it."
Moreover, it is “regrettable” that Jack, their 16-year-old son, is once again “publicly reminiscent of the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become a father to twins.
He concludes his reflections on cheating: “My life goes on anyway.
I feel lucky to have an amazing family that is doing great.”
Ticket prices and hotels are falling.
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one recent study, flights were as much as 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and hotel accommodations have once again become cheaper - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and after a rise in prices in the first quarter, it found a significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than the previous year.
The American Express said the weak exchange rate of the dollar was the cause of the “decreasing appetite of American tourists to travel.”
The decline in hotel prices has also affected financial centres more than industrial ones, such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In Norway, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent to a European record.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while fuel-intensive long-haul flights increased by as much as 29.2 percent.
From April to June, ticket prices in the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the Business and First-Class classes, the changes were less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11.9 percent, down 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, prices fell by half, according to the study.
One of the reasons for this price decline is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable routes by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV is at the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is no longer able to assemble a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge Failed landing for representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach joined the game only late and failed with a shot on the stick.
His message was carefully worded and came out of his mouth convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger hissed in the hallway to the Hamburg Arena cabins.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break between halves was over and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for HSV for almost three decades and enjoys more respect than many of the moment actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol said yes and raised his thumb as a sign of agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jolo.
His order was probably the same: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"It wasn't looking pretty today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wished it more relaxed".
The Hamburgers owe 1:0 (1:0) to the head of Mladen Petric (11th) and the circumstance that the very weak Gladbachers could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty win," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV celebrates 121 years of existence this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a live updated table on the video wall in which their team was listed as the winner.
It's gonna be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the continuous scoreboard symbolises the uncalculation of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petrič and FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly located, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
After the defeat in the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
Early reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to drop by as much as 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in one day in its history.
Later, the Dow regained some weight.
Around 8.30 p.m., the world’s most important stock exchange barometer showed a 5% decline to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down 1,548 points with more than seven percent.
The worst was at the Dow at this point, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
None of the titles were able to strengthen.
Goldman Sachs has lost almost 10% of its shares.
Only a few days ago, large investor Warren Buffett had a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state should receive the stock warrants of financial companies, which, if the exchange rate develops favorably, could be reimbursed, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Equity rates in Europe are falling sharply
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not relieve investors of their doubts.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly down and withdraws the Dax index with it.
The Dow Jones index is losing despite a government bailout.
Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank’s spectacular exchange-rate losses have plunged the German stock index (Dax) deep into negative territory.
The Munich-based real estate financier lost up to three-quarters of its value despite rescue action by the federal government and private banks, while Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark and scored 5,839 points with a minus of 3.7 percent.
Stock markets around the world have come to their knees.
In New York, the Wall Street business day began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion bailout may not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, in the first hour of trading, at 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is due to vote on the bailout plan, with the Senate likely to vote on Oct. 1.
Other European stock exchanges also went in one direction: in London, the FTSE index first declined by 3.2 percent, while the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent after initial gains to 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng Index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and trading ended at 12,595.75.
In MDAX, Arcandor shares lost following the announcement of the increase in registered capital.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed 23 million new shares.
The company also announced that it would not sell its stake in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during a so-called swing-by maneuver (gravity slingshot).
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Fuel lines, which are about to freeze, are now threatening to kill her in the cold.
Among scientists for years, one mysterious phenomenon causes confusion - the anomalies of the gravitational slingshot.
A gravity slingshot is an aerial maneuver by space probes in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of some cosmic body, such as the Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens spacecraft used this physics trick, as did the Ulysses spacecraft.
But what the scientist has been saying for years in this case in amazement: flying bodies do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes unexpectedly accelerate or decelerate.
Until now, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was christened a gravitational slingshot anomaly.
Several experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was right, and is trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational sling using so-called dark matter, whose presence in space has been detected by astronomers.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, and it could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space explorers for about ten years.
It is a gravitational force whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, just visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, a good fifth of the total mass of the universe is of this dark matter.
Egypt's Kidnapped Tourists Are Free
After 10 days in the hands of their captors, according to a statement from the Italian Foreign Minister, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free again.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
In the pre-release shootout, six hijackers are said to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
The Germans are repeatedly targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists brought to the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab television station Al-Arabiya and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from Italian TV station Sky TG 24, "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
According to an Egyptian state television report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are apparently already on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shootout before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the hijackers were ready to end the kidnapping even before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the hijackers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," said the quoted worker.
He said it was "just about taking the hostage" when "this surprise" suddenly came.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday shot dead six hijackers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and captured two of them.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", citing one of the German intermediaries, said that the release of the hostages is being delayed because the kidnappers are afraid for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfathers 'leads to suicide'
Several years of abuse by stepfathers led a woman to kill herself, she was heard in court.
After pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual harassment, the 57-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison.
The Truro Crown Court heard that he had regularly tied up his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
In court, it was also said that Miss Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
While living in Coventry as a child, Trerise bound her and blindfolded her, and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was said in court that Ms. Randle, who had spent much of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was haunted by the specter of abuse being perpetrated on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in court that in 2006, friends of Ms. Randle, who was also very dedicated to surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and that she "gave her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
She is believed to have suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle came face to face with his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words, "I bound her and blindfolded her.
“I didn’t abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been awful for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more horrifying is the fact that if she had not done so, the matter would probably not have reached the court at all."
"I would particularly like to highlight the consequences, according to Stephanie's parents, that your crime has had on their daughter over the years."
"Evidently, otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful, and happy young woman."
An officer who has lost data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on the train to Waterloo while he was temporarily assigned to the Department of Defense.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the least serious offense against the law, and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the Office of the Government," he said.
An employee who cannot be named is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, which is a clause that deals with information protection.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police indict the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he had forgotten contained secret analyses of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Credit unions face B&B debt
British credit unions may have to settle on more than 80 million pounds of debt after bailing out Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be repaid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 credit unions.
The CEO of the Credit Union Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it was "humiliating" that credit unions and their members had to pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be repaid by bailing out Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest accrued in the meantime will be paid annually by all 700 financial firms that take out client deposits.
The Fund's Cash Service Compensation Plan for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 credit unions are included in this figure.
It is humbling that these institutions, which have behaved judiciously... now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions which were not nearly as judicious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each firm was to pay in proportion to the deposits it held and that the pawnshops were to pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the debt will rise to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the pawnshops will have to find 81 million pounds to pay off the interest on the first year.
Adrian Coles, the CEO of the trade association of credit unions, told the BBC that he believes this is not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved judiciously during the boom of the housing market now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were not nearly as judicious."
According to the BSA, no pawnshop has fallen since they appeared in 1945.
“We’re going to have to explore all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what the options are for protecting credit unions and their members from an account that could be substantial,” Cole added.
Interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the whole year, and that could be almost twice as much.
Since credit unions are shareholder-free, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk costs 5 pence per liter
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre starting Monday.
This is the second increase in prices this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves if they want to reflect the price increase in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladeshi ex-premier rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid to be released on bail, meaning she could be arrested if she returns home.
Her lawyers said the court had refused to release her on bail in connection with the accusation that she had obtained over fifty million taka ($729,700) from a certain businessman when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges brought against her.
Khalida Ziya, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, demanded that the local army-held government first give her complete freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was released on parole in order to undergo a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear under the terms of her release whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal against the High Court order to the Supreme Court.
"The High Court has rejected the request of Sheikh Hasina for bail, saying he does not need bail when he is already undergoing investigations abroad released on affidavit," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will appeal against the High Court's order."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to return to the country from abroad in preparation for the December election.
A senior official of the People's League said Sheikh Hasina should return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the military-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khalida Ziya both deny all allegations against each other.
Fears about polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in the recent mass polio vaccination because of Taliban-related violence.
The United Nations conducted vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she says she was unable to reach children in southern parts of Helmand and Kandahar for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said that despite Taliban pledges not to attack or obstruct thousands of vaccine workers.
BSkyB loses ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost a lawsuit over a review of the Competition Commission's decision ordering the firm to reduce its stake in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17,9 % to 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB’s shareholding hindered competition and gave the company a disproportionate influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that as a result prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that BSkyB's acquisition of a stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin consortium chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer organizations and regulator Ofcom were all opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its stake in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - primarily because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to relinquish its voting rights.
New investigation into American lawyers' affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came in a situation where a report on the affair prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislator and former Justice Minister Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said: "Serious allegations, including potential criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice removed nine U.S. attorneys from their positions in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the attorneys had been fired due to poor performance.
However, it later emerged that the fired attorneys were no worse rated than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the layoffs were politically motivated.
Some of the attorneys have been involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others have refused to investigate allegations of voter deception made against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are investigating and pursuing lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the redundancies and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The inspector general's report was very critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying that he bore "primary responsibility" for the layoffs, that he "abdicated" from his leadership position and "remarkably did not get involved" in the events.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will attend the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold award, said he was "honored" by the recognition he received.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nominations are led by Coldplay, which has been shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of Q Magazine, said, "There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed great vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and peaked at number 15.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell has been in the charts for about nine years and has sold more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, in 2003 he was also operated on due to irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways, and other roads, some famous, others only utilitarian.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they’ve never heard of it.
This tiny alley is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - without making it to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic route.
There are no signs with street names.
In a normal atlas, it is virtually invisible.
However, the street has admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-pave the Extra Place and create a cleaner gateway to the shops and boutiques that are to be opened in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were charmed by the shortened aisle simply because it was one of the last remnants from before the block was ennobled.
However, the municipal Office for the Protection and Development of Buildings, which has the street in its power, has no interest in adhering to it.
At a meeting of the land committee of the municipal community, representatives of the municipal authority and the company Avalon Bay outlined a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of Municipal Community 3, the committee favors the option of keeping the street in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be filed next month.
"The city already owns very little land, and we would like to keep Extra Place in its possession," she said.
"There could be proposals for repair and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to re-pave the small street and install seats, several of which would use a cafe, whose developer expects to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main intention is to repair this derelict alleyway and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for the Preservation of Buildings, said the city indeed wanted to sell the street, noting that his office's job was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn’s large farm was divided among several of his children, and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
The Extra Place was led by the back door of CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, and the aisle is perhaps best known as the background photo on the Ramones' album cover of "Rocket to Russia".
"That place was amazing," says Danny Fields, the Ramones manager who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the refinement of the East Village, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, however meagre, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: a bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), posted part of the Extra Place story from the Let's Talk About the City column, which appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even by day and bordered by rusted iron warehouse doors and hammered windows where a week-old newspaper runs through the gutter."
With a few exceptions, the street of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat ran across the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, which now houses an expensive clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers lay an empty beer bottle.
A few passers-by said they rarely think about Extra Place, but suggested he could use a boost.
In contrast, Fields said he thinks some people underestimate the impact of the aisle in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places dark, damp and loathsome."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English
In this issue of Focused on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss candidates' attitudes toward bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a California academic and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, co-authored the book "Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools".
Effectively reaching out to Hispanic voters is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama’s educational agenda proves it.
The Obama campaign notes that "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat such performance gaps, Obama’s education agenda advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for those who are still learning English.
But the question remains whether Barack Obama’s commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes using languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance gaps.
Take Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in Los Angeles East.
The majority of the students at this school are Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Even so, a whopping one hundred percent of fourth-grade students reached the highest level in state math tests in 2008.
Almost as amazing ninety-three percent of fourth graders got to the highest level in state tests of English language and literature.
This incredible achievement has been achieved by a method other than the one Obama favors.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities, and access without excuses.
Further, and this Obama should note, is, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's pedagogical approach for those just learning English, "complete immersion."
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had tremendous success with one completely new pupil from Mexico - after twelve months you would walk into a classroom and not know which one it was."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for what other schools with large proportions of Hispanic and English-taught students should look like?
The results achieved by the school should be taken for granted in answering this question, but the educational agenda of his own party (the National Education Association is a long-time proponent of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make prediction of Obama’s answer unclear.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance differences, he should think carefully about educational patterns that work, rather than mocking them and trivializing them.
Oil falls sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid fears that the U.S. plan to rescue financial markets might not revive the economy.
Oil futures prices fell 7 percent in early morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange to $99.80 a barrel.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial turmoil on Wall Street and also by a pair of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, whereupon they jumped again on the wave of huge uncertainty in financial markets.
The anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the U.S. Congressional leadership announced it had reached an agreement over the weekend on the largest bailout plan in history.
This report has been overshadowed by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the advancing disintegration, the government announced that Citigroup would buy a banking arm of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend negotiations that led to the plan to save the economy "show up to be unable to revive the mood in the market".
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlook for global stock markets, interest rates and exchange rates has been highly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread around the world and especially to China."
Analysts at the bank cut their expectations for next year as oil consumption fell due to slower economic growth, cutting their 2009 gasoline price forecasts by about 20%.
The wild ride in the second quarter broke the team's record
After spending more time in the Jets than anyone else over the past eight seasons, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen it all.
He then followed the development of the second quarter on Sunday, in which the Jets turned a scoreless game into a spanking ride.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched each other in a bleak game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Coles on a 12-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly foreshadowing an afternoon in which their gradually developing collaboration moved miles ahead.
Favre sent Coles in that quarter behind two more touchdowns, including the one in which cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before half-match.
"It was nothing special," Favre told Coles of all his passes.
"He's a damn good player.
We were very good at communicating, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were tossing, the defense attacked Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked a twenty-yard goal from the field, thus gaining a 34-0 lead.
That's the most the Jets have ever won in a quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "Second quarter, or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter with no answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
Many points were scored in a short period of time."
Retired Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever, having broken his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasantly flat track in a time of 2:03:59, he topped by 27 seconds his previous time of 2:04:26, which he ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is really incredibly wide - he broke the world record or at least is the world champion at all distances from a metric mile to a marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing because he was afraid - perhaps too scared in retrospect - that air pollution would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a lightning fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
With runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focusing on longer runs, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes over the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters he had calf cramps two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the break was more of a wake-up call than a hold-up.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little bit in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for allegedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding world marathon tops, relying on drivers as if it were a race on the track, and setting world records above a sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's huge running qualities.
Maintained at a pace by four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached the half by a time of 1:02:04.
After the drivers dropped out, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles before the finish, Gebreselassie took his last run and escaped Kwambai, who then finished in second place in 2:05:36, improving his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in a time of 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, finished the excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon in 2:24:14 time last spring.
She missed the Beijing Games due to what has been described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon she ever ran, she improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan female runners escape to a big lead and then she made it after about 18 1/2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
Proudness and Obstacles to Black Life in a Separate City
Hidden among the sprawling amusement parks of Greater Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and pretentiousness of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet courses, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of guavas, two schools, and no jail."
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Festival to pay their respects to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains sidelined, though she made it a stop for tourists by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers Project from the Depression.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year in which the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for open discussion about race, many residents remain wary of alien views.
“We pay a lot of attention to how our story is told,” says Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city’s oldest parish.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and exertion.
It is both a historical model of black ascension and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also an oak tree-shadowed example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes lauded - that arose out of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the locals are both proud and protective.
And the worry about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way Hurston is called here.
She introduced the world to her hometown through heartfelt books full of dialects such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of a Florida tourist guide turned the city a short way into Route 17, which leads through the often ephemeral center of Florida, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With a big drum in life and in literature, Hurston took the reader to the store of the first Eatonville mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"The left side of the road," she wrote, "is a white brown-trimmed modern national school with well-kept yards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even if he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned widow Dash's new husband, writing that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything at all that fits into an hour-long hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston has linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
This was clearly not the typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the choruses Johnson's girls made immortal by quoting men singing dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered as a chipper eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time, when she rushed into the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud of dignified dress today.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many sneered.
"People have always loved seeing Zora," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging in a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely christened, "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Eatonville, along with the rest of the world, seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major funeral ceremonies or major public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood its significance to the world or its legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's "Wrapped in Rainbows," published in 2003.
Change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-lane main road.
The sprawl of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing struggle brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At the time, a bunch of white guys, they came in and threw oranges and stuff at people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
“Actually, there was a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration and stated of his decision in the Brown case against the Chamber of Education that it was "insulting rather than glorifying to my race."
Residents now argue that desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of its youth.
"Black children were used to hugs - I remember that - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You don't hug your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped make room for many other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors, and artists who, like her, rose above prejudice with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker reached the unmarked grave of Hurston and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a eulogized biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway came on shelves in bookstores, re-enrolling her into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter had found the ramp lights again.
Hurston's former neighbors now considered her a savior.
To show what can happen with its highway to destroy, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to celebrate.
After several years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"The five currents of the highway have resurrected, you would say, directly detonated, real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply: "The dawn saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the city's image.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the re-asphalted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes act as a backwater alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Ninety percent are black.)
Strangers who come in search of the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most conversations must be given in advance, and certain things - like the murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by whites and depicting blacks in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a courageous, self-assured teacher who likes deep red, still fear that their isolated community will not be understood properly.
And even as the Hurston Festival has grown, so has the domestic pride.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and all that, but no better, no worse, and just as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish, and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, resounds a heartfelt love for the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or police force, which he says would use some help.
And even younger ones, such as the 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, when they just pass through here, think, ‘Hm, this town is nothing compared to the others,’” Alondra Kenon said recently after church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we're all fluent in finance.
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If tourists in Manhattan had stayed away from newsstands and huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t have realized they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in the glass beehive of offices above their heads, every day the bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York have the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still rattling metal carts along the sidewalks, transporting muffin pans to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics still move between the towers and wear, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts that hang from the braces on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at street food stalls, and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on a weekday.
It didn’t look like a crisis at all, until I decided, with all my pessimism, to open a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had timed this assignment to coincide with the late afternoon siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people waiting in line.
Not in front of checkout windows to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of a counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's convenience store, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason I did.
However, they have already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places they have come from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They have withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a bit like building savings banks), money unions, and those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state and which claim to treat their customers like family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly gone bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and when New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, tried to hunt down a rescue buyer.
The employees of the offices and shops who stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse were moving their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and that does most of the saving on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned to be fluent in finance over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the bankrupt bank, and her emaciated chief executive, Dick Fuld, with the familiarity of gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed, roughly 50-year-old housekeeper of my apartment building, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my grocery delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing rupture
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party are taking part in a demonstration that presented the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that depict mosques crossed by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend, in which far-right parties made huge gains in the general election.
More than 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were badly damaged sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The culprits spray-painted Jewish symbols on some of the graves, such as the Star of David, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to disguise extremists’ motives of hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration coming as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan nears its end.
Meanwhile, Austria enters the soul-searching round after a swing to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The two far-right parties, which together garnered more than 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, led a vehemently anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were denounced by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party, which received over 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, and even voiced his opposition to foods that are perceived to have a relationship with Islam.
In a recent meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right in the position of the country's strongest political bloc, suggest that this change was mainly caused by young voters worrying about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star convicted of child sexual abuse, was banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed the six-month ban on Glitter after it informed monitoring authorities that it planned to travel through France to Spain.
The travel ban was approved by the Kent police last Thursday after they handed over evidence of Glitter's past convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the court service said, "On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, Kent police asked for an order that would prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, has informed authorities that he wishes to travel abroad, as recorded in the sex offender register.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also give the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he fails to do so, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent Police have announced that they will not be discussing individual cases of Glitter's possible trips around the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, "The Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it’s easier to track someone who stays in the UK because we have extensive systems that handle potential danger more effectively.
Protecting Kent residents is a top priority for the Kent Police and we are working hard to monitor the behavior of recorded sex offenders to minimise any risk to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not let him pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London, while at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order requiring him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK for four months for possessing child pornography.
A source from the Home Office said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, is calm and glad that Glitter has been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I take pictures of the master outside the scene."
No heels, no frills, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, detached from the focus on interpretation - just so I can achieve a relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the other - a man.
Inseparable, aside from privacy, in those moments far from the audience, one can then see an intimate gesture, the depth of a glimpse, or the passionate gesture of hands that are carefree because they are not about to step onto the stage.
The German G?nther Bauer alternates in the "Flamenco-people" theatricality of the performance with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer assembles a unique iconography of flamenco from various backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the Flamenco Photography Month (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca) program, "reflects the ever-increasing international importance of flamenco", the author says, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "can be any kind of people, but if you look at the photographs, you will find that these are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and completely captivate the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 of portraying flamenco singers, guitarists, and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
Applying different stylistic means is contrary to the classic basis of the film and lends it a contemporary spirit, an idea that Bauer himself reflects even flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which does not cease to surprise and develop."
What draws the audience away is not the action of the dance, the singing or the play itself, but the personality and the character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we encounter the most essential, the spirit that manifests itself in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is a constant of work presented during these days in the El Fotómata Gallery.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists is shaped by well-known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of an anthology of flamenco and will soon receive a book edition containing exhibited portraits.
Two years ago, Bauer’s passion for portraiture led to the idea of repeating the idea at the “SportARTproject”.
Although their concept from "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "to photograph people, to get to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a moment, whether longer or just short - that's my passion.
I think in photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or clashes with people, personalities that he sometimes does not even know, or they give him just a few minutes for a photo shoot.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of contemporary flamenco portraits called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery in de la Mata 20, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he is writing is "audacity"
Set in an environment he doesn’t yet know, Mario Vargas Llosa tells of events unknown to him, yet he’s working on a novel that stars Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who’s lived in the Congo for 20 years and traveled to the Amazon.
The perennial favorite of the Nobel Prize in Literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project he is currently employing "is audacious", and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
“If I had any sense, I wouldn’t do it, but I will, and I hope to finish it one day,” he concluded at an exchange of ideas, ideas and words festival that saw around 100 writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in the city over the course of four days.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo theater to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had a devoted audience before him, whose hour of time passed like water - Peruvian with amazing accuracy and a good dose of humor remembered how he "was inspired" by the original "incredible adventure" and "the power to live more than I have lived" by his writings, and how his "lack of inspiration" gave rise to a literary mission; how he substitutes "the lack of inspiration"
The Hispanic-American novelist admitted that "there is no way to know if and to what extent books can change lives," but "I refuse to believe that literature is a mere entertainment, an ephemeral experience" - emphasized Vargas Llosa, saying that he "acts on people" and "forces them to try to get out of line", and urged the writer to "not give in to frivolity" and his own calling.
Because of climatology, the festival in Pozoblanca is missing spears
The performance with the lances, which concludes the ceremony in Pozoblanco, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the performers that the surface of the square was not in good condition was confirmed.
Therefore, the company, together with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavorable meteorological conditions have plagued this celebration for a long time, two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, rain made it impossible for the second scheduled bullfights to take place.
During this time, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to face the bulls in the arena at Castilblanco.
It was only celebrated on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically high performance was carried on his shoulders.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two spear wounds for greetings and one ear, which was brought to him by uncovered seats in the arena rather than by toreador art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the bull arena Los Llanos salty non-greasy.
In the second round of hard work without a single breath, he received sharp criticism from the majority of the audience.
They drove away in a van in Álava with 2,000 kilograms of hashish
Ten minutes to five.
Ertzaintza road check in the municipal district of Armicón (Álava).
Members stop two people driving in a van and they get away.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Interior Department of the Basque government, members of the group pursued them and arrested one of the people driving the van, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A. A. J.
He was charged with drug trafficking and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out a roadside check on N-1 at the points where it crosses the border of the municipal district of Armicón.
They were about to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, sped up sharply and drove away.
Members immediately began to chase the car until the vehicle stopped at the side of the road a few kilometers away, at which point both passengers jumped up and fled into the forest.
Ertzaintza eventually caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were carrying, as revealed during a search of the Iveco Daily brand van.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with packages of hashish, which were subsequently transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "wrinkled" and did not match the information in the documents of the van, so the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
Detained by A. A. J., 28, he was transferred to the police department to handle the appropriate formalities before proceeding to further investigation later.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, favorite Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to leave a parking lot in Montecito, a California road patrol spokesman told People magazine.
The witness said Locklear was "striking on the gas, moving forwards and backwards under loud noises, trying to get out of the parking space - she had run over her sunglasses several times while reversing."
The witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear shortly after stopping on a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the emergency services because she was "fearful for Locklear's life".
When a police patrol arrived at the scene, they found an actress inside the vehicle who had partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented" and therefore the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo a test.
A police spokeswoman said the actress cooperated and that excessive alcohol was immediately ruled out, "yet we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was obvious to officers at first glance."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges Andalusian IU association to exercise its powers in Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the IU’s chief executive and United Left MP, said the final decision on the case of former Seville youth and sports councillor Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of acting on behalf of his family, would depend on the party’s regional association.
"I'm too much of a federalist for that, it's up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares hinted at the actions the party will have to take in relation to the former member of Seville's city council.
However, the IU chief insisted that "transparency" was absolutely necessary in the case of Silva's investigation of illegal conduct: "the IU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"May Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), an epic bet by Garcia
Inspired by episodes from Benito Pérez Galdós’s national past, José Luis Garcia brings to life the famous Spanish uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography, with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "render the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society" that he had always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, along with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during the presentation of the film in front of an extensive team of performers.
May blood will be released in cinemas this Friday and in the future there will be more than four hours of TV series Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of Galdós's literary work, José Luis Garcia claims to have fulfilled his "childhood dream" by making this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to make a film for the Autonomous Province of Madrid on the bicentenary of Madrid's May 2nd anniversary.
The $15 million budget, which was entirely contributed by the province of Madrid, represents a "unique opportunity" for Garcia to create an environment with sets and costumes matching the image of "a shattering Spain that was mistaken for a leader to fight for - the struggle for independence led to the decline and backwardness of the country under Ferdinand VII," he said.
However, the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support he received for Ala Triste or Goya’s Ghosts - almost double the Blood of May - so he could not make some scenes from the script signed by Horace Valcárcel, with whom he has worked almost all his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empezar) works as usual - on stage with actors with whom he usually rehearses and does not choose casting, because he finds it "demeaning" and also believes that "part of the profession of the director is, among other things, to go to theaters and cinemas and thus learn what is happening in the craft".
Many of the actors he chose for May’s Blood have appeared before his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larracaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three female candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, May Blood itself, Seven Tables of French Billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflowers, represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claim that "the latter is yet to appear".
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first, you think you’re working for what’s next, but then you realize you’re working just for the money, so you give in to making one more movie,” Garci explains with a more than 30-year directorial career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer pays tribute to another dancer in Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the father of a Catalan (Floren - Tórtola Ferrer) and mother of an Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and when she was three years old they moved with her family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a passionate life, pioneering women's emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the removal of a corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe enchanted Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we're not about telling her life, we're about grabbing her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of flamenco rhythms.
So the "butterfly dance" evoked me guajira or the "snake dance" some sort of thong.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance also fits this aesthetic," she says.
The show counts on the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel Dove, who will sing Isabel in the same performance as in "Open Doors" (La puerta abierta), and dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to collaborate with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents an older Tórtola, a mature figure.
I am delighted that she has accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honour for me."
The show also includes music and guitars by Jesús Torres and Paca Arriaga, singing by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the drums by El Pájar, the viola by Rafa El Viola, and the collaboration of actor Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of an eternal guide of this kind of artist, who is always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who played her time in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at one time or another, but today no one knows her and even less appreciates her work,” Bayón said.
The show starts today at 8.30pm at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "The Diary of a Newly Married" concludes the Triennial
The launch of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of the Freshly Married" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the site where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the aim of celebrating their 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize.
The "Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennial" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House, and a traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Ray of the Sun", which opened in May this year, and after the New York City Congress is scheduled to move to the various Andalusian provinces, according to plans
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Diary of the Freshly Married", edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis, to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of Andalusia's most worldly poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like each other that much anymore.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "Without Intention" and under the weight of the knowledge that Newman had left, revealing his dismal vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be gravely ill.
But he was a man for everyone.
"Sometimes what a person feels can't be expressed in any way, and I've now lost a great friend," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country have been better because of him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of film and homeland has died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, a time when American self-esteem is at its lowest point, when reasons for pride are desperately being sought.
When times are tough and people without virtues and only a handful of those worth admiring - there's no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from the anti-drug addiction foundation founded in honor of the firstborn son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of home-made food and organic food.
A complete treasure trove for a country that has taken much effort to break free from a suicidal eating culture.
A tumultuous wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was without exaggeration the highlight of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
“The fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us,” notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman did these days - he prides himself on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes not even possible.
But luckily, they are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and has since been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was loyal to, though he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger if I have a filet at home?" he joked.
Let him be proud in heaven that there is harmony between his daughters and his admirers - this is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a self-sacrificing philanthropist".
The Imperfect Race of Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after a failed 2012 it will be perhaps 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we follow yesterday's race, I'll say no!
It was talked about as a perfect race, and in my judgment he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a load of nonsense that right away, if it came to the evaluation and I was an examiner, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one by one.
Nonsense begins with picking up the race number, because of which one has to leave earlier.
That doesn’t seem bad to me, but when one goes there, let them give it everything (including the chip to avoid overfilling the track).
Oh, no.
Here one had to first pick up the number (the first nonsense, go there only because of that) and (after standing the appropriate queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt size S (the second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only small T-shirts, because they are less fabric and cheaper?
All right, that's a small thing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go very early for the chip and the queue took over 15 minutes, he had to give up his backpack.
Over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is something incomprehensible at a race where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven’t put our backpacks away yet, and when we did, it was much worse with the pick-up.
In addition, the waiting time was extended by 40 minutes by rain, which led to a general riot and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow, and some of us, like me, will not see the right time in evaluating the results because of the chip they gave me, which, I suppose, did not record my start time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn’t come to mind.
And so I think we will have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At a conference on new technologies at MIT, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in a new AI-like image recognition and human interaction system - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as summoning a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move around the company's campus) and perceiving what they hear in an interview.
With a camera and a face recognition system, this “receptionist” can find out how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they’re wearing - and listen to and understand the keywords of their conversations.
They can also sort people by conversational groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that he does not belong to the group that speaks to him, and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is going to see someone and tells her that he will be with her in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
Fascinating.
Of course, this is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the bare necessities, without the burden of commercial uselessness, they'd be five times more powerful -- man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as thunder, considering that Microsoft's version since the version adds new features to Windows and more "extra".
A change of direction would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its relevance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who leaned towards the theory that this was Google's first step towards competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's true.
It will never go away, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more to the browser.
The computer turns on to launch Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around windows.
What is the purpose of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here is a small example.
I took this photo in one of the restrooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a poster on the beverage machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, a delay in the release of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count on 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to market together.
The phone is becoming more and more of a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one shone in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "Godfather", and in addition, it is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to get into the list of his life roles, we can delve into the image of a typical muscular man with a pointed moustache who lifts weights in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it is nothing more than a typical cotton men's tank top, close-fitting and sleeveless.
English speakers call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels stands out above all others.
First of all, because of its clumsy name - although popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to sports, because, as the legend tells, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other high-quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost imperceptible) Belgian flag, which models of the most emblematic vests have as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not only specialize in tank tops.
They also produce college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, baby clothes, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, I don't care who the father is."
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, although small in stature, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new role in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than just lending her name to some pretty, famous girl.
In Paris, she participated in a promotion organized by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as in the announcement of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
She's hearty and shy, and she'll win you over.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection that Penélope and I designed for Mango this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second annual "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
It was a difficult, but also an exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango, for which you are working already for the fourth season?
My sister and I love films from the 1950s and 1960s, and we have drawn a lot of inspiration from them.
I also love wandering around the city and watching women walk around dressed, combining and layering their clothes, I do this very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I used to like clothes, I always wanted to go to my grandmother’s house, go to my aunt’s closet and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going to the fair.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the way I dressed.
You know, we dancers take pride in how we are conditioned to feel good about our lessons and rehearsals when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you really penetrate the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 the other day, hit by a crisis?
Nope.
I'm feeling better than I've ever felt before. I'm having fun in my 30s.
I find that the woman is already finished, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I do what I want to do, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don’t want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the film, there are several premieres of the films you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to seeing them in cinemas.
I come from the theater world, so I am very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, and of course I can’t.
I am looking forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the catwalk next to Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm gonna go stand on the pier as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to take part in a fundraiser for her organization, Women for a Better Life, and the clothes we were showing - I also selected two models from our Mango collection - were auctioned off and the proceeds were handed over to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi's heart is that good.
There are many things said about her, and I, knowing her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good stuff he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a handstand, I'll do it, too.
I will do whatever is necessary for the benefit of the women of the Third World.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will need to install an "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for drunk driving must install a system in his car that prevents him from starting the car when drunk or if he does not breathe.
The proposal became known in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
His goal is to return the driver behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take a course in traffic re-education.
In addition to the National Traffic Safety Authority, the General Directorate of Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technological Institute for Automotive Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of drivers charged more than once for drunk driving get behind the wheel again in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this from happening as it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe first or if a higher than permitted concentration of alcohol is detected.
Its price exceeds 1000 euros and it would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that offences against vehicles fitted with this device decreased by 65% during the first year of introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it leads to a crime.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, since the legislation can be implemented in the usual way, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial and public service vehicles have already been tested.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Workers’ Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
At 5.40 p.m., a Spanish Air Force plane landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in México D.F., carrying the Prince and Princess of Asturias.
The sun had just set, but its rays had still forced the blinding of the hand to allow the subsequent pair to emerge from the plane.
Under the steps stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, that's not gonna get you to pick up people at the airport... she's from here or something...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right...
However, the Mexican press knows well who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how significant their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport next to the red carpet and military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorable volley.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue-colored suit, and the princess, very sparingly dressed and with loose hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that there is a threat of thunderstorm in D. F.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and pose for them casually.
At the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, a chatty Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
The best subsidized fashion price
There is probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris, and there is probably no more exquisite designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable international presentation of new talents in the fashion industry.
The price is subsidized by EUR 300,000.
Belgian first-year winner Sandrina Fasoli viewed her designs yesterday in the Manga window on Paris’s 54th Avenue Haussmann, almost crying with emotion.
Sure, it is the second largest store of this company in Europe and has just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for taking over the chair of the competition jury, caused us to end up having a sumptuous dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
Mango’s festively decorated chair looked even more amazing next to Chagall’s finest works.
Heartbroken by her brother’s recent death, Nati put on the brand’s clothes and breathless ELAH jewelry and hung her son, Luis, a nearly two-meter-tall elegán, at the head of the table for dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took up the welcome and, like a true gentleman, remained with Baron Rothschild without his jacket, having both offered it to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - hand-designed - trousers and a shirt, and dressed in a long black sexy dress for dinner, was moved by a night walk through the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us the hall for ballet rehearsals, and while remembering other times, she grabbed one of the bars and hinted at a "grand plie".
Inés Sastre did not stay to see the palace buildings next door, but she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone before leaving.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who came to the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no fragrances be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Parisian sky.
Oh l'l', c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And to make matters worse, they are all summarized in one book, which will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the hurried rhythm that contemporary life brings.
The office is called Tension and Computer Back Pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
However, there are no one or two methods to fight everyday exhaustion and break away from the world of work.
No, that number is no larger and no smaller than 1001.
Outside of yoga positions, classic massages and “spa” therapy, Susannah Marriott has collected a whole “menu” of options, tailored to each individual’s tastes and time possibilities.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 way to relax" and thanks to the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK it will bring peace to the bookshop.
If one considers that it is impossible to achieve calm in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other ways to be in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off the lights, and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may startle you, but it's actually meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilocvia.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure many of you have heard that he was talking in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with a high fever), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is not one single reason that explains its rise.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nightmares, enuresis nocturna or sleepwalking, but it may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often accompany very high fevers, stressful or exacerbated situations.
In any case, this is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great force, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem that causes him great anxiety, and in this way he manifests himself.
We have said that it is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventative measures, such as:
Try not to upset the baby too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who can relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the baby to sleep more peacefully.
When the somnilocius appears, try to keep calm.
Remind yourself that it is harmless to the child and that he will not remember anything from what happened the next day.
Helpful Hints
Don't wake him.
It is useless because he is not conscious and you interrupt his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and therefore rests.
Keep in mind that if your child seems to be very troubled several times in a row, it might be a good idea to seek advice or find out what is causing your child such anxiety.
If he understands what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and extract information from him.
It won't do any good, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious, so he can arrange his thoughts.
In addition, you may hear what he says, but you don’t know what he is dreaming about, and therefore why, so be very careful about how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even for fun.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
Don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s just an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long, thin period.
Without playing a particularly big match, the yellow-blacks created more chances and were able to transform one of them victoriously.
The game did not have too fast a pace during this match, in which the attackers were difficult to enforce.
After the first attempt of the captain hosts Kauffmann, who missed the line from a distance, Illhaeusern began to have a slight advantage and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain on a long leg or Diebold gradually came to irritate the defense of Dannemarie.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the pitch and left only agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to Dannemarie's two chances with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after the opening of the score for Illhaeusern, taken care of by Marais, well positioned to handle the ball bounced after Diebold's previous attempt (53').
However, the Illhaeuserna goalie did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room, leaving his teammates weakened.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to make the most of it, and the eleven from Illhaeusern, who had only retreated a little to "concentrate" the defense, caused no more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the crossbar after much confusion.
Sarkozy to face angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy takes a detour through Brittany.
Faced with a demonstration of the strength of fishermen who heavily disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French president decided to head to the Guilvinec port in Finistere on Tuesday morning to meet with their leaders there.
The latter have promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit" and hope "to come up with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to obtain measures against a sharp increase in diesel prices, which reached a peak above an average of 1.14 euros per liter.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the Elysee Palace, said the president “will discuss with them the solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure conditions for the employment and disbursement of seafarers.”
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they performed a "snail" operation (slow-moving vehicles operation) in the Morbihan and Calvados departments, causing nearly 10km of constipation.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections in the direction of Belle-Ele were not interrupted.
A filter dam was put into operation on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors demonstrated their determination as early as Monday, when tyres and pallets were burning at dawn in front of fuel depots in Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the canal of la Manche, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the traffic of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area halted the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before deciding to act.
In Guilvinec on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on how to continue the journey and its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the state fishing department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not abandon anything" and "they do not want to come to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairwoman of the Lorient fishing department.
Professional fishermen who do not pay tax on diesel currently pay about 50 cents per liter, but they consider that the threshold of profitability of the ship is reached only when diesel is below 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes all bowed to the film's legend and politically engaged actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer retains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on the supply of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession hovering over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains its 2008 supply assumptions with 215 instruments delivered, its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer has a lot of promise from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 instruments to Chinese clients over an eight-year period.
AIG is reportedly looking to divest 15% of its assets
The American International Group, an insurer that has been afloat by US money authorities, is considering ceding more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion it has been given as a down payment, the Financial Times reports Sunday.
AIG is poised to examine the sale of most of its non-life insurance business internationally and retirement activities in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to the FT, the board of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine the possible referral.
No confirmatory statements could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its aviation leasing arm International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurance hedger Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision on these referrals has yet been taken, France Télécom continues.
AIG must urgently raise cash in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve, at the risk of being seized by U.S. authorities of 80% of its capital, thereby diluting it to an appropriate ratio of current shareholders.
Paris. Analysis of the historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange saw a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to bail out banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
He recorded the biggest point drop in his history (by 684.81 points) on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trading after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index, with the predominant technology component, lost 199.61 points after closing and settled at 1,983.73, and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Depressed from the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street literally collapsed after an unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan by the House of Representatives, a plan that was supposed to make it possible to find a little bit of stability in the markets again.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to provide Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent out by the market, which sees that Congress is not able to adopt a certain plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market has relied on this plan," she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late."
“If this project is truly doomed, the relay will be handed over to the Fed and other central banks without delay to avert a crisis that would further strengthen credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, senior economist at Global Insight.
In the United States, Piegza said, “every new day brings the downfall of a financial institution.”
Following the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of the banking activities of Wachovia Bank by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn, prompting urgent intervention in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are facing "not just the US crisis, but the world crisis," said FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The yield on the cash order fell to 3,632% for 10 years, from 3,827% on Friday evening, while the yield on 30 years fell to 4,161% from 4,357% the day before.
Obama wins his first TV duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House was followed by a second debate to see which of the pair, John McCain and Barack Obama, had won.
The Republican and Democratic campaign commanders were not surprised when they both declared their victory in a television duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, the decline in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters who matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of those polled, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday through the supposed good performance of his running mate Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's talented," Bill Clinton said this weekend.
McCain, in his 70s, consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while at the same time stressing his opponent's "naivety" on issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." was the repeated accusation.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
It has been in such an offensive spirit since yesterday's Republican TV commercials.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represents the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to take the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't get it, while Obama does," a Democratic ad said over the weekend, accusing the Republican of not taking enough account of the crisis' impact on the "ordinary American."
“In the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing to say about you,” Obama told 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina for an election.
Neither did he utter words like "middle class" or "working." Financial disintegration clearly favors Obama, whom Americans consider more capable of saving the economy on the brink.
"A decisive reversal could take place next week," Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democrat candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as run by George Bush and as supported by Senator McCain".
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite Wall Street's unexpected jumps, he should be able to cut taxes on 95% of Americans, and also warned that implementing the country's eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have carefully avoided questions about the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial aid plan adopted by Congress last night, which is highly unpopular.
"Did you notice there was an election in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of parliamentary elections.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of polling stations in Minsk's main square to protest the irregularity of the elections to the parliament.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, resignation".
Some admit they didn’t even go to the polls: “What good would it do if they did whatever they wanted with my vote anyway,” says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
The sanctions, which include a visa ban on 40 Belarusian officials and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if the election is considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count," said Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse grouping of 12 parties.
“This is a cosmetic change,” points out Alexandr Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, “because the important thing is who is counting the votes, and in our country it is the executive power.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by being appointed, not elected.
Their entry into parliament, however, can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to take part in the political operation because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitored the elections, will not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that turnout seems to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way to all sorts of manipulations.
"What about you, have you noticed that there were some elections?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was not a single foot in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones who suit the regime the most."
The silence of the night once again took hold of the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Interview - Blood That's Sure Again
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, rightly rejoiced as Héma-Québec became one of the most reliable and efficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained public trust, which was seriously shaken after the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is widely known, the state blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Due to this drama and a wave of public outcry, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such a calamity not be repeated.
While Judge Krever delayed handing in the report, some provinces set in motion a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee stood up for this role.
After Gélineau and Krever's report, two contractors were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to manage Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society for supplying all provinces and both territories.
“When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, only 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system,” recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was disheartening.
Through continuous efforts to increase the safety of blood products and continuous work in this area over the following years, we have regained the trust of the public," he says, proudly adding that by the beginning of 2008 Héma-Québek was trusted by almost 94% of the Quebec population.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that “trust is something very fragile.”
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
“At the time, we saw many cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,” says the woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread through the blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever-Gélineau report, according to which, when we do not know it and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, we need to take measures to eliminate it.
Thus, in April 1999, we rejected blood from people who had resided in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Several years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that sticking to the precautionary principle made sense."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV emerged on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) to detect the presence of the virus itself in donor blood, rather than the presence of antibodies on which the tests were based.
NAT tests have reduced the deaf period between the time a patient is infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without their knowledge and without our being able to figure it out.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone becomes infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through a blood product to occur.
I believe that today we can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion in complete peace of mind for healing," said Héma-Québek, the head of the Héma-Québek leadership.
“The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what disease-causing element may appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by insect bites.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that, in addition to the safe supply, Héma-Québec must also count on sufficient supply.
"Needs are growing as the population ages.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of eligible Quebecers."
Every healthy person at least 18 years of age, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people offering blood are not accepted because they carry AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have visited a country where mud fevers are raging, they are expelled for one year.
"With this 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be replenished as they age and are no longer able to donate blood.
But persuading people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life today is so unbridled that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at Hema-Québek, which also administers the only public cord blood bank in Québek.
The umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, abounds in blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th cord blood sample into the bank, and we expect to collect over 1,000 a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
“Some moms are disappointed that they don’t have access to it,” because Héma-Québec doesn’t have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all Québec hospitals.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
At Saputo Stadium yesterday, Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division knockout round during the second and decisive quarter-final match, thanks to a 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) win over the Seattle Sounders.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the deciding goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a two-sided goalless first half, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino netted the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to deal with Matt Jordan on behalf of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday during the first of the two matches quarterfinals suffered Impact at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle, a 2:1 defeat.
Impact will play the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder tied the home game deficit 3:1 and eventually won 4:3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless advanced to the semi-final round with a total of 5:4 goals.
The Whitecaps are due to face the Impact on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will not be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
Canadien's first offensive trio is ready to start the season.
A squad consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekanec and Andrej Kosticin last night at Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists and Kovalev reaped one pass in this fourth win of the three-color of the six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the win by scoring a single goal during separate raids.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian said.
“I need one more game to feel good.
“He tried to do too much in the first period,” Guy Carbonneau said.
“I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a good applause.”
Charest bet to the north
Prime Minister says he won't call an early election by the end of the year
Right after the end of the Liberal Party (Parti libéral) congress, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's by-elections.
"To push back the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually engaging way at the end of the Quebec Liberal Party congress in Lévis, but without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind his back in a sort of picture grinder.
On the three giant canvases ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, mines, Québek from the perspective of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous resources, as in the pre-election period.
At a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out calling an early election in the autumn, although he pointed out that he has a very busy schedule.
The “Northern Plan” forms the fourth dimension of the “vision” the prime minister intends for Quebec, a vision of a “new economic space” that includes a labor agreement with France, a Canada-Europe agreement, and agreements with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, so far it has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "jewel with enormous potential", but did not give a deadline, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further developed: hydropower, forest, but especially the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
The north, according to Charest's enumeration, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice the size of France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And it is not only with us, but it is within us," he said, as if to show that he was invoking a certain national founding myth.
Québec was built largely in relation to the North, the Prime Minister pointed out: the pursuit of gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after paused theatrically to look at the huge map behind his back.
The north, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes the part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister said during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all previous governments.
“There is one boundary line that has long been non-existent, and if the opportunity arises, I will take that position again in the name of the government,” he said.
Otherwise, "it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change," he said, speaking about the north-west transition, which will open year-round as a result of melting glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuits?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
The work was initiated by the Interministerial Committee chaired by Benoit Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision is set".
Moreover, the development of the North should be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North’s plan will be “jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a fluid follow-up to the vision of liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the ever-shattering themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a big cocktail celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s leadership of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes rechristening Beauharnois' headquarters to the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who carried out the Peaceful Revolution and the nationalization of hydropower, to Bourassa, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future,” said Jean Charest.
In a press conference, he invoked another authority, conservatively this time, namely John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, premiered between 1957 and 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric power plant, Charest stressed that its launch is planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he told his member base, sparking a lot of applause.
The same prime minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering an election in the autumn of this year, which is allowed by law.
However, he stressed that his program is busy, especially the missions of the federal council in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend's congress provided the Liberal leader with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "efforts to amend the constitution" that went very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) calls in particular for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Québec to name a portion of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council who would have veto power in the case of decisions taken in Québek.
From the side of the opposition, Plan North was in its main features accepted skeptically.
PQ (Parti Québecois) chief Pauline Marois once again pulled out the North Quebec Development Policy that Landry's government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, she renounced this policy.
If she had stuck to it, “we would have kept going today,” Marois noted alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Francoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of Plan North in the government.
"We wish, however, that this was not a mere spectacle," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - The Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, ex-minister of "justice" (o irony) in Harper's cabinet, who took the liberty of saying of Louise Arbour last summer that she represented a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor a woman who has waged an unrelenting fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that is the only one among all the Western countries involved that has not brought back to its homeland its own citizen locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t take into account that Omar Khadr was a young adolescent at the time when the actions that were being blamed on him were supposed to have taken place.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and especially the Association of Canadian Lawyers are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can expect a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that this young man is psychologically destroyed henceforth, and undoubtedly permanently, after so many years of torment.
We don’t realize it, but we are witnessing a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our “democracy,” words that Harper so craves and that sound so empty out of his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, mistreat him, imprison him at the will of the leader of the hitherto minority government (as will be the case after October 14...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in the party that preaches Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, on this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In a September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world’s largest gold producer has launched prosecutions of three authors and a poor little publishing house for libel in order to spark a “transparent public debate” and demands six million from them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they judge not truthfulness, especially in the case of prosecution for libel, but law.
Unsurprisingly, Garver is completely oblivious to this crucial distinction.
Or is the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate, to bankrupt anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be ready to defend themselves and fight a very unbalanced battle with an army of lawyers backed by the almost bottomless pockets of a mining company.
Incidentally, tactics in these unsettled battles often consist of ruining the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that plugs the mouth of the opposing party and, moreover, frightens anyone who would dare to pursue the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view of the matter to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate normally lies in the exchange of ideas, not the truncheons.
So mining companies have had to open up their books, their documentation, and establish a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and the funding of independent science teams that could shed light on the matter.
Barrick Gold, however, does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and promptly rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate" and at the same time despise the views of the same public?
In the Vice President’s world, this word seems to refer only to high-paid lawyers, and not to all Canadians; that is a rather narrow concept of the term.
In a democracy, even libelers have the right to speak out.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - that the public that supports Noir Canada's authors and publishers does so primarily because they reject the brutal ways of the mining company.
The public is ready to hear and judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant is to be shut up (as part of its prosecution of the "public debate," Barrick, by the way, has just made an official appeal to the authors of Noir Canada to officially notify them to stop using the term...).
Aside from Garver’s surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university’s freedom of inquiry and truth-seeking, which is fundamental to any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss topics that the world’s rich don’t like without subjecting ourselves to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have formed one if it followed the scientific standards used by Noir Canada authors.
He has a right to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated lawsuit makes it clear that, despite what it claims, it has not the slightest desire to have a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as it is for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to limit this type of unjustified prosecution.
Operation to Save Wall Street: Democrats and Republicans
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the Wall Street financial crisis has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it foresees: better control of the elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms ensuring the repayment of deposited public money, new measures to capture the amount of houses seized for non-payment, as well as the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to executives of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Representative of the Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after the conclusion of a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great strides in reaching an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a Bush administration official.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis that is taking place on Wall Street," he said.
"This is a crucial point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos, and disruption to Americans' everyday lives will be enormous," Rep. Judd Gregg said.
Over the past few hours, negotiations have taken a turn for fear of the effect another failure would have on investor sentiment.
The deadline was to open the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the U.S. presidency were invited to negotiate later, and both expressed their preference for the agreement, without neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such a last resort.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added some measures to the deal, especially one designed to allow homeowners to retain their residence, as well as wage measures for state-saved labor leaders.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is no point in congratulating ourselves.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the waves of television.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was polled by another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, responded, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The coarse features I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which it will be possible to move forward.
To choose inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to buy up dubious claims and risky and unsaleable assets of US financial institutions with taxpayer money.
The plan comes after 14 months of a crisis unleashed by the bursting of the housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages, then shifted to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAAs), and resulted in a cash freeze and the disintegration of banks and financial institutions.
The collapse of the first draft deal last week was caused by Republican MPs.
Ever since the Democrats agreed that some of the “toxic” assets of companies in difficulty would only be guaranteed by the government, but would not be bought, it is believed that the impasse has been averted.
In an effort to reconcile opposing views in Congress, a measure was added stipulating that the government would be able to introduce new fees to help her get her deposit back if, as a result of the program, she would have to take losses for five years.
The new plan envisages a first deposit of $250 billion, to which another $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
A further $350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the rescued companies, which will pay him dividends if he makes a profit, and which it will be able to resell when it’s all over.
The federal government will be able to delay the procedures for the seizure of real estate related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as set limits on the amount of remuneration and compensation paid to executives of the affected companies.
The plan's proponents would like to put it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have a green light.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against the project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
"It's pretty obvious that Washington can't hear you," said Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee.
“We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, making money from taxpayers is not the solution.”
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the "Skeptics Committee," presents the matter differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us asking Congress not to rush too far and to look carefully at which path to take,” he said.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
Following the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for ?11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
Intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since losing 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) due to the crisis of risky loans to buy real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is among Europe’s top 20 banks and top 10 insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that is what savers and households can appreciate in these uncertain times.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government appears to have begun nationalising another bank hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from the bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) were loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, Santander will buy the branches and client accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalised by the UK government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a socially engaged icon
His beauty with cyan eyes long represented his trump, according to others weakness.
Did this American actor with a charming smile break out of narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensibility, and undying talent that he possessed also distanced him from the power category that begets real stars.
What a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died Friday at his Connecticut ranch at the age of 83 as a result of lung cancer, and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less grandiose than Brando, whom he resembled and had long been his rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful babies.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother a Hungarian.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
No exaggeration of the ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw this whole country falling in love with self-made mana, a fighter in the Pacific War, wounded in battle, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s, then attended New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theater, television, and early in film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a race car driver who placed second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1979, and a sexual symbol, despite the fact that he had been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, too, go the shady spots of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the fuss of his own show-business, which will forever remain mysterious to some extent.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's passing this weekend has caused vertigo for movie lovers, while his big roles compete on the black screen of memories.
After him, more than half a century of the ever-changing American seventh art.
A charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) resurfaces in memory, a young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in A Cat on a Hot Roof, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From a less distant past (1990) we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled at an advanced age by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, the tortured, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role reprised for James Dean after his death, which she made known to Newman in 1956.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, the Oscar for Best Picture of 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen’s amazing The Hustler (1961), he will play the same character in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money, bringing him a single Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face wandering through the ages, it was he.
And him again.
In his professional career, different eras compete with each other.
The young know him mainly thanks to the cult Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
The fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudson's Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
He then ended his career playing the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike a few film legends who left the industry relatively early, Newman remained in the business for a long time, although he denounced Hollywood with its glamour, pomp, and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "a living challenge of underplaying", judging that he pushed too hard in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came on a platter, the profession was not always so tender.
The first lovers, however, he played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, rascals, and despondents, whose declension and rebellion were reflected in his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known aspects of his shy sensibility.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, he dedicated the film Harry and Son to his son Scott, whom he lost due to an overdose.
In a flurry of tributes to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) lamented, "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of life, these are the main characteristics of a deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, he also leaves behind a great campaigner for civil rights, ecology, independent film, and an opponent of Hollywood’s decline.
We used to see his likeness on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which may have seemed rather tasteless to us, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to his Foundation for Difficult Childhood.
So Newman, rather than let himself be lulled by the glory, was engaged in society until the last moment.
He left a note with these words to his five daughters: "Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us, it was an honor to pursue the career of such a visionary and generous American artist.
After all, he is a model citizen.
What was produced at the Zuschlag & spol. invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial will begin in criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates.
The politician and his associates are accused, among other crimes, including forgery of documents, of fraud committed in the long term and systematically by a criminal organization, as a result of which extremely significant damage was caused.
According to the prosecutor's office, they used the money raised in public tenders for their own purposes and often documented the fulfillment of tasks with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and self-government - totalling approximately 65 million forints - went partly to the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method also reported by the investigating authority was that the money raised in the tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration and never met the accepted commitments of the association.
According to the indictment, a large proportion of the invoices were fake.
The forms for these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, the round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The decision on the names of the companies to produce invoices was made, among other things, on a round trip along the northern shore of Lake Balaton, to which István Lados was sent by János Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, the first one had to look for pensions and restaurants.
In them, he applied for bills for his consumption, the model of which was then produced invoices submitted as part of public competitions announced by, among others, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and the Municipality of the capital.
István Lados and his partner András ?ri, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies, exhibited the invoices.
During his "study trip", Lados visited one of the cellars.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, the restaurant catered for the 90-member Biztos Pont group.
However, according to the head of the company, so many people would not fit into this device at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 was full of formal and factual errors to a foundation called Jobb J?v?ért, later Egy?tt and Harmadik Évezredért.
The guest house in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, no more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet one hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
Fillers of forms with a rich imagination, however, overstated it even when they listed on the documents a company dedicated to the hospitality industry - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounting according to the information provided to the Public Prosecutor's Office documents sounding in the name of Jobb J?v?ért and Hoppá did not even figure.
Mr Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and shown invoices, he immediately knew they were fake documents.
"Our business name and our tax number were stamped in the wrong place."
In addition to the formalities, he said, they did not agree to accommodate 100 people because they only had 11 rooms that did not have such a large capacity.
In addition, food was also indicated on the invoice, and their restaurant has not worked for a long time.
Zealous invoice producers were also not convinced that the Budapest travel agency they were looking for only organizes foreign trips, and they foolishly listed the invoice with cash payment, which also did not coincide with the company’s invoicing practice, as a travel mediation service in Hungary.
In addition, as the investigation revealed, VAT was also included in the document, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
In the four documents issued to Jobb J?v?ért by Hotel Révf?l?p s.r.o., the company’s activities were not covered by the 25 % but by the 15 % VAT, in addition to which the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, but the invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the "publishers" spoiled the invoice by stating that one company, as it turned out thanks to an investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office, was engaged in the transport of goods by road, which the company originally based on investment advice did not carry out.
Moreover, the fact that the invoices issued to the Egy?tt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and the XXI Századi Kulturális Egyes?let and Biztos Pont associations are false has also been revealed due to formal deviations - not in accordance with the invoice format and the wrong stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, their representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the forgers did not notice that the company HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal Városért association was eating there, which is why, according to our information, the company’s liquidation commissioner also denied that he would issue the paper.
Invoices were consciously
The second group of invoicers are those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for about four million forints to the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták organization.
According to the indictment, the head of Collab s. r. o. was forced to issue a fictitious account by one of the accused Ludovic Gy?rfi.
Biogate s. r. o. also cooperated with Zuschlage and its partners, currently in liquidation, which supplied Jobb J?v?ért and Atlasz and V?r?sfeny with invoices worth around five million forints in 2003, which did not involve any real economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the created invoices were later canceled, which, however, organizations have already forgotten to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing firms includes those that had ties to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Ivan Kubatov was an authorised representative of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió s. r. o., a company dealing in fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not to be found.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data established by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s. r. o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The managing director of the company was a man from Romania, to whom Ivan Kubatov was supposed to hand over documents concerning the company in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppa and the Egyott and Harmadik Évezredért foundations, and accepted their consideration himself.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s. were founded by Romanian masons.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies were of benefit to him, since at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to Atlasz and Y-Generáció linked to Zuschlag.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor's office concluded that Kubatov had come to 10 percent of the amounts stated on the invoices and VAT.
The man also used Szi-Beri k. t. to issue fictitious invoices, this time for a tender for Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szevetség and Modern Magyarországért associations submitted proposals for the public tender of the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They received 500 thousand forints each, but did not spend the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
To make matters worse, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
After all, these invoices were found during a house search in the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, a part of the defendants will probably describe the progress of the production of invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor’s office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything himself.
His testimony to date is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to explain everything at length, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the socialists made a deal with him and Zusi will take the blame.
He may have been offended, because his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, namely to be placed under house arrest, have been ignored to date.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have done much greater harm than they have paid, are free to walk or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology of trumping: why do we spend more money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed to researchers in the fields of neurology and economics at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to fall behind in eBay auctions, so they would rather pay too high a price.
The research used an experimental auction to try to map the pattern of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in a live auction, where active brain regions were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method.
In both games, participants could win money, but when playing at an auction, an important element of which is to trump the other side, the whole located under the cerebral cortex, called striatum, began to work intensively while losing.
This brain area, among many other functions, plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the unscrewing of the price can be explained by an effort to avoid a sharp striatum reaction.
To support their theory, members of the research team from the ranks of economists conducted a financial cross-sectional survey.
There were three groups bidding against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the other group were promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but lost the money in the event of a loss.
So the difference between the two groups was that one was highlighted as a win and the other as a loss.
However, the anti-loser group were willing to go higher than the control and the “winner” group, confirming the neurologist’s hypothesis.
"These results cannot be deduced from any pre-existing economic theory.
Until now, they have explained the phenomena observable in the auctions of the joys of victory and avoidance of risk.
Neurological imaging methods have helped us resolve the discrepancy between the two theories, and now we have a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is the leading cause of death.
The number of home cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 of them are treated. The reason for this is that the sick often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a collective term for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, which are characterized by inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the causative agents of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Depending on the causative agent of the disease, hepatitis A and E spread through the digestive tract (for example, infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood and body fluids viruses (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva).
In any case, travelers should protect themselves by vaccinating against the A and B viruses, there is no vaccine against the C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, nausea.
After that, jaundice forms on the skin and whites of the eyes, pale stools and darkens urine. Treatment can last as long as two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die from the more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected patients is treated with medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most people don’t even know about their disease, the causative agent of the disease destroys liver cells insidiously, and so the first symptoms occur in many cases in 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention is very important, the implementation of regular screening.
In three groups, the disease occurs much more often than average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated number of people worldwide infected with chronic hepatitis C is 200 million.
Since the disease can already be proven by routine laboratory tests, a person should contact his or her general practitioner if he or she notices any symptoms of unknown origin.
With early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body to prevent infection and prevent the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized by organizations representing the sick worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God doesn’t hurt so much?
According to recent research, belief in God works as a kind of analgesic that could have eased the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examining how the belief in a god affects the perception of pain in a person, reports the British newspaper Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and an equal number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that examines the human brain in detail, it has also been shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first in a series of studies involving scholars, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The test was carried out precisely by attaching a sparking tool to the left hand of the test subject, which gave off electric shocks.
The researchers asked participants to observe two paintings: Sassoferrata’s 17th-century Virgin Mary and Leonardo da Vinci’s 15th-century lady with an ingret.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would evoke a certain state of piety in the faithful, while Da Vinci’s image was chosen because it was not very different from the first and it gave them a calming impression.
Subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive portions, while separately viewing the image with a religious or general theme.
Catholics said they felt “safe” when they saw the Virgin Mary, as if they had been “taken care of” and “calmed down, filled with peace.”
When viewing a religious painting, they said they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strongly impressive image even in atheists, just need to find the right photo.
"We would have to find an image that they would perceive very positively, from the position of mother or father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing faith should and in many cases will change our personality,” Wright said.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the regulation of the pain of believers if they were shown a Madonna by Leonardo or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would looking at a quality Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You are what you share.
On their tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they have been on vacation, what specialist examinations they go to, and what interests them.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, that's still not enough.
However, when it comes to skeptics who parallel Orwellian dark visions, the very nature of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for Google’s founders to stick to their original intent: “Let’s organize all the information in the world!”
According to a Google representative, even after ten years of world-class work, the company is only at the beginning of working with all the information.
When asked what would be five years from now, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would be right for me?" -- but software won't be able to answer those seemingly simple questions until they know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that during Internet searches, search words are accurately captured, as well as from which IP address they were searched and to which pages the searchers moved after searching.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can, for example, save their browsing history, look back at what they were looking for and clicked on, which in the long term generates findings tailored to them - the same logic will be based on Recommendations, through which the system will offer products and services based on the previously mentioned and retained preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I do? - ask users who are afraid of looking at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is rather threatening; the counter-reaction does not cause Internet users to feel guilty, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or even revolt against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but can also be issued to a third party in justified cases, in such legal cases, the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
Perhaps the best-known example of this was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community pages set up through it.
But Internet users worried about personal rights could take a breather in May, when the company, in conjunction with the EFF, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced by any article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully scrambled nearly 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, which it obtained in reference to a strengthening of the child protection law passed years ago, yet it failed to get lists of individual users’ search items, or complete lists of web pages and keywords, covering a period of two months.)
The view of Google is so contradictory: it is being flogged by those who are afraid of providing their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be harmed by using Google services, and they oppose it with the revolt that belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, America’s geek culture and its wild offshoot, rallying around enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees it as a new generation of big business, a “corporation that’s now booming,” unlike its rival Microsoft, which is seen as a world conqueror because of Windows, though both are fighting for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want them to pay for their applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information, and a package of programs seems much more accessible, more youthful, "cooler" than the practice of an official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personal rights, which brought with it one of the most common keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, about deliberately leaving our footprints behind and using the communication channels we have, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can keep a profile on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which they can easily connect with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app that records their music, all of which they can then connect to navigation systems, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, as well as write a blog on which their latest photo galleries will automatically appear.
We can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which it emerges: a girlfriend in the morning, looking at a flood of photos of her mutual friends, easily figures out who her sly friend spent the evening with, or the company can fire her employee just because she describes her honest opinion about the top management in her blog: one thing is for sure, the concept of private life has been completely reconsidered today.
One who lives an online life consists of what he shows of himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least avoid the Google monopoly, has the option (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google’s search system, however, deliberately leaves no trace).
For example, a significant number of people don’t register on community sites to avoid being found. Google’s online applications, from text editor to photo editor and news portal, can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and that do not build the best possible profile from us.
Public opinion is not secretly waiting for Google to show its teeth.
At $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space is threatening ad agency investments, and services being introduced at an accelerating pace are seriously disrupting the lives of Microsoft and many other software designers.
However, critical observers also find counterpoints giving an unsettling impression: the top management, for example, has completely rejected employees’ protests after raising the fee for the company’s kindergarten to twice as high, while the company’s management says that the casual daily meals of employees were too expensive, all this is lost in addition to the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and, in the sense of their agreement, filtered out any finding that is contrary to the good Chinese regime, or good taste.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services until they can be used, but it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years can shake the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking on such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of its Health system, in which we can find our own health.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can serve as a good starting point for future generations of science fiction writers, Cory Doctorow’s famous novel “Scroogled” describes with Orwellian reminiscences a future in which one can be frighteningly close to a person only with the help of Google data.
Two juveniles helped remove traces of double 'Zd' killer
Two juveniles were interviewed by police in the case of the double murder in 'zd, according to a well-founded suspicion they helped remove traces of this crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County High Police Directorate said on Tuesday.
Persons have confessed to the activity for which they were suspected and are currently being charged with aiding and abetting a crime.
Both minors, according to MTI two girls, are being prosecuted at large.
Aiding a crime is punishable by up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect in the double murder in 'zd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of committing multiple premeditated homicides for self-serving reasons.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed the 53-year-old a large sum of money.
The suspect did not want to pay back his debt, so he lured his creditor to an establishment in 'zd last Wednesday, where he killed first the man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the youth was preparing for the commission of the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100 percent stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is because the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to the bidder for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, and Deutsche Boerse have so far submitted bids.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25%, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In Tuesday's commentary on the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers are already recalling "the second 9/11".
We can thank the US president for the global financial disaster, Rome’s La Repubblica accuses. The president has not even been able to rally his own party in support of that hastily-paid bill, which aims to remedy this dire situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the culprit in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the country’s lack of political leadership has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of a collapse of the US financial system is growing steadily, and the entire world will eventually pay the price.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, following a vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to resolve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Until now, individual states can throw a lifeline at staggering financial institutions, and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy.
But if other banks collapse like dominoes, then neither money nor other improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, EU Member States need to move beyond their national egotism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, fractious monetary institutions received more than 100 billion euros, according to Vienna’s Der Standard, according to which fears that, like Americans, European taxpayers will have to dig deep to resolve the crisis are becoming more real.
Until now, the European Union has not seriously addressed the crisis that is sweeping through the old continent like a tsunami.
"Rescuers" do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good if they firmly established in which case it is reasonable to take taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of a bumblebee
What would be the best method to develop technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitation detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
For example, with bees.
The initial strategic idea of the surprise project, presented at the CEATEC trade fair in Japan, was inspired by Nissan engineers to build a new generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has engineered a biomimetic BR23C robotic control system, a robotic minicar that is equipped with bee features, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
“During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which actually closely resembles our safety protective packaging,” said Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of Technology PR and R&D.
Compound eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eye, engineers went for the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters ahead of BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into a collision avoidance operation.
The obstacle is captured in a fraction of a second, then the robotized car begins to imitate the movements of the bee and by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent a collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this pull-out manoeuvre takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If this were not the case, the robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and inmost layer of the safety protective package, within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect what the bee is doing to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered by bees during avoidance, only the possibility of rotational movement, acceleration and deceleration was applied in the case of a robotic car.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, an instinctive, intelligent response is important, not the ability to process, much less store data.
This mechanism only needs to process and respond to a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need for it to store and react using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it constantly uses only memory of a few kilobytes in size.
It does not need memory with giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step in the development of an immediate avoidance technology that Nissan predicts could enter production vehicles within a decade.
Another option may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the specified final destination after avoiding obstacles in the way.
My precious child has a name.
The $700 billion bailout bill, which is to be split into several instalments and aims to buy back low-quality bank loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further talks, which ended just after midnight on Saturday, Congressional officials reached an agreement in a few days of debate over a $700 billion bailout package.
"We have made significant progress," Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, said in a statement.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, also supported the compromise on the package.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said of the compromise's outcome: "The program will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (that is, Monday at 2 a.m. Central European Time), but it did not cause any particular rise in the stock market.
The bill, which will be called the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, will be voted on by the House of Representatives on Monday, followed by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, after which news of the deal was also welcomed at the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made at night and greatly appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
After all, the program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend $700 billion on low-quality mortgage-backed securities all at once.
It is now possible to spend up to half of $700 billion in the first round by using $250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to decide the matter on Monday, with the Treasury buying mortgage-backed securities that are rated as low-quality, with the fate of the remaining $100 billion depending on the president’s decision.
The program will be overseen by a special committee of which the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank will also be a member.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next Congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy out low-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other "poisonous" loans.
Purchases can take place within the auctions and directly, the competent representatives of the Ministry said.
The law will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee for funds representing a cause for concern, for which the companies will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the bill provides the necessary funds to meet the urgent demands of the U.S. financial system, whether it’s to make large-scale purchases of bad funds, to insure them, or to prevent systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed."
On the contrary, bank bosses who are in trouble and waiting for the help of the state can count on the government to reduce their severance pay - which is simply called a "golden parachute" in overseas slang.
Their payouts will be limited only in certain cases, moreover, these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the Ministry buys in the auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on the gold parachutes, unless the fallen bank directors are sent straight to retirement.
In the case of a direct buyback of low-quality loans, the government will aggressively intervene in order not to exaggerate the money for the leadership.
It is necessary to add that the existing gold-fall contracts will not change, the restriction applies only to new contracts, which is supposed to be an additional incentive to participate in the program.
"This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be statutory restrictions on CEO compensation," said Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state will have the right to acquire a stake in the banks participating in the program, which will reduce the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy, and with it the rescued bank, gets back on its feet, they can also profit from this transaction.
In the next five years, the president will have to submit a bill to Congress setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be repaid to taxpayers.
Of course, there were voices of doubt on both sides.
“This is not what the American people asked us to do, it’s not what will protect taxpayers’ dollars,” said Rep. Darrell Issa, a Republican congressman from California.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, said that those responsible for the Wall Street collapse had urged the legislation.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry rose 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared to 12.9 percent in August 2007, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported.
Export sales prices in the industry were 1.1 percent higher compared to July 2008, down 3.9% year-on-year.
Production prices in industry were 0.7% higher as a cause of domestic and export price changes compared to the previous month, up 3.2% year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased only minimally compared to the previous month, by 0.1 percent.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly, by 0.1 percent, compared to July.
The biggest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8%), mainly due to a month-on-month increase in the production of bag and saddlery products by 4.6% and in the production of footwear by 2.5%.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical materials and products sector (1.6 percent).
Price cuts occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 percent), the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimal extent - in the woodworking sector (0.1 percent).
Prices in the paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other manufacturing industries, we have seen price increases of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water generation and distribution sector, which has a significant impact on domestic sales of the industry, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the continuing increase in gas prices, which has been officially set since July 1.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic sales in individual sectors of the processing industry, prices increased the most in the oil processing sector (32.4%).
In the metalworking industry, there was a 13.2 percent increase in prices for food products, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight.
Prices fell in the textiles and textile products (2.5%) and electrical machinery and equipment (0.3%) sectors.
In other manufacturing industries, the price growth rate was between 0.6% and 9.1%.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing sector increased by 10.2% over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector exceeded those of the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In terms of division by industry focus, the highest monthly price increase (0.7%) in the sectors concerned with the production of tangible assets was reflected in domestic sales in August.
In the consumer goods industries, prices rose by 0.3 percent, in the energy processing and downstream industries, prices did not change compared to the previous month.
The largest increase in prices compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in the energy processing and downstream sectors (16.8%) in August 2008.
In the consumer goods industries, we recorded a price increase of 6.8 percent, while for tangible assets, prices fell by 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of industrial products, measured in forints, rose 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, down 3.9 percent in a 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro in one month, 7.1 percent against the dollar, 7.5 percent against the euro in August 2007, and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Going to the United States without a visa next year?
There is a strong hope that the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into effect around January 12, according to Kinga Goncz, the foreign minister speaking in Chicago before leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "almost everything now depends on whether an electronic system of road permits or inspections will be built overseas in time."
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system will not include a permit to enter, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
As of today, the representative of Hungarian diplomacy continues negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross to the Star of the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary, and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers of Democratic Party presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of a bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major U.S. parties, agreed on Sunday to back a $700 billion government bailout package, but are also politicians demanding the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
After a few days of marathon negotiations between Congress and administration officials, it was announced early Sunday morning: a basic deal on the bank bailout package had been concluded.
The financial package, which aims to reshape the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are better suited to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, as economic issues have come to the fore, Obama has regained some advantage and the McCain lead he secured following the Republican convention by nominating Sarah Palin as vice president.
Obama expressed hope at an election rally in Detroit on Sunday that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection, which he also supports.
“We have to act now, responsibly ... your jobs, your savings, your entire industry, the stability of the whole economy is in danger,” he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
McCain said in an interview with ABC: “It’s going to be a bit of a pain to everyone... but doing nothing is just not an option.”
As stated by the Republican senator, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission supervising the finance minister and the restrictions on severance payments for top officials, which he insisted.
Obama told CBS News that McCain had no major role in the talks, but was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House would vote on the bill on Monday.
Overview of German language printing
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - thus analyzing the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of a left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Fathers".
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have been restoring Bavaria for decades - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The changing of the period is a problem for all Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel.
The debate was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Saturday the process, which could be assumed almost exactly ten years ago, ended: the undisputed hegemony of one state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, a period often referred to as Stoiber’s.
This is due to the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country, which is eating up its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at a pace they have been very wrong. However, secularization, educational results, the settlement of Germans from the east and the north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not have been without consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with an increase in possibilities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more willful.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has been the most distant from the classical civic strata; people in the liberal profession, self-employed, individuals with graduation and with higher education.
Support for CSU has already shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily in its article entitled "Who, with whom? Party presidents are restrained on coalition issues" deals with the confused internal political situation arising as a result of the Austrian elections.
He wants to talk to the VP.
The VP prohibits interference in its internal affairs.
BZ - seems open to all negotiations, the Greens do not yet want to agree on a coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders did not get much insight into their cards.
SP chairman Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the LVP.
And it wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some Länder and in the social partnership there is.
The question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the VP, as vice-chancellor, was left open by Faymann.
As he put it, the Schussel-Molterer course was overruled at any rate.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer responded cautiously to the red bids.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the OVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is so far completely open in the party, these issues need to be discussed decisively within the VP.
The chairman of the BZ-Jorg Haider again appeared open in all directions.
"In order to prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóková: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today in Paris, the European Summit of Equality, hosted by France, the current presiding state of the European Union, began.
Lívia Járóková, a member of the European People's Party on behalf of the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the expert discussion, drew attention to segregation in education in her message to the plenary, which is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The summit was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on behalf of the French Presidency.
Meetings were held among invited representatives of governments, European social partners, Europe’s leading rights organisations and civil society organisations working in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz Group of MEPs, Járóková pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs during the recruitment process, Romani people are pushed out of the European labour market primarily because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Romani people do not have a secondary education, and due to the poor quality of primary education, only a minority of them can reach a higher level of education."
Járók also stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role to play in the implementation of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economies of European Union Member States.
According to the MP, it is necessary to confirm the awareness of these connections in the widest circles - among Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the greater chance he will have of becoming a productive member of the labor market; through income and excise taxes, he contributes to the national budget.
"Roma have the right to their citizenship of the European Union, the need to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the removal of their low-quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MEP, the cohesion of the European Union with an emphasis on the goal and negotiations is needed in order to speed up the desegregation processes of schools immediately, and proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations is of paramount importance.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment; it is necessary to provide Romani children with opportunities given by democratic space so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," she said.
Under the banner of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Summit for Equality, which has been held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum helping to achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set at the level of the whole of Europe and of individual Member States.
CSU: temporary pardon
The fate of the late duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the disgraceful electoral debacle, the debate on personal issues has so far been adjourned by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
Party leader Erwin Huber and country prime minister Guenther Beckstein can still stay in their seats, the question is how long this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17% loss of votes, will be decided last October by an extraordinary party congress.
In any case, members of the highly criticized duo have made it clear that they will not cling to their positions with all their might.
They tried to calm the angry faction and base members, who demanded personal consequences the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" due to the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago - under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was still at the top of his career - the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it was only 43.4 percent.
The CSU had been a “self-governing power” in Bavaria producing 18 percent of Germany’s GDP for 46 years.
Although conservatives continue to hold a high position in the southern state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, they will, in any case, be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of a reorganisation within the party is the fact that a member of the close intelligence team that will begin probing negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or rather with the right-wing Free Voter Group, will be the deputy chairman and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
Ironically, Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to stage a coup, entered the assembly on the candidate list for the Free Voters, but then made a mercilessly short process with an ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has so far been spinning strings from the background, will also play an active role in the transition period, calling 28 September the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some snide remarks about the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a major role in the national success of 2005, somehow gets back on its feet.
According to Merkel, who had a hard time hiding her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU’s positions will not have a negative impact on Berlin’s grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating a wounded CSU will not be easier, and the Social Democrats crisis continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6 percent.
Lukashenko: opposition - 110:0
Not a single opposition member was elected to the Belarusian parliament on Sunday.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the well-being and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by the illegalities that occurred in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10 million-strong country has lacked opposition for well over a decade, the opposition, grouped under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) ahead of yesterday's election, seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had retained a number of opposition seats in parliament following a constitutional amendment in a disputed election in 2006 and for the fourth time, would "allow" several to appear in parliament.
The DOJ has also dropped the previously considered boycott.
Against the background of opposition expectations, Belarus - which took credit to mitigate the impact of Russia's ever-increasing imports of natural gas and also contributed to bringing the transit pipeline company Beltransgaz into Russian hands - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where it is not allowed to do so due to the Belarusian political system being assessed as anti-democratic by Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians.
The release had previously pointed out that the OSCE had placed emphasis on positive shifts in its assessment of the election campaign, and not on shortcomings - such as a ban on candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
However, Monday's OSCE flash report already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not actually appear in the press, especially the fact that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, one can still feel an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in smaller confrontations with Moscow, as it continues to refuse to recognize the breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus is a union state on paper, considers the two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told the newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to keep it that way, even though "the power has been afraid to venture into the insignificant parliament of a single member of the opposition".
Looking at the results, the opposition is not planning protests, but rather trying to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with that, of course, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are putting obstacles in the distribution, but I can see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly," Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not consider the most officially supported layer of pensioners to be correct or even the most supported.
“Due to the country’s indebtedness and the growing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security of the cemetery’s ‘inducing silence’ collapses,” Milinkevich said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States Sergei Lebedev told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words, but actions", so the absence of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of Chigi Palace that revolving doors have been introduced upon the arrival and departure of employees.
But from now on, this new measure will work against smart people, against those who inject themselves and then go out for coffee during working hours.
The news against sloths was launched today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presentations and more services," he said.
“A new era of accountability and transparency will now open up.
This is reformism," Brunetta said.
With the Chigi Palace, we will complete the introduction in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections from the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a joint procedure with the workers and the cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast during business hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning".
During one conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister will eventually announce that within three months the absence of public employees due to the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60,000 more people per year at work".
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"Its pay dynamics - the minister explains - have doubled in the last 8-10 years relative to the private sector and are far higher than the inflation percentage".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees gathered to reject Brunett's decree standards in line with a request backed by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Administration today will present figures regarding lower absenteeism from work due to illness - writes the Consumer Protection Association - the nation of 'difficult idlers' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public servants who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.”
In particular, Taru will be protested against the exclusion of sick pay, which depends on the activity; the extension of the period during which the patient can be checked, in what time period the inspection visits will be carried out, and the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Occupational injuries, Napolitano: "Resolutional prevention"
Every day, 2,500 work-related accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
Inail figures confirm that there are roughly 1,200 deaths from work-related accidents in 2007.
These figures testify to the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and accounts for nearly twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to raise the attention of institutions, social and information media on this dramatic problem, Anmil celebrates today in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Victims of Work-Related Accidents, set for the second Sunday in October.
"The alarming data disseminated by Anmile and the same tragic reports these days confirm the importance of the issue of occupational safety," President Giorgio Napolitano confirms in a message sent to President Anmilu, the National Association for the Mutilated and Disabled, about the work of Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his lively admiration for the constant joint efforts for safety in jobs, for the protection of injured workers, for the assistance of the families of the victims and for the participation of public opinion.
"Naturally, outraged 'enough' has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies that, by their scale, stir up the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality offers us dramatic cases once again, even repeated in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education are of particular importance in order to give young people facing the world of work a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social severity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
Chamber President Gianfranco Fini said: “How the phenomenon of death as a result of an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social state, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to bring about the necessary end to this state of affairs.”
“In terms of data on work-related injuries, they appear to show a positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths from work-related injuries is alarming anyway,” said Anmila President Pietro Mercandelli.
“We wouldn’t want this ‘reduction effort’ to lead to less attention, because just when the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that there is still too little generally done to stop the problem of injuries and there are many activities that can have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the area of training workers, right from school age."
"Further efforts are needed - he added - in terms of communication and public participation.
But what is needed above all is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that constitutes an exceptional social phenomenon.”
Mercandelli eventually stated that this was a progressive degeneration of the levels of right to compensation envisaged for labor victims and the "postponement of supportive care the system has been receiving in recent years."
“The goal is to give back the insurance guarantee to the worker, because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gifting from time to time to the legislator.”
MP3 Players Charged, Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to loud music for extended periods of time and using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a European Commission announcement published today, quoting the opinion of the Committee for the Science of Health Risks, which has recently emerged and has been identified (Csrseri) by the EU, in an official report circulated widely in Brussels.
"From this scientific point of view - we read in the notes - 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music devices for at least five years, more than an hour a day and keep the device at high volume, risk permanent loss of hearing ability."
“It worries me that such a large number of young people who use often portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” admits Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - continues the lead - indicate a clear risk and need to be acted upon quickly.
Most importantly, we need to encourage consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding so that they become fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate this problem, given the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists confirm that there is a need to worry and now the European Commission, together with the other members and the parties that raised the issue, will examine what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from being exposed to noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices."
There is already a safety European standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by overexposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
According to the EU Scientific Committee, users of portable music devices who use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week will exceed the currently applicable limits for maximum permitted workplace noise.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for an extended period of time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices, and their amount can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno let the Commission for the Future of the Capital run free
Today we will start, in March we will close, in June we will have sums.
Such is the calendar given by Campidoglio to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the commission will compile handbooks for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councillor Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas - it wants to emphasize Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by political arbitrators, which remain Giunta e Municipal Council.
It is not an exchange of functions, but only an effort to have a place to work on a large project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then disbanded, as this institution must have a precise deadline.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome".
Whoever accuses the Commission of being useless, given that its views will not be binding, Alemanno will reply: 'Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are good, as the Attali Commission's proposals are, and I am sure they will be in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics splinters over everyday problems and the urgency that comes along from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is neither a useless undertaking nor a bluff: it is completely free, will not cost the citizens of Rome even the euro and will serve to think about and involve the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definitive nor motionless, in order to allow our city an authentic ascension to the level it urgently needs and to think with a united spirit about its future.".
The future, which, the mayor of Rome specifies, "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but also "includes the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. Now we know why
A well-known US president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
One Miami woman wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he will get to the top of a nation that had two governors and five black senators!”
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then we have polls; they all say Obama will win and by a big margin.
Even in this case, there are those who act on the heart, not the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, commented: At least once in the polling booth, we know well to whom an American patriot will give his vote.
There's a side of the American mentality that's stuck right up to the last minute.
Say what you want, we'll take care of it ourselves in the end, who to tick, whether Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
But despite all these considerations, George Bush is the main weapon for the Democrats.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his term? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, the nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent him home with kicks in his ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become a weakness for most of Bush.
Whoever takes Georgia W's place will have to do a huge job.
The economic collapse of the US was also felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of printed matter.
The PEW Research Center asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and their assumptions about the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not say openly that they had less concern about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of the ruined economic model.
Moreover, the cuts made to the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, are a huge problem.
According to the interviewed journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism as understood by the general public to fundamentally change.
American journalists have a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors believe that journalism on a national scale is going the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many view as a "killer" of printed matter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists report has increased by 79%.
The 500 journalists surveyed admitted that they resorted to technology in the hope that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms - that is, the leaders - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value falls to 23%.
This has something to do with "job security."
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs in three years are 47% nationally.
As for journalists, they are at 30%.
As for the "certain work" concerning the staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a nation as vast as the U.S., with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, televisions, and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it’s a question of taking or letting go.
Leaders almost always receive huge salaries, and an editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month in addition to paying their pensions and insurance.
As for leave, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, until it reaches fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confessions, often fall ill within a year.
It is only a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: THE COURT IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATS
The president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the submission of the real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who requested that he be allowed to relocate from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with a counteroffer in the Unipol-Bnl sale.
During the trial, at his own expense, he was released last week from house arrest, which was converted into forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real estate entrepreneur could change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which he expressed pm) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon became apparent a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion rescue plan put forward by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is tearing apart the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, its milder, federal-agency and business-community-friendly, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to “those from Washington” and the world of finance, especially strong in states in the middle and south.
A soul that has arrogantly manifested itself in the vote I was talking about at the beginning..
But this just quoted thing is just an example of the changes, the big changes, that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not just in the United States, but in the whole West, and maybe not just here.
Both in the US and in Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, which are solidifying and finally coming to light in the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is actualization, an extraordinary revival of the market, a double category of State-power in relation to a certain renationalization of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which, above all, the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state, are included to the greatest extent.
Which has also created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be substantially out of the question, or that it has nothing much to add: the obvious evidence has been given by the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different national strategies, and which is unable to choose a single common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: the moment we get into distress, only states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources, to be able to try to put everything in order.
And they also possess the necessary resources and authorizations to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances that perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of to a similar degree.
Indeed, this new emphase, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is in full accord with the growing importance which the latest economic advances attempt to attribute to one factor closely connected with it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of a network, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to rule the world, all of a sudden we realized that our future would have to deal more and more with such little immaterial things as water, grain, oil.
All things, who would say, can be transported from one place on the earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to a limited space, a territory.
So who will become their ruler, certainly has much more cards up his sleeve than who is not, and who has the misfortune to live in a place without grain, without oil, and without water.
I come to the second news, which, however, foresees a turning point.
Those who speak of territory, state, government, inevitably speak of politics, that is, of leadership.
Given the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be emerging.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who can take the situation.
On the other hand, there has been a wave of discrediting of existing leaderships, especially economic ones, which have proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: the discredit, the impatience, the sense of incompetence and absence that is trying to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
Indeed, it seems that convictions are becoming more and more widespread among the broad masses of the population, rather than their actions being the same as the ideas of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply feeds one branch from the underground, but a strong movement for the removal of the ruling classes and the traditional political order is manifested in unexpected electoral “resistances” or unexpected changes in collective moods in recent and recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the fall of the Labour Party in Great Britain, to the revolt of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps what to do with it).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, some would say their format, are having more and more problems to understand, that is, to represent, which, not as of today, is being created in the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is getting stronger again, growing, potentially too loud.
Before this, it would be an exaggeration to speak of a permanent “mass rebellion”.
But we can't say that it means keeping your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the subject of various U.S. research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
The researchers managed to keep the 100-kilogram body glued to the vertical wall using a sticker of just 2.5 square centimeters.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by a team of researchers, is the development of pre-existing materials that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
“The basis of the glue can be thought of as a series of tubes laid as an ordered pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the gecko's feet, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to provide perfect adhesion.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the reptile’s feet and, at the same time, “is simply peeling off the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at Dayton University’s Engineering School.
"This material could be useful as a makeshift adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but researchers are thinking of a far less fascinating use as a coupling of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
No super heroes yet.
NEXT RESEARCH The University of Berkeley, California, is also researching new adhesives.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California scientists introduced microfiber-shaped glue that cleans itself from dust by moving it over a surface to maintain perfect fit.
Medications: never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes the amplification or reduction of potency with serious consequences on health.
For David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, to highlight the risks of both ready-to-eat and fresh juices combined with the ingestion of certain drugs, the ongoing 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia raises a new alarm: one glass of grapefruit, orange, and apple juice is enough to reduce the risk of absorbing some life-saving drugs, nullifying their beneficial effects, and exposing patients to health.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing down to toxic levels the effects of some anti-arithmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines, and neurological drugs.
RISK MEDICINE - The Italian Medical Agency itself reported this in an information bulletin two years ago, prompting doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take drugs, such as Diazepam or Metadone.
Not only does GRAPEFRUIT contain substances that suppress drugs, experts say.
A long list of effects dampened by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Milan State University, said: “Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions on medicines.
So always read the illustrative lists of medicines you get, and if you come across something unclear, do not worry, but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification», stressed the expert for the agency Ansa.
Nobel Prize for Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Kenyan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a noted editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration’s foreign, economic, and political policies.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, on the days of Enron’s collapse, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of its implications for the history of the United States, far more important than the first.
A prediction that caused a lot of controversy and that had been reproached for years, but which turned out to be accurate.
“I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from the public eye,” Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Central European Bank Executive Committee, Krugman is an “economist of great importance” but also a popularizer who has “a very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush liberal administration”.
Open Office, we have here the third release of the package"anti-Microsoft»
It’s Open Office.org Day 3.0, an open source personal production package that’s headed for penetration by more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the better-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year of volunteer work, controlled by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with a variety of news: additional, more substantial ones, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version, will be added to the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window.
The focus is also on working with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as what allows you to reduce the dimensions of your PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for transferring electronically, or the ability to transfer a PDF file to a graphic design model and maintain the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create "PDF hybrids" documents that are similar to typical Adobe graphics and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in excel, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in text program, each co-worker is assigned one color for comments to be more clearly identified in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should rebuild the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it has been added to the English version, which is located on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation cd can be sent home or to the workplace upon request.
And if the topic of free can be a draw for expansion in the home, the Open Office business area is a big bet on the package, and can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are also training offers, consultations and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows working on databases; Draw, after all, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are at almost 3 million and 600,000 today, with the release of the new version, it is possible that this projected number can be overcome.
Kohl's results are also positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and winner of the T-shirt of the best climber.
The report was quoted by the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth Cera-positive racer, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricci and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those made in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analyses confirm Cera's positivity, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the stipulated two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl's positivity at the third-generation Epo is corroborated by Pierre Bordry, the head of France's anti-doping agency, who told the Associated Press that he had already informed Austrian government authorities of the result.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed on the podium behind Carlos Sastre of Spain and Cadel Evansema of America, and he also won the top-notch T-shirt of the best climber.
IMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES WONDER, IS ITALIA A RASIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only in the last house turned into a priority destination of immigrants" received with resistance.
Is this turning a beautiful country into a nation of racists? So they ask in a long New York Times article devoting this article to a debate about racism in Italy, starting with the case of a young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of cookies.
The case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern areas are also where "more integration and more work" is registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support of the Northern League".
To confirm the increasing tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturna.
Not only that.
Also, the new legislation required by the Lega, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
"Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism."
Students are victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not have a crisis.
According to the latest research of Sunia, the unions for tenants, rent a single room can cost a student in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that entire layers of students have lost the right to study due to the overall too high prices that their families would have to endure - explains Sunia's Office of Studies head, Laura Mariani - in this city a large demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has fuelled a process of price increases that has spread to residents as well".
In most cases, lease offers contain several violations: contracts in a free manner, unregistered, without limited rent, associated sublease.
For Sunji, an exceptional intervention is needed, which could regulate prices thanks to a tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros per bed, the single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 (the Bande Nere zone) through a median value of 800 (the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in zones near the university, 250/280 euros is needed per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double.
The figures are slightly lower (550 euro per single) in the zones near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitta).
We will only save if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros per single room in the zones of Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, a bed is 300/450 euros, a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want for a bed 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where rents for students from outside the European Union are the most common, one more anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students, compared to Italian ones.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, cities cancel historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is like a blind man; it is like a face without eyes.”
The painting, offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore, successfully documents what is happening in large Italian urban centers as well as rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multi-halls in the suburbs, and the subsequent demise of mono-halls in the central zones of cities is one of the events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the hallmarks of a true cultural crime.
“It’s like losing a friend, a friend with whom we shared a part of our journey and a lot of emotions,” says director of New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won Tornator an Oscar and a grand jury prize at Cannes 20 years ago, and who told the poetry of a village cinema and sadness over a way of life that the cinema may have lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional tip closed their doors, and the highest bill was paid primarily by the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torino, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna comes first with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multi-halls are the first to be responsible for their disappearance: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 more in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
Paolo Protti, president of Anec, said: “It is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to move into a multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about the lack of subsidy to the fund for the benefit of the operators: the previous national debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a disgrace that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would take between 16 and 18 million euros a year to support the sector.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to worry about closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protokulum between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historic centers and suburbs.
Among the planned standards are the steps of tax breaks in favour of operators and the benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the limited traffic zone and will have special prices to stop and at some parking lots.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
Defending traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to start the "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialto or Quirinal in the street Nazionale, where I have shared so many emotions that I do not have to look at the inscriptions blackened with dust, I turn to the other side.
Connection between politics and mafia group 'ndrangheta, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"Mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust municipal office elections according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group".
The charges brought by the Directorate against the Calabria Mafia against the mayor and vice-mayor Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organisation, are difficult.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson the lawyer, the namesake of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," prosecutors wrote when two local governments expressed their willingness to pay for consultations to Piromalli's attorney.
"This would allow the mafia group to officially enter the city authorities and facilitate the already vast possibilities for control and management of public administration."
The president of the Calabrian Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "there are a lot of secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld in his county: "There are areas in which the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndrangheta, heroes who are still unsullied".
This morning's incarceration follows last July's incarceration, which showed police that the Piromalli mafia group had received the final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was also the supposed connection between organized crime and local administration - local politicians were deprived of office in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who was elected head of the centre-right coalition at the time of the dissolution after a narrower election in May.
He was screaming over the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called then-Deputy Home Secretary Marco Minniti to account, accusing him of orchestrating everything for political reasons, but the judges in the jail order signed this morning explain that the mafia group has even gone so far as to request a change to the A3 motorway project.
Other interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion have revealed "a willingness to shift the claims of a businessman, a representative of some larger group very close as is commonly known, to Piromalli and to adjust the public administration's choices to the interests of the mafia group."
When energy is born from the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an infinite deposit that covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new sources of inexhaustible energy that have caught the eye of colossus like Chevron, who is now trying to lay hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a century, and in the 1970s, in the context of the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away. But now environmental organizations and a new increase in the price of oil gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London stated in 2007 that approximately 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of ocean waves.
That would be twice the amount of energy currently produced in nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are currents and tides.
Giants are attacking.
The company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron studies ocean energy technology - spoke a spokesperson for one company that is linked to the United States oil colossus in the economic daily Wall Street Journal - and they are thinking about the possibility of working with us".
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of a marine energy project in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially when we consider that it is in Alaska that the US continues to produce oil, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are following the trail of marine energy, and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, show increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology that is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
So far, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are of small dimensions and do not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
For greater energy production, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of scares that are interconnected with each other.
The strength of the waves that move up and down with the buoys is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure spins the turbine, which supplies power to the generator.
The energy is coming ashore through submarine cables.
At the moment, there are four such devices in the project phase, which are only waiting for federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power already generates power for its shopping mall and car park by using six submarine turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water during high tide causes the turbines to rotate, which feed the generator.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients waiting for necessary authorizations to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tides, after the tides.
Of particular interest at this point is the potential for tides, say the Institute for Electric Energy Research.
Although it is an incoherent factor, tides are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
Countries like New York, Maine, and Alaska, along with other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
