28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco store
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was the stairwell of a local store this week.
But the victim’s brother says he can’t think of anyone who would want to hurt him, adding, “He’s finally started to do well.”
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco's Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
Victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was previously a regular cook in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
“We have a small team that works as a closely related family. We will miss them very much,” the spokesperson said.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrow belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank had first slept in the dormitories, but that he had recently "finally begun to thrive."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food, he made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in a fight.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an uncut diamond that lit up every day,” he said.

Czech Railways has invested more than 31 billion euros in vehicle modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier has invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years with the exception of 2012 are gradually decreasing.
Over the past six years, Czech Railways has invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was reflected in the reduction of the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic wagons.
A larger share of the investment was made by the carrier in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money went to, and 40 percent was invested in the renewal of vehicles for long-haul transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, upgraded older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not taken into account, the average age of ČD’s powertrains would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger cars are a little older, with an average age of 23 years when modernizing.
If only the age from the date of manufacture is taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
In recent years, however, classic trains made up of wagons and hauled by locomotives have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of locomotives dropped from 280 to 223, while the number of classic wagons dropped from 2,716 in 2011 to 2,132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier disposed of old vehicles equipped with leatherette seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, the carrier scrapped 110 of these cars.
Of the investments that ČD plans to make in the fleet in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic fast trains.
The contract provides for the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The authorities have known about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We are powerless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editors of the online daily Aktuálně.cz have been following the story of a billboard in South Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where there is not only a walk in the trees, but also an Olympic park.
Highway officials know it's black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of such advertisements all over the country.
Officials said a flimsy law meant illegal mobile billboards could not be removed immediately.
First of all, a complicated bureaucratic circle is needed.
In the meantime, the company changes its name and the office is short.
Or just move the ad a few meters and the official process has to start again.
A quarter of a year ago, the Directorate of Roads and Motorways admitted: at the main road from České Budějovice to Lipno, an advertising billboard stands black on our land by the state road.
But even three months were not enough to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one cares that they're standing right next to the road, in a 50-meter protection zone where nothing can happen for safety reasons.
Road administrators say they simply cannot deal with the billboard because of the leaking law.
Maybe load it up and take it away.
“We can’t just afford that,” said Nina Ledvinová, a spokesman for the Road and Motorway Directorate, referring to the complicated bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must precede under the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began to be followed in detail by the online daily Aktuálně.cz in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In South Bohemia alone, the editorial office counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
There are other countries as well.
"We have difficulties to force companies to remove the banners," confirms Jiří Klása, head of the transport department of the regional office in České Budějovice, whose colleagues are addressing similar stories.
According to Klása, a leaky law is to blame, which binds officials.
First, he has to reach out to the billboard owner in order to put the ad away.
However, company bosses are often unrivaled or know the trick that Aktuálně.cz described in the past when it became more interested in the issue: just move the mobile stand with advertising a few meters and officials can throw the previous call for the removal of black advertising in the trash.
That's because the bureau has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new device and we have to address the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law will not help.
The change could be brought by a new law that from September next year will ban billboards on motorways and restrict them on class I roads.
Critics point out that the rules for tackling illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities will not be so relieved.
Companies can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns per year on leases of illegal land and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard attracting to Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the České Budějovice municipality is currently conducting three administrative proceedings for blackboarded billboards.
The company faces a fine of 300,000 euros in each case.
These are more ads that were placed without permission in the protection zone of the 1st class road.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Transport Department at the České Budějovice City Hall.
Advertising, which Aktuálně.cz is interested in, is not yet included among these cases, but will most likely soon be added to them.
According to RSD spokeswoman Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will thus be brought to the table by regional and then probably municipal officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't get in touch.
It does not accept mail and the official seat in Žižkov was cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the post office of the company went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
However, Fischer, whose company, Euro Billboard, leases space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has rejected any connection in the past.
This spring, when ŘSD became interested in advertising for Lipno at the initiative of Aktuálně.cz, Fischer had civil servants send a letter to the mysterious Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the company is reportedly based.
Even from this address, however, no one has contacted the highway administrators to this day.
A futile fight.
Similar silences or opaque changes of residences are not uncommon.
A few years ago, we gradually fined one company two million crowns.
He changed his name and address and there was nothing to do.
The bailiff's case came back, the ads stood on, maybe in other places.
We are quite powerless against such companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admits on condition of anonymity one of the officials.
No one has addressed the law in this regard yet.
He spoke to several members who were interested in the issue.
So far, they have not engaged in any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards at major Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic not only for national, but also for county and municipal politicians.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions, on the other hand, they need them themselves for advertising in election campaigns.
I do not hold the rather well-established impression that if something does not work, then it is necessary to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy seed, statisticians estimate.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet this year’s harvest exceeds the average for the past five or ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed (3.9 percent) and poppy seed (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The grain harvest this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is according to an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a tenth decrease compared to last year.
Last year’s crop was above average.
This year’s harvest exceeds the average for the past five or ten years.
This year, it will be higher than the harvest of rape and poppy seed.
Rapeseed growers harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they received 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year’s poppy crop could be 2.5% higher than last year’s.
The projected decline in cereal production is due both to a reduction of 3.7% per hectare in yield to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and to a decrease in crop area.
Farmers have sown 3 percent fewer fields this year.
Winter wheat, which is the most important grain for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be harvested 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers spread it out into more fields.
However, the fall will sign a lower hectare yield, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
About a fifth of the decline is expected for spring barley, which is most often used for beer production.
The reduction in crop yield is due to a 15.2% reduction in crop area, but also to a lower yield per hectare.
Winter barley, on the other hand, is growing 6.3% more.
The rye harvest will also increase.
The crop is estimated to be 1,305 million tonnes, which is higher than last year.
Sowing areas increased by 7.3 percent.
The yield per hectare will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s crop of rapeseed exceeds the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, and is one-third larger than it was a decade ago.
Poppy fields have also been increasing in the last four years.
This year, the farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when poppy was grown in the Czech Republic on a record 70,000 hectares, however, the fields are half.
Thanks to the extension of the sowing areas, this year's poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise by 2.5% to 27,423 tonnes compared to last year.
The yield per hectare will be 6.1% lower.
Two men have been charged with knife and machete attacks and have been taken into custody by the court.
Police have charged two assailants who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in the centre of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the victim tried to escape, they caused him cutting and cutting injuries, which required treatment in the hospital and further treatment," police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková said.
The two men were arrested immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor filed a motion for their custody and the court granted him on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The attackers inflicted cuts and cuts on him, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that occurred at noon on Tuesday at Svoboda Avenue, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková said.
Mass skirmish between two families took place in the garden in front of the bar Tratoria in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked a 35-year-old man using a knife and machete.
Although the man tried to escape, he suffered cutting and cutting injuries that required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokeswoman said.
The skirmish, which attracted a lot of attention in the city center and forced several police patrols and officers to intervene on the spot, was a family dispute.
Criminals accused the 34-year-old man from Slovakia and the 37-year-old man from Olomouc of trying to cause serious bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The plaintiff filed a motion for the court to take them into custody and the court granted him on Friday, the spokesman added.
Machete was used in the center of Olomouc during a mass battle five years ago, it happened just a few dozen meters away, in front of the disco Varna in Riegrova Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about 10 foreigners with guns had attacked the company's guests who were standing in front of the entrance.
According to police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished the two attacking foreigners with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You might be surprised to see them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovážné Square.
It was supposed to be a hotel.
But still nothing.
Is it necessary to build new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several apartment buildings that, despite their location, size and often monument protection, are empty.
We selected the properties in the centre using the project Vlakédomy.cz, which maps long-term vacant properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relations between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, they want the initiative

The Clintons earned $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year.
They donated more than a million dollars to Clinton for charity.
Most of the Clintons' revenue -- over $6 million -- is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, putting pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year.
Most of Clinton's revenue -- over $6 million -- is for their speeches, largely from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that the Clintons paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, followed by a state and local income tax of 9 percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
Trump, however, has a problem with such a step, so far he has not decided to publish the tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump is not paying any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after publishing her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrecy surrounding Trump’s earnings, including to raise questions about whether her opponent is really as rich as he claims.
Trump’s net worth is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican candidate's reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with the former First Lady, released a report today on his tax payments over the past decade.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and paid 25.6 percent in taxes last year.
Polio has re-emerged in Nigeria.
Boko Haram militants prevented consistent vaccinations and killed doctors.
Cases of polio have reappeared in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government has declared an emergency vaccination, as two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed there.
The vaccines were delivered by helicopter.
In the area, Boko Haram terrorists defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated there undetected.
In northeast Nigeria, an emergency polio vaccination will begin as two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in Borno state and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters quickly delivered polio vaccines to the affected northeast of the country on Friday, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating in the area undetected for many years.
In the past, Boko Haram extremists prevented vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also prevented doctors from reaching areas where children with polio were detected on Thursday.
The two toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
Michel Zaffran, director of the WHO’s polio eradication unit, told the BBC that vaccinations in Nigeria would begin as early as next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in Borno state.
The area was only opened to international organizations and the government at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to significantly weaken in this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole said the new polio cases were a big disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to announce that polio had been eradicated next year.
The WHO said it was possible that although the disease had not occurred for two years, it was still spreading among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases in the world.
While polio was still present in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three regions: Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis has met 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of pimps thanks to police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and invited them to look confidently to the future.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for a strengthening of the fight against it.
In Rome, Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes who were freed from a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the moving stories of the fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to violent physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
The visit was intended to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for a strengthening of the fight against it, the pope’s spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fate of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican this April and June, thanks to his personal invitation.
France is going to hit the jihadist factories.
Without the help of Muslims, this is not possible.
France is to be helped by Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
The government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is also preparing major changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clerics.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer rooms.
Others will follow, the interior minister said.
There are over 100 jihadist factories in the country.
“If Muslims do not help the state fight against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of religion,” Valls said.
In particular, he wants to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer rooms.
At the same time, he wants to stop financing mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad for the construction of new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This is also the reason why preachers come to mosques, who can sow radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," he said.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam was founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, the foundation was supposed to help make the financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction more transparent.
But the institution was soon struck by internal contradictions and rivalry.
“It’s a total failure,” Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015 sparked a debate about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All of this has been accelerated by other terrorist attacks in France carried out by radicalized Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently said a new foundation would be created in October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources, and also to supervise imams.
It is not yet clear where he will get the money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centers.
Several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food.
In practice, halal food vendors would pay to be certified.
Some of that money would go to the foundation.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
About 30,000 go to Saudi Arabia on a traditional pilgrimage each year.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, in the future, only preachers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should operate in mosques.
This should ensure that the preaching is in harmony with democracy.
We'll shut down the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is waging a campaign against the radicals.
And others will follow, the interior minister recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and mosques in the country.
An estimated 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled about 80 imams and are considering it for several more dozen.
However, not everyone thinks that the government’s actions can significantly counteract radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalized will do the same.
It’s not happening in mosques, young people are being radicalized online, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Kelemen lost to Baugé in the 1st round of the sprint.
The Czech track cyclist has to fight for the progress to the eighth round in corrective rides.
The track cyclist Pavel Kelemen lost in the 1st round to the French giant Grégory Baugé, a silver defender from the previous games in London, at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics after advancing from the sprint qualification to the top eighteen.
They have to fight to advance to the eighth round in corrective runs.
27 riders took part in the start of the royal discipline on the track and the best Czech rider of the present time took the 14th best time.
He finished 200 seconds with a quick start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was expected to qualify fifth Baugé, who already has bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
Kelemen, in the end, teased an experienced Frenchman, but he kept an eye on the procedure.
A great performance flashed gold defender Jason Kenny.
The 28-year-old Briton scored the third-fastest two hundred in history and won the qualifiers in the Olympic record 9,551.
As expected, he also managed to cope with the latest advance, which was the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet was also successful with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4 km pursuit race and advanced to the final.
The current record (3:51,659), which had been in place for four years since the London Olympics, has been improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want a fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of the young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association’s Young Doctors Council (JDC) must ask the full board for support for other industry-specific events in early September.
JDC says ministers failed to resolve issues over the treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the election.
In a letter to members published Thursday night on Twitter, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government remained "still quiet" on the issues, prompting a rejection of the contract.
She said, "In this light, the executive body of the JDC voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and demand new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC's executive board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA's board to approve an ongoing program of high-profile industry events from early September.
The dispute led young doctors to declare six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
The leader of the young doctors at the BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which the BMA recommended.
He told BMA members at meetings before the vote before 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Health Secretary said the contract would be a burden for medical practitioners in England.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance of the “Incompatible”?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to an eight-month-long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the sumptuous hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin did not smile and barely radiated warmth, even by his aloof standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken about his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their pre-crisis level, but will be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold emanating from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the downing of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was furious.
Putin punched around and accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The scandal was all the greater because it came from an imaginary friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media has waged a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara for months.
It was as if the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious were allegations from top officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message came that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared such a victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost stripped of power last month during a failed coup and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's sanctions have had a harsh impact - notably the cancellation of charter flights that transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey each year.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly take a breather when flights are resumed.
They earn on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a poor response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-standing animosity of the protracted talks on joining the EU and the entry of Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cooling and sever Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly earned bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change, this is a given.
So the summit at this pompous, seaside palace has allowed Russia and Turkey to demonstrate what one analyst has described to me as “an alliance of the incompatibles”: how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West are joining forces.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently took the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that after nearly three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said in a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin chose to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries can find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster when a NATO member shot down a Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for non-Scotland customers
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand is to be repressed into a back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
She was relieved when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be bailed out of debt.
At the time, strategists used “RBS” to protect other consumer finance brands.
It cost millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sport, from Six Nations rugby championship to Andy Marray's Winbledom champion.
But now it has been decided that it is better to put more emphasis on national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the head office and stock-exchange coding, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that come to the fore - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our visits to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered our questions from Ross McEwan.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand that our employees work for as we become much more of a brand bank now.”
Because the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations championship, preparing a profile of the individual brands sponsoring the sport.
“It’s a good time for us to move to a brand bank because the fundamental question (that we are asking ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?” he said.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would have become a great bank for customers and introduced those brands.
But as we focus on our customers’ needs rather than our own, I think there’s been a lot of change.
We can remind these brands, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket riding the Predilection led to the 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after Newmarket double win brings him 3,000 wins
Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th win in Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second victory of the evening on his local track - the horse Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in flat races.
Its predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion žekje Dettori, who had previously won on horse Ghayyar, said, "It's strange."
I am very touched because my family is here too.
I am extremely glad that this happened at Newmarket, because this is where I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings the Predilection after the victory
Two jockeys have reached this milestone in obstacle racing - jockey champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who have driven more than 4,300 winners to the finish line during his career breaking records.
Lester Piggott, 9-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical figure that makes him different from other riders in earnest.
He is a fantastic ambassador of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he wasn't just riding on weekends and big races, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie has ridden the winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
He's a lively character, which is good for British horse racing, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous flying jump
From flying finishes to flying jumps, Frankie Dettori has been the messenger of British flat racing for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
A plethora of big race winners, including his famous "magnificent seven" in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from taking off because of drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a six-month ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and returned to all doubters in top form.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired the head of the presidential office of Sergei Ivanov
On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired Sergei Ivanov from his post as head of the presidential office.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest collaborators for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin had "released Ivanov from his service as head of the Russian presidential office," but no reason was given.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old was a diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later made the head of the presidential protocol and presidential office.
In appointing Putin, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and controlling the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to step down and recommended that Vajno replace him.
Convince them with smiles?
This move has completely mystified Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin’s closest collaborators and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, the two men said they were leaving at their own request.
But smiling at the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once thought of as a possible president longs to suddenly lead Russia’s environmental policy has been met with great mistrust.
The Kremlin website quotes remarks addressed to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very demanding post, even a problematic one, for four years.
Apparently, I've been president for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously worked for the State Security Committee (KGB) like Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as its deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest collaborators.
There was even speculation that Ivanov might succeed Putin as head of state after his second term, because a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
However, this position was taken over by another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson, Star of Criminal Minds, Released After Hitting Director
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange on the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before announcing his firing.
There were creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I am sorry that this has happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC and CBS, details about how Gibson's character disappears from the series, which follows the stories of the FBI's agent team, a little later.
The 54-year-old actor, best known for his starring roles in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has appeared in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into them for the past 12 years,” Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on September 28.
In the city of Banff mysteriously landed in the garden of the fish
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish may be sand eels left behind by a waterspout.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short film of his find on the Periscope Canal, thinking that someone could help him explain how the five-centimeter fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects to Fife
The 1.35 billion pound project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern platform to Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - the bridge now connects to Fife.
It is therefore the first of the four closures between the “platform fans”, which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The 1.35 billion pound project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the structure today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we have all seen how construction engineers have used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge on a truly impressive scale.
Despite the bridge's massive dimensions and weight, the completion of the closures between the viaduct and the bridge's platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
More than 79% of the total area of the bridge is now in place, concrete for the last parts of the platform is now cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure in the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this cap represents the pinnacle of civil engineering.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the north approach viaduct 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled with a climb of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team worked with were very small - only a few millimeters each way.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men 'happy to be alive'
Three men are “happy to be alive” after being washed away from their Anglesey fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13:20 UK summer time on Friday after the crew saw the incident at Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued unguided.
"We saw their boat circling near them and thought the worst," said Moelfre lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong wind drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a life jacket exhausted holding a buoy.
All were brought aboard the coastal lifeboat and taken back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a rope for an emergency shutdown, but somehow there was a disconnection from the person driving the boat when the overturning occurred.
Someone above was holding a protective hand over the boys.
The judge refuses to solve the case because of the Fatty's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs charged with receiving political traffic from Prime Minister Nečas and his then-head of cabinet, Jana Nagyová, a lucrative post for political concessions.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Šnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř made it possible by their resignations.
They then appeared in influential positions in state-owned companies.
That is why they also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, they were unjustifiably compensated a total of almost 2 million crowns.
The prosecutor is now acting as a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a courthouse in the Fruit Market and settles civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be careful and avoid possible objections.
The case will probably be handled by another Prague court district.
The king has already acquitted Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagyová, twice.
It was alleged to be an abuse of military intelligence to monitor Prime Minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
In this case, the hearing aid did not appear.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated reaction.
I do not think that impartiality can be interpreted as excluding a court if the Witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid nothing could be judged at all, he noted for the newspaper.
"I think it's crazy," he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged in the case of political traffic.
However, according to his attorney Peter Toman, any objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13, the District Court for Prague 1 heard the impeachment of former Prime Minister Petr Nečas’s chief of cabinet Jana Nagyová (now Nečasová) and others accused in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Nečasová and her husband go to court.
She was supposed to be talking about Peroutka.
For example, the ex-member’s wife was to judge the remarks of President Miloš Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutek.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl is believed to have died in an air raid by the Allied forces.
She flew to Syria with her two same-old girlfriends from London's Gatwick Airport last February.
The Home Office did not comment on her death.
According to police, young Londoners who fled their homes were secretly taken to Syria via the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana are reportedly headed for their former classmate at Bethnal Green Academy in London.
The case sparked a huge wave of attention last year, as well as tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined the radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a hundred thousand dollars.
A well-paid job that you don’t even need to go to college for.
At first glance, this is the work of an IT professional.
And often the other.
The advantage is not only extremely high salary (you can earn up to CZK 180,000 by working in IT in Prague), but also extreme benefits.
This is due to a lack of specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, there is a shortage of almost 20,000 IT specialists in the Czech Republic.
According to the statistics of the Grafton staffing agency, the most wanted are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, candidates are not competing for a job, but for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager of Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not necessary for IT professionals.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate’s intelligence and educability, but it often has little to do with knowledge of development.
Developers have to learn new things all the time, which will not be replaced by a university, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most profitable is in Prague.
The wages of IT workers are far above the national average.
Most of the money will come in Prague and Brno, it is no longer such a chart in the regions.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
Technical directors make the most money.
In Prague and Brno they can cost 120,000 to 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but even there it will not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
On arrival, they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
There is also a struggle for graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go directly to the employment office, this does not apply to IT professionals.
If companies drag and overpay an expert from another company, they like to reach for a graduate.
They can raise it on their own.
They cannot do without language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but at least decent English is necessary for IT professionals.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases where companies are looking for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with an average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker speaks more foreign languages, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds Kubačka.
In Google, that’s paradise.
Czech workers can be jealous of Google employees.
Of course, they have flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various part-time jobs, not only for mothers.
“The company gives new dads four weeks of extra leave after the baby is born,” said Martina Jonek, a Google spokesperson.
Pampering also involves health care for employees and family, meals, transportation, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Those who want to learn have the green light, no matter what new they want to learn.
But the benefits don’t end there.
Such a full refrigerator is definitely not to be missed.
A healthy lunch (breakfast and dinner in some localities) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchenettes in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the spokesperson reveals.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, so what is not eaten, put in boxes that employees can take home at night.
And the reason for these incredible benefits in the Czech Republic?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it's not important that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions."
The United Nations has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN human rights commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The Bulgarian government's official strategy "raises serious concern about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law", Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
“It is particularly disturbing to witness important and influential public figures publicly expressing support for criminal armed militias who brazenly hunt for refugees on the Bulgarian-Turkish border,” he said.
“One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory in an irregular manner are automatically arrested,” Zeid said.
Worse, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned for a year or more if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has detained 14,000 migrants this year, up from 21,000 last year.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outdoors and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people off their couches and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of screens initially shrunk to television, later to video games and most recently to smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
I’m talking, of course, about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, a character-based app that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was then postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overloading of servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out in search of Pokémon that they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can “take a picture” (via a screenshot on the phone) or “catch” them.
The mania engulfed the generation that played the game at a younger age, lifting it from its seats and driving it out in search of Pokémon.
In the US, this game has seen a significant increase in the number of steps that the “average” person takes every day.
Apple’s Cardiogram smartwatch app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people who exercised for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees rough data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns to “find 30,” “get off the couch,” and “be active every day” have fallen on barren ground because most public health messages are boring and aimed at people who don’t look good.
The importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot fully list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover the three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine. And fun.
Some people even make new friends in pursuit of Pokémon.
As is the case, there are, of course, boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk in the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their time, smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity, but they didn’t give us a reason to do something like this game.
The news is fading, and interest in it begins to wane at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, other games will emerge that will combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity and help many people in the pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in women’s gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump.
Effortlessly on the beam.
By the simple, they were all speechless.
Excellent in everything.
Finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight to the title in a multi-fight on Thursday and overcame the others at full speed under the Olympic spotlight.
The overall result of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and team member "Final Five" Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the all-around, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and possibly the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey up to that point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This achievement places her in the same league of unique athletes of her time, such as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships - including 10 golds. Her stunning line-ups are a mixture of ambition and precision, and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
Her final test was in Brazil, not so much between Bilesová and the rest of the competitors, but between herself and the burden of too high expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals, would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver medals in the women's all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was as an exclamation point in the celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked ahead during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her simple set-up - one that features a typical triple flip with a double twist - is set in Latin music that would just fit home, in the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
She hasn’t lost a multi-fight competition since summer 2013 - a win streak that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead for a short time thanks to two turns, it was just an illusion.
Hammers and plains - where Bilesová defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back in the lead with 15,433 points for the beam - and finished with 15,933 points in the plain.
Raisman gently hugged her as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the shimmering red, white, and blue shadows, Biles’ tears appeared as she fulfilled a wish she had once written down in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third place with Mustafin, but then she eats bronze because of the sum of the three best sets.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who Americans call "grandmother," was way ahead of her.
After her simple ones, she sent airy kisses to the crowd, surmounted by a return that at times seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post the 19-year-old posted on Twitter this week, where it became a hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three killed in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died in the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in a car, chatting and listening to music.
Authorities reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
The report said an armed man stood on the passenger's side and fired eight shots from a handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the robbery is not worth the triple murder because the attacker did not take the wallets, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims had on her.
A spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators were looking into whether the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, there were a total of nine attacks in four months, in which seven people were killed and two others injured.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of the houses,” Howard told CBS’s KPHO office earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on the scene.
A witness told police it was not uncommon for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder. Police believe that its origin was this serial killer.
Investigators found casings and assembled a bullet from the bullet residue in the seat and from under the engine bonnet.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'His condition is improving'
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike her peers, she suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
The first time he came home, I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
“That is not true,” he said, “but you are ready for it.”
She and her husband Vincent learn that Edmund may never know them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
“My first reaction was that I thought people didn’t do that anymore,” Picciut explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he's still not talking.
But some milestones are already slowly being fulfilled.
He goes with help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth gives a sign language with which Edmund says, “Please sing to me.”
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says Edmund invented some of the signs himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciuto reminds us of the emotional toll that an uncertain future imposes.
I keep asking myself, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall forecast was, because I don’t expect anyone to be able to tell me at all.
Picciut has some encouraging news for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding have prompted rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi are spilling out of their banks and threatening widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's office for national security and emergency preparedness, said they were receiving requests for water-borne vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said only the Tangipaho precinct asked for 10,000 sandbags.
Flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana to work through Saturday.
The meteorological service said in a statement that another 8 to 13 centimerts could rain over the sea.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was on standby on Friday as rains continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
According to the forecast, the rivers Comite near Baton Rouge and Amite near Denham Springs will culminate at the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said the two said they could flood a number of houses in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that downstream flooding in Ascension County is a danger, with these flooded streams pouring into Lake Maurepas only slowly.
The Tickfaw River, slightly south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached local time at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers are still picking up people from torrential waters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step-son were among those rescued at Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson, who lives nearby.
“We woke up and the water was coming,” Hansford said.
I had it all the way to my waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on a river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all members of his family are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three giant military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continue, flooding is “spreading fast” and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rain fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid trips required rescuing residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and cancelling classes in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS reported that 200 homes had been flooded, according to an elder from Tangipaho.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals trapped by the high water.
Shelters were set up in the village of Amite and in the town of Hammond for those who were evacuated.
“They will be able to come home when the water starts to fall,” he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed because of the flood, and locals were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
“We had the last major flooding here in March,” said city manager Lacy Landrum.
These floods are going to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, emergency manager for Harrison County, Mississippi, said there was continued rain on the Gulf coast.
He said a couple of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods at Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in several places I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and it’s still there.”
Mahaj Brown (6) - "boy shot like a rock", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia this week, marking the second shooting at a six-year-old child in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious while being transported to the hospital.
“He took too much, his little body was shot like hell,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should be healed.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three other men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, the other two victims are in stable condition.
According to the station's report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia said there was likely to have been a shootout between several armed men.
Shell casings from assault-type weapons belonging to various assault weapons were found at the scene.
It certainly was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the pavement.
So it seems that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been arrested and police are reportedly examining video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray shot on Tuesday outside a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women's team of gymnasts for this year's Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I’ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And two: There are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired so many young, colorful girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also consolidated the presence of blacks and Latinos at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, she has been an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were in first and second place last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's singles all-around.
And team member Aly Raisman won the silver.
We are witnessing a sporting peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country it does not look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the “final five” because the team of gymnasts for the next Olympic Games will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi trains.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mostly in private gymnastic clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, trips, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their wards and families). And that is far from it.
Most of these sports clubs are in affluent areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs gymnasts have all the trainings, and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is an expensive and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both coached athletes while they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics trainings that are more accessible and accessible to the communities of the countless young girls that inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 young people within the city (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, success in school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics. And that is great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing “girl power” and winning Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on the journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors ready to enter more strikes
Ministers hoped to end disagreements over the changes after a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt revealed plans in July to enforce the contract, saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work practices to improve care in non-social hours.
Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA’s Young Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labor crisis and therefore fair treatment for all doctors.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation have been met with reluctance to involve Dr. and often with deafening silence on the part of the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for enforcement, and address the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take the next steps.
During the last strike in late April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called in to represent the doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers hoped that following the conclusion of a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements over the changes would be concluded.
The BMA wants higher pay for work over the weekend for the 54,000 young doctors that would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “Industry action will achieve little or nothing, but there will be pressure on already overburdened teams and services, and there will be concern, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with a board of young doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave, and gender pay gap - was proof of how seriously employers, Health Education England, and the Department of Health are taking the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February, and May.
Drug for 60 crowns a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of a heart attack will be able to take the drug, which costs around 60 crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend giving it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The anti-clotting medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a seizure occurring again in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for 12 months after having a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or other attack.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer breaks off, a blood clot can form, blocking blood access to the heart and causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, blocking the blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another attack.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by British firm AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely to form.
In a draft NICE directive published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will suffer another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a patient’s quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased to be able to extend the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who will benefit from Ticagrelor’s preliminary recommendation.
Because there is limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - particularly on the risk of bleeding - beyond three years, treatment beyond this period is not recommended in the design.
With computer culture began to flourish fraud in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year over corruption linked to a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the neglect of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, the government report said today.
Ex-Secretary of State Sir Eric Pickles has harshly criticized police, election inspectors and city halls for ignoring voter abuse over "oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former community secretary, now the ruler of anti-corruption crackdowns, said that intimidation of voters based on their religion is so bad that police should make cordons in front of the polling stations and protect the alert voters.
He recommended that voters take their identity documents with them so they can prove who they are at the election.
Currently, voters only need to provide their name and address.
The report also suggests applying indelible ink to people's fingers when casting a vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It asks that the press be given greater access to the documents of the meetings and to the decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only about protecting against election fraud, but also protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and the financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal at Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, a special election court ruled incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his post following allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had “cynically interfered” with the religious sensibilities of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said he “led his campaign to make it a religious duty for devout Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes have been contested or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and impersonates someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the postal vote - which is claimed to have put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, pictured, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the submission of an identity document
“Evidence has been presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“There was concern that ... state institutions were turning a blind eye to such behavior because of a ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric has made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondent votes to prevent "voting."
The report, which is now being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks during registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider the possibility of requiring voters to present proof of identity before voting.
Use indelible ink on people's fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conducting systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic postal voting shall be limited to a period of three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating submitted ballots and election envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordons around polling stations.
Change laws to make it easier to prosecute persons exerting unlawful coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibit taking photos in polling stations.
Require only English people to work in polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that workers adhere to the rule that voters go to the polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police, saying it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The Electoral Court has ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of the evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes the fruitless "check boxes" in the voter registration departments at the town hall.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's court decision in the Tower Hamlets case by awakening.
Our nation has the proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Infatuated with the cycling doppelganger Duchess Kate and other doppelgangers of famous personalities at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games this week went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is far from the only gold-hungry athlete this year who boasts her own celebrity double - at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL’s Women’s column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to the Kate doppelganger on the bike track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archer Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after images emerged of him strikingly resembling a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted that he had been hearing about his resemblance to Leo since he was a child.
"They don't see any great resemblance themselves, except perhaps a beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin, with her big, expressive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell star Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks Nathan is the "athletic version" of the actor from the film Inception
Another long-standing comparison is that of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov not only boasts the same dark complexion and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And Nathan Adrian from the USA team, fans say, looks like "an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Fit Women: Soccer star Hope Sol (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face and eye shape
Not just one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarities
On the waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind a similar look of pairs
One Twitter user recently expressed satisfaction on the site that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are in fact identical.”
Soccer star Hope Sol and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, or gold medalist for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her wonderfully wide smile, which seems to copy the smile of Gabrielle Union, star of the movie Bravo, girls!
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer ‘exploded’
Spectators of Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympic Games on the CBC station were outraged by the analysis of the performance of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place in the women's 4x200 m relay in free style
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “stretched like a stink” and “blown up” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone was turned off when, at the end of the women's 4x200-meter relay final, he began churning out his own opinions in freestyle.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring a “recovery” to the CBC team, said: “That little 14-year-old from China gave up, man.”
Too much excitement, stretched like a stench, exploded.
Oh, thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in a time of 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed Canadians to follow China.
Viewers in Canada quickly began to speak up online and were horrified by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “Did the CBC announcer say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China had ‘exploded’????”
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's relay race at 4x200 meters freestyle was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's Twitter criticism came from all sides, and many demanded his dismissal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn’t hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon after, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who leaked to the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry it happened."
CBC has apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment.
Scott Russell Apologizes to MacDonald
The CBC then copied and posted their apology in a response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about comments made by commentator MacDonald.
The station also quickly apologized and released statements.
She sincerely regrets that the words were uttered, she shouldn't have gotten on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to those who follow us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live broadcast, attempting to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want it to come out as a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said in a broadcast from the Olympics on CBC.
"I meant the performance of the swimmer and not the person of the swimmer as such."
Needless to say, I had no intention of disrespecting you and I’m very sorry.”
Customers in Primark scandalized by a woman who shamelessly tried on her underwear in the middle of a store
When the woman undressed to try on her panties on the shop floor in the middle of Primark, shoppers weren’t sure which way to look.
To make matters worse, she tried to fit her size, took off her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and eventually tried on four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place mall in Flokestone.
Primark store at Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her panties before putting them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman “dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything” after trying on her underwear.
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own tights and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet spot - she just stood there, cheeky as a monkey."
“Everyone just stared at her as she took her panties off again, and she obviously didn’t like them because she put them back on the shelf.”
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn’t like anything, got dressed again and left.
“She didn’t seem to mind who she was looking at, not even thinking about the person who might have bought the panties she was trying on.”
Miss Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "The idea that someone would take home panties that someone else was wearing and nobody would clean them.
The event occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "When she left, I picked up things she was obviously trying to pull from the sale - which is also the right thing to do."
“I would be terrified to bring home new panties and find that another woman was wearing them, took them off, and that they weren’t washed.”
A Primark store spokesman said: “Primark is aware of an incident that occurred at our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9.”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend yourself against a gun attack with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but with this video from Dailymail.com, it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhone Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over a rapist, whether they approach you from the front or the back.
If they approach you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and “have a clear shot path.”
You then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder just before hitting it in the face with your free elbow.
Then follows the knee to the groin, and while the attacker is writhing in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit his head in the face, and begin to recede, holding the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it is a similar technique - get your body off the firing line, grab a gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, put strength into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip and begin to retreat, while still aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of a mugging - unless you're the Grandmaster of Krav Maga - is to issue all the cash.
Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest places in travel guide
The British traveler decided to put his immune system and gag reflex to the test - licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, licked a euro bill with his tongue to prove the strength of his immune system, railing at Piccadilly Circus, flush button on a train toilet, and a Russian public phone.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
The experiment that led to Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength produced interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of other people may seem absolutely repulsive, but there are actually many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about strengthening gut flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left anything worse than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Ian Wright is known for testing the resistance of his intestines on trips around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system quite safely - from public railings at train stations to a flushing device.
In the film, he says, “I haven’t cared much about my health since I was a kid, and I put everything in my mouth, from dirt to eating worms and mud water.”
He confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple smear, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia, however, refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60.
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a traveler’s film called The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, he said, “This is almost the ugliest thing I’ve ever felt in the bathroom.”
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen the gut bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would track interest and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a bunch of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in gut health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health, and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy guts is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought consumers more detailed information in an interesting way.
I also think there is a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of the stuff I wanted him to do - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, while others were pretty hard.
I'm glad we did some of the dirty stuff."
A 2015 Valio survey found that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and gut health, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally used products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Family of Socially In Need Destroys Municipal Building in Saltash, Cornwall
A family of the socially needy has left a damage charge of 50,000 pounds on their community home after being accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from the house, the housing cooperative officials were shocked to learn that the property was in a state of disrepair.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, there was rubbish everywhere on the floor, and the walls were scrawled.
The family has already moved away and is considered to live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing issues at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned about whether the house could be saved.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, as this property will probably come to be known as the “not-so-nice part” of Cornwall.
The family is infamous, and their names are infamous.
The couple have three sons who have resided in the house from time to time, and police said the terror the family practiced included street fights using baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud shouting, quarrels, and swearing.
Skeldon (47), whose name was on the lease, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, smelly garbage was found.
In the house where the drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn out
Neighbors say they saw them fighting on the street, and regularly people called the police here
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after being given an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The neighbors, relieved, welcomed the eviction, saying that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, “They didn’t care about anyone at all.”
We've lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, there's no counting.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because there was an incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a neighborhood supervisor at Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Garbage and old toys were lying in an overgrown part of the village house
She adds: “It is a shame that the tenant has not been able to accept responsibility for her and her family’s behaviour, and eviction is always the last step Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their actions must have terrified her neighbors, according to the witness.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police from Devon and Cornwall, and the members of the local community who bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbours and at the same time carry the message that we will not tolerate antisocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said all three of the tenant's sons, who lived in the house at different times, were about 20 years old.
Contaminated mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after eviction
Workers will now have to remove piles of trash left around the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment, and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined for being found guilty of possession of Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was intended for the foundation of a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her eviction partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their leases
Angela Crow of the Denov and Cornwall police said the eviction was a clear message to other tenants who will continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and to those who would like to follow that behaviour," she said.
The police of Denov and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after low-flying military jet plane over beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun’s rays in Portuguese Aveir were scared to death
The P-3C Orion was flying incredibly low.
The Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted there was no threat to safety.
As the low-flying jet descended over the crowded beach, the frightened tourists panicked.
The dramatic footage shows a military aircraft getting within close range of the sunning people on a sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to get up after being disturbed by the noise of the jet's engines, not seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic flyby on social media, said: “The plane flew over twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed and really thought the plane was going to fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a low-flying plane appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify a fishing boat off the coast and had to take it low because it was the only way to inspect the boat.
The aircraft is said to have flown slightly lower than normal due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that the safety of people has not been compromised.
Forest fires this summer destroyed part of mainland Portugal, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to thick fog and smoke from fires that had obstructed his view.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify a fishing boat as part of the training.
Half the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (ČOI) found this during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services most often do not inform the bereaved about their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The CTIA imposed 41 fines with a total value of CZK 73,000.
This was reported today by its spokesperson Jiří Frahlich.
The inspectors found errors in 47 of the 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services have also sold products or provided services at different prices than agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified gauge.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This concerned packaging for urns, candle covers and vases that were not properly labelled with mandatory information.
"Given the fact that there are still violations of the law in this specific area of services, the inspection action will continue in the next quarter of this year as well," Frehlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, was reported to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned of her death in Syria's Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the bastion of the group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with going to a war zone - is that it will discourage people from ever making a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The family of Sultana learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria - and she was widowed within a few months.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will keep Garland as a Supreme Court candidate.
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid says he believes Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, although President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person to replace the late Supreme Court judge will be elected by the future president.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he believed Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of credibility."
Reid's spokesperson later stated that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and that he was merely speculating.
He praised Garland, saying that the Clinton team would not want to “swing the boat” by electing someone else.
Garland is chairman of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's appointment are "minors" and "minors" of the Republican candidate for the presidency of Donald Trump.
He said Trump was unfit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for "women and men"
Treats magazine is working closely with photographer David Bellemer to release the 2017 calendar, inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of revealing celebrities, NU Muses is trying to find the next generation of top models for its 2017 calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nudity magazine was different from Playboy’s old school magazine because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is, too.
“We need to return to portraying timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of the female body,” Shaw said in a statement.
Women want to be a part of this project because it is a wonderful piece of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys gramophone records?
Vinyl is loved by lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to overwhelm the comment section with fiery comments under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMen in Middle Age, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of gramophone records is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to revel in the originality of owning a physical object, but with middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely to be people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people between the ages of 18 and 24 are the least likely.
It’s not really about accumulating an enthusiastic fan either - it has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to want to retain their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog had been broadcast as a TV report, I would have been watched by a camera going out onto a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit, and gesticulating widely. Then I would have stopped, pulled out my hands, and said something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at this."
So let's take a look.
While Soho’s charm and charm are slowly fading from its heart - buildings once occupied by independent vendors, now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, clothing and office supplies - several fantastic specialty record stores remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while, and I'll get close to the different men in these stores and try to see what their age and emotional state of mind is.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow whom I follow from Sister Ray (counts: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counts: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and is browsing the shops to fill in a few hours of time.
I asked him if he was a collector.
“I think so,” he says.
I have about three or four thousand records.
All the recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he sent me a picture by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge number of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records that he could not afford when they were originally released, and he buys again what he sold in his youth and had not a penny.
“A lot of what I buy is from the late 1960s and the early 1970s. These are things that would have been issued when I was 11 or 12. I was too small to buy them at the time,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are probably introverts who like to keep themselves company, adding: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez, 25, works at Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers she meets fit the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave, people who had heard of the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old gramophone records back.
According to my interviews, people were getting rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back,” he says.
This could explain the boom of phonograph record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of gramophone records?
It doesn’t take more than a few seconds for you to discover in a store like Phonica that you’ll find a welcoming community of like-minded people in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly upset by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of gramophone records may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of gramophone record covers, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or owning something tangible can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I’m a collector myself, and I think so, too, for a lot of people.
It's an easy way to fill a space in your head.
“We are all like their social workers!” says a co-worker from a pile of gramophone records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had yet to hear it.
According to the survey, 41 percent of those surveyed have a turntable they never use, while 7 percent of those who buy turntables do not.
At this point in the coverage, he probably seemed seriously concerned about going through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
The aspect of "trophies" and a resurgence of interest is something Jonny (42) has noticed working in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
“Someone recently came in and said, ‘I don’t have a record player yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead so we can put it on the shelf,’” she says.
The percentage is not large, but it does happen.
It’s more about the product than the music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a tape recorder."
These are younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fop, where almost the entire floor is reserved for gramophone records, has at my arrival much more diverse visitors.
There are couples in their seventies, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the stores used to be - the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex is heard from the speakers, it is good to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but intrusive mental trauma is hard to predict when you’re standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, walks for a few minutes in Fop and looks at the various gramophone records on sale.
She's one of those people who's more likely to look at expenses than spend them feverishly.
She says she doesn't make much money, so it's out of the question for her to collect records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but gramophone records have their charm...," he sighs longingly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My final stop is the store that supposedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans and watch a group of teenage girls just flocking around Polaroid cameras, then father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is covered by the gramophone records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone records.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just for decoration, and some are so high up on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's a pure "vinyl trick".
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
Unsurprisingly, the demographic area where there is more time and money than in other areas is also the one where the most luxury goods are spent, as vinyl certainly is.
But while according to my findings, YouGov’s results appear to be accurate - at least in record stores, they don’t account for the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record stores and on online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
I'm sure he doesn't spend his Thursday morning wandering around the record stores on Berwick Street, browsing records and avoiding the sight of a strange, 30-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the footage shows a female estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and measuring five meters tall.
French Court Refuses to Demolish Shops at Jungle Refugee Camp
A court in France has rejected an order by authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais objected that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, in makeshift restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic dishes for several euros.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites needed to be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay taxes and because they posed fire hazards and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations have said in court that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups do not provide a food supplement for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Disputed makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from running 72 makeshift stores, but said that Calais's objections were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-Francois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role to play than simply serving food to people who “live in extremely dire conditions.”
He said the premises provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One site threatened with demolition was a cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals a day, hours of English and French, and asylum counseling for hundreds of unaccompanied minors at risk in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children’s café.
The Guardian received a letter saying the closure of the café would be “a disaster for these children, some as young as 8 years old.”
Help Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the refugee numbers in the camp had risen to more than 9,000 over the summer, the highest ever.
He thought he was dead.
The ulč resurrects itself and volleyball Ústí.
"Since March I could train normally," he reported at the start of the summer training in full force.
What was wrong with you?
I had a double-sided pulmonary embolism, and then heart problems because of it.
Because when I was at Universiade in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know it.
I was in pain, no one found me anything.
Then the clot went up.
There is a damaged vein in the calf, which will hurt all the time, especially when the weather changes.
But nothing to limit me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
I did.
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevěnice, I did not know that I had an embolism, and I could not move there at all.
I threw up blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was completely finished for five more days.
I really thought I was dead in Wooden, including my friends and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going to go up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to watch myself more when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything.
Just when I wanted to go back to Příbram preparation last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it, I'm physically better than I was before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm looking forward to it, the group looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers who are coming.
Maybe we'll sit down humanely so it fits together.
Will you lift the Estuary?
It had a reputation of being a knockout, but every season is different.
Two years ago it was eighth, now it is second.
There is a new team in Ústí, there are only a few players left.
It was the last one in the Extraliga, so there is a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first laps who's going to be the batter, we don't think so.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He is already experienced and experienced a lot, he will think of a better than last place.
But my arrival was unrelated to his, I agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I am a big friend and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say the name.
Finally Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for decades, he's a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to chat and I like to get an opportunity in a not so top team.
I was in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, Australian Boehm is already training in Ústí.
What does he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in a group at the Universiade.
And we talked a few times there, sometimes we sat together in the evening after the matches, so we already know each other in a friendly way.
We beat them 3:1, I immediately gave it to him at the start of the summer preparation in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he is a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will also arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to an American, he looks like a nice guy, Brazilian who knows how he will speak English.
You contacted an American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, so I should be communicating with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of player he was, I found him playing on the internet, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he fits in with us.
How do you feel about being number one in the recording industry?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I’m 24 and I don’t have the temper to do it.
I'd rather be in the center of the action, I'd rather lead it than be led by someone else.
I don't think I'd want to play anymore if I had to be a second record player and do it at full time.
How many times have you been number one?
Half a year in Příbram, when it was not possible for Kust as the captain, he got injured, then there were problems with money and he left.
We've been climbing ever since, and I've been playing all the time.
I have been to the one and two of them.
It was an excellent year in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and I chose Příbram.
Budějovice wanted me there, I stayed, but I didn’t finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short position remains Phelps' domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes filled with tears again.
His fiancée and mother were cheering in the audience again, this time Boomer’s son slept peacefully with headphones on.
I am having an amazing week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming racing and in a few hours it will all be over, he said touchingly.
In the final behind Phelps by almost two seconds behind silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long position.
The bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championships.
After Al Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to dominate the same discipline in four games in a row.
For most of the race, Phelps was led by fellow American Ryan Lochte and home-grown Thiago Perreira.
While the gold defender in the final fifties put on a crushing finish, they fell out of medal positions.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the opening ceremony, he advanced to the final of the 100 metres butterfly race.
The legend could not be overshadowed by compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won a double - after a hundred won in Rio and double track.
In the final, he left Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin by 37-hundredths, while Russia's Evgeny Rylov finished third.
While Murphy is only fifth in the 200th World Championship last year, he has become the signer king of Rio.
He dethroned Larkin from the imaginary throne, who achieved the same double at last year's World Championship.
He has just won a medal at the Olympics.
Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel shared the gold at the 100th Kraulars.
For sixteen-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuel's second after the silver from the relay.
She was the first African American to win gold at the Olympic Games.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
"This medal is for all those who come after me, the sport becomes love for them and they get to where I am," Manuel said.
The third place went to the Swedish Sarah Sjostrm, who won the 100 metres butterfly race in Rio and still has silver from the 200 metres.
Australia’s Cate Campbell finished sixth.
Japan’s Rie Kanet won the 200th Olympic gold medal at the age of 27.
It has no valuable metal from the World Championships, its maximum was fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
Russia’s Yulia Efimovova won the second silver in Rio, battling animosity from both spectators and rivals due to her start at the games despite her doping past.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
“I’m very tired,” said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was obtained by a special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the games.
They were dealing with my appeal, and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, they should go to the arbitration court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And the start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a strange day.
Less than an hour before the match, they knew who they were going to face.
They had to make a quick tactical preparation.
And then, at an unusual time, they started the match on a small court number 1.
The first set did not start well, then they made the lead of the opponents, but in the 19:19 they did not manage to finish.
In the second they were clearly better and equalized, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
First of all, a number of broken service meant a 10:15 loss and parting with the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," Hermann lamented.
How would you rate the match?
Hermannová: After an unfortunate start, before I started playing, we got into the game.
In the end, I lost the income I had gotten used to in the last balloon.
We lost the set, which was the key.
In the next set, we got on them with an overview on the pitch, a different defense and pushed for service.
There was a lot of bad stuff going on in the tie-break, and that's where we went down this side.
It was a disappointment because we could beat the Russians.
It’s a shame to start the first set, that’s where we missed it.
We were able to pull it off, but we were missing points.
The second set was great and the third set was decided by the service.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and it was about the five, there we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play on the small court number 1?
Just like in China on the other side.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock in the night, complete silence, the music was not playing, there was nothing.
It was different from the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose.
How was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was strange.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn’t do tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (coach Nausch) prepared a tactic for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers, so we were pretty well prepared for this.
Do you ever start a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at half past ten, but not at twelve.
Russian Birlov's block in the opening round of the playoffs at the Rio Olympics.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermannová embraced in the opening round of the playoffs at the Rio Olympics.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: Having played the last two games in the group from ten, we had the regime shifted before.
This was two more hours.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine any other sport has athletes who have to perform their best at twelve o’clock.
But I think we did the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it’s not typical and it’s probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you feel about the Olympic experience?
Hermannová: Since progress from the group was our goal, on the one hand it is fine, good.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
I will sleep on it and from tomorrow I will only remember the Olympic tournament in a positive way.
Big Brother is here, here comes the first spy SIM.
You can't escape her.
The new rules will apply to anyone without a Thai passport who chooses to use a local operator’s SIM while in Thailand.
This applies not only to tourists, but also to people with long-term visas who work in Thailand or have married there.
The Secretary General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, said there would be no exceptions.
The plan to sell the SIM exclusively to foreigners was introduced by the national telecom regulator in early August.
The authorities intend to introduce a new measure to monitor their location within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security, which will allow to solve the crime committed by foreigners.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIM should help to detect people who exceed the permitted length of stay.
For retailers, a special SIM for foreigners should appear next to the SIM designed exclusively for Thais within six months.
A difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently turned on for cards intended for persons without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
“This feature is not available for Thais with SIM, because we can always easily monitor them,” Tantasith added.
It should be noted that in Thailand subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators gave out a free starting SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecoms regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are considering introducing the same measure as Thailand.
Mandatory SIM registration is also currently in place, however, it is not possible to legally use the tracking system.
However, the planned measure does not mean that foreigners are obliged to purchase a local SIM when entering the country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
Operators of a given country know only the relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after logging in to their network.
They know the phone number, but not the owner’s information.
However, the difference in roaming prices from local operators is so wide that most tourists will start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities’ efforts to control the movement of foreigners in Thailand have received immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and compares the planned system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, if necessary, the police will need to follow a specific person with a court order.
For any abuse of the system, there will be an unspecified penalty.
"If a service provider tracks the location of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While at present a specific number will be recycled only after the 90-day period after which the SIM did not log on to the network, if Thailand leaves, the number could be restored after 15 days.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and jacuzzi on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the care for the property is provided by the administrator.
The condition was sufficient parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older buildings.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with swinging the floor, high energy consumption and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old buildings are not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Poláková from the Artiga studio.
Why did you address them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone if he designs the apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client’s wishes, are able to match the interior appropriately.
We already worked with architect Lenka Langerová on our mountain apartment, at that time based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us when renovating our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with adequate facilities for a family of four conceived as a modern but not cold interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with terraces and to implement smart home control.
Of course, the quality of the implementation had to be monitored.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you interfere with the final form of the interior yourself?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expected from the design and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vyšil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, has helped the architect to orientate herself in our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was an architect’s idea as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc.
Were there any complications during the implementation, because of which you had to give up the original ideas or, on the contrary, accept the new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we arrived at the construction site at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we had planned were actually shielding the surrounding buildings.
Then we literally changed the layout overnight.
Granite was used on the kitchen counter and on the lining of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, such as the upholstery of dining and bar chairs Norma from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you making any changes or is there something you wish you had done differently today?
I believe that this is a modern airy interior, which above all serves its purpose.
We do not plan changes, most of the modifications after moving in took place in the level of shading and settlement of terraces.
Perhaps the only reproach is to the floor, when walnut wood turns out to be too delicate for a home with a dog.
The word architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the top floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout and several other modifications.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of skylights in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
This gave daylight to the darker areas of the apartment.
Also direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the construction modifications that was very beneficial to the function of the whole apartment.
It also includes a swimming pool and hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before moving to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
I've moved around quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which led me to work in a magazine.
Why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was starting to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere.
I thought every Frenchman was negative.
People in France are negative in general, but things have gotten worse lately.
It’s interesting that you mention negativity.
This is how some people view the Czech character.
You are not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel that way when they come to France because they don’t see it as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
A big issue is money.
People feel that they have little money, but the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is a problem with the behavior of people towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking down on me just because I was Muslim.
Like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and I came across a vacancy with Air France here in Prague.
I have to admit that I didn’t know about Prague at the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I did not know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mostly because of a different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or swearing, but I feel like people are more free here.
That I could do anything, dress any way, and no one would judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you in a bad way, for example, when you have special clothes and things like that.
In Prague, I started to feel really free.
I don't think that's the kind of thing that Prague people care about.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then, with another friend, we set up a website where people offer and search for shared housing.
So far, we only operate in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are half Czech, and two more Czech friends.
I have to say that another peculiarity of the Czechs is that they keep their distance at first.
They won't let anyone near their body right away.
This is quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don’t speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even at bedtime or at the grocery store.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don’t have that much time.
And since everyone can communicate at least a little in English, I do not have such a need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you experienced any negative reactions?
Is it because you are Muslim?
Not really.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My manager, a Czech, once told me about a French football team and said something like this: They’re not French, they’re Africans.
I'm quite touched by that.
But if anyone has a problem with me being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
This is despite the fact that a colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown, they'd call me names.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar could happen in Paris, Nice or Brussels?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen anywhere these days.
Until recently, I couldn’t imagine something like this happening in France.
This is not just about Muslims.
Islam does not recognize violence.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists shield themselves from your beliefs?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel it at all.
I try not to watch the violence stories too much, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that isn't really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met on the square of Jiřího z Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But the way I see it, these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues are from Egypt and other Muslim countries, for example.
They are a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam, because we all perceive it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, for example, they learned Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate status of a woman.
How do you see it?
I don't feel submissive at all.
Quite the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It also means that you don’t have to wear a head covering.
Like the hijab?
And the way I've been raised is what makes it so special.
My mother, for example, is a true Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on how everyone interprets it.
When you read the Koran, you should make up your own mind about these things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur'an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, for example, where headscarves are required, I will wear it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
For now, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I was thinking about Poland for a while, but I feel great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims together with Christians demonstrated against the violence.
The Kozel Fencl wind in Rio blew on the advancing rungs.
Friday's trips at sea in Rio de Janiero were made by the Czech yachtsman Veronika Kozelská Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to tenth place before the final two races.
This would ensure that the Czechs would participate in the final run.
Collect the packets like a Pokémon.
They want to compete with carriers.
The idea to use the already planned routes for the transport of consignments is supported by the TV director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea in mind, they brought to life three applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the national transfer application in May.
At the moment, there are thousands of cities in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this before we focus more on abroad, the 41-year-old manager says in an interview for iDNES.cz.
How does the Transfer app work and who can benefit from it?
Download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data, how big you can transfer and how much you want for it.
Someone is asking for a transfer that day.
When the route and time of delivery match, this is paired and mutual notifications are sent to both of them.
At that moment, a chat will open, where the couple will arrange a handover.
How many people would you estimate would need to register so that each package would always find its courier?
I don't know the ideal state, I can't estimate how many registered and how many trips are needed to cover the optimal and each offer paired with demand.
On the main routes it already works and it is logically easier than, for example, on the way between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
So far, people are building trust and finding out that no one can escape with the package.
Have you not had to deal with such a case yet?
How many users has the service after two months of launch?
We currently have between 5,000 and 6,000 people building roads.
We consider this a success and believe that others will be added.
Is there a risk that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to be competitive with large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the item on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
For a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
You have to pay a hundred dollars or less, because that’s the path that someone is already taking.
Should traditional carriers be worried about the possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, with huge multinational carriers feeding here, as well as retail chains where everyone started shopping and gradually discovered that quality does not match what they pay for.
No one wants to find a note in their mailbox saying to pick up the package at the branch, at least the day after 7 p.m.
At that time, I needed the package for six hours and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and more functional service that doesn’t annoy anyone and sends a signal to competitors to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
No one has ever worked in the information technology industry.
Marek Greger works as a manager of a music club, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started to prepare the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already planned trips between the world’s capitals, mainly by plane, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
Programming took three quarters of a year and the app was launched in March 2016.
The Převezu application was started in December last year and released in May this year.
It is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The application was developed by Mesík and Mesík Profi since this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to do all these applications from the beginning, which will one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The sharing economy has been a topic lately, and this is a service like AirBnB or Uber.
Aren’t you worried about working in an area that no one can tell you much about yet, where there is a border of sharing and where there is a grey economy?
It’s the same, just a different product.
It is clear to us that if this is successful and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the side of the grey economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, the intention is not to bypass the tax authorities and tax controls.
Every user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make income from it.
How do you think the service has so much potential?
The shipper saves and the ferryman earns, respectively, reduces the cost of the trip.
That's the strong idea that unites interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks, which divide people, we would like this one to bring them closer together.
Good stories can be created, people are happy that they helped someone and they will tell about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People, I think, have been lacking a personal approach for a long time, we say about this application that it is a service of people to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier won’t run away with the package?
Each user of the application, together with registration, scans his/her identity card and indicates his/her bank account, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give credibility to service and to man.
Couriers also collect asterisks based on sender ratings.
We will also offer insurance, we will fine-tune the details.
The courier is liable for uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, but does not assume liability for the contents under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and he is not aware of it.
If he is stopped by the police and finds a machine gun or ten kilos of hashish in a sealed package in his trunk, criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered users are, if necessary, traceable by an administrative authority, which will be the only one able to see it, even we ourselves are not able to see them, the data are protected against misuse.
How much money will the courier get after successful delivery?
The courier sets the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender will be charged a few extra percent for arranging the contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent, because we want to push the volume.
Also, no one can accuse the courier that he did not deliver the package when he actually delivered it, the receipt and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in terms of the size or the content of the package?
You can transfer anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plato of eggs and large as a bass of beer.
After that, there are no more restrictions and if someone has a place in the car, they can transport the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the application, so the courier can see what he wants.
You don’t even have to pack things if you don’t want to hide the content.
You put the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to launch the service?
My friend got the idea more than two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention to it at the time.
Then he showed me a demo application with a transnational reach that targets mainly air passengers.
At that moment I told him that I would not look for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put my savings into it.
It took another year of development before we founded Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the entire product.
This is not the version you are focusing on.
No, we focused our marketing on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to improve the application, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to solve and improve.
We try to respond to customer feedback and we do not deal with the foreign market so much at the moment.
We know it’s a long run, but we don’t want to, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were kind of upgrades.
The transfer was made when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the Mesím is local, for the city.
But it can send a package to the exact address to the other end of the world.
It works for senders as well as transport, but the difference is that in it as a courier you can see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
Applications for couriers who want to make a living with it, we have called the City of Profi.
So someone can make a fortune picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last application will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the most of their trip to work.
Now that everyone's fooling around with the Pokémon, they can collect this just the same.
One sees where the orders are around the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it must be delivered and transports the shipment.
It’s cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we are still doing a web interface, which will be crucial for companies to send shipments, they will fill in data about them on the web, that is, they will create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them for the use of the service every month.
Are you working on the project full-time?
It's exhausting, but it's normal for us to work so that we can support and develop the project.
There is no strong multinational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other suggestions and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to handle not the Czech market, but who should go with us to a global product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
Titanfall 2 is an almost forgotten story.
This will correct the second part and the solo game will be more varied than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the content should be based on the concept of network competition in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to the freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility to use the fighting titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will also include levels focused on skillful movement.
They will resemble platformers and include puzzles.
To overcome them, double jumps, running on walls and a rope slide are therefore essential.
Sometimes it is necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will also be maps resembling mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and slide platforms and close massive doors.
In this way, you will adjust the form of the battlefield.
As a result, the pace of the game should oscillate between fierce action and calmer moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We're gonna be Jack Cooper's pawn dreaming of a pilot's career.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper and Captain Lastimosa are stranded on the alien planet of Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
Nor will the wilderness be lenient to him.
In addition, Lastimosa suffers fatal blows in the crash, and Cooper is tasked with commissioning the captain's titan.
His dream of becoming a pilot will come true sooner than expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery needed for the robot's repair.
Cooper's titanium calls will also be significant.
They will serve as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time, the robot's depersonalized communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when the titanium will dryly list all the injuries that Cooper is at risk of in a planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 came from Polygon.
In addition, the result will be judged in two months, and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 launches on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original label remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the THQ publishing house in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the company’s logo and name.
For example, Nordic released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 more games are being created for the label, and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, by the time I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found our neighbor, a man 20 years younger than me.
I knew it from the beginning - she obviously tried it for a long time, then they got together.
She's such a big guy, probably her type, 'cause she's dated someone like me.
She's totally into him.
In those early days, her voice even changed, she had this girlish, love-speak.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
I watched the whole thing.
He was going to work regularly at 3:30, so she always left at 3:00 to go shopping.
She tried every day to see him.
Later, I found out they were meeting in his house, in the laundry room.
How many times have I known they were there?
I got the keys, he was determined I'd catch them there.
But I don't know why, in the end I always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go there, take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife controlled me mentally.
I think she soon found out I was controllable, that I was going to do what she wanted.
And I did.
Maybe I'm just a weasel.
My neighbors told me they knew it too.
I was so stupid, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
In the family, only my daughter knew.
So I always put it off, on and on.
One day I went to his apartment to ask for help in the laundry.
He went with me, and I told him that I had received an anonymous message, that he was seeing my wife, and that it was all in evidence.
I asked him what he would say.
He stood there, shrugged his shoulders, looked down at the ground and didn’t say a word.
Then I met his wife on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it.
She didn't react to it, and she didn't say anything to me either.
Nobody told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of person who's never been around much, who has trouble meeting people, let alone finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I kept counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her and life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've basically never been able to deal with all of this.
I still have it in me to this day.
I used to let her know a lot, but in the end, I gave it up for peace of mind.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
She's just more like my wife my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's hardworking.
I’ve always wanted to have no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's nice.
But sometimes I want to caress her, hug her, and she won't let me.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage.
She once told me that she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that she loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I don't enjoy that kind of life.
Even when it started and I took it very badly, I once told her that I didn’t want to live and asked what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought, and finally said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists and calling on the government and the local Muslim minority to help.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion," Valls said.
He wants to ensure that only the spiritual educated in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where jihadist-indoctrinated preachers often come with money.
By October, Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, it was supposed to help make the financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction more transparent.
However, it was soon struck by internal contradictions and never worked properly.
“It’s a total failure,” Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Interior and Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chev?nement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
France has some 2,500 mosques and mosques, about 120 of them serving radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clerics from the country and are considering the move for several more dozen.
This week, German police also intervened against the jihadist clerics.
The Imams are said to have recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January 2015, a debate erupted in France over a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All this has been accelerated by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks: to provide funding for mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
However, it is not yet clear where it will get its funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, i.e. mainly meat coming from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food sellers for the provision of permits.
Some of the money will go to the foundation’s budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, some 30,000 people travel to Saudi Arabia on a traditional pilgrimage.
Moreover, only preachers who have gone through educational programs at French universities should operate in French mosques.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government is also closing down radical mosques.
"Since December, we have closed 20 and others will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown gunman Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Zaragoza, reports the Independent.
The shooting occurred after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car outside the shopping center, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, an ambulance had to come for the man in critical condition.
The incident occurred around 11 a.m. in the central part of the capital of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Rolls with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes light, well-digested food, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our head.
And so the summer gardens smell of grilled necks, brisket, pork knuckles.
Not very healthy, not very light, sometimes with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
True, the barbecue is time-saving and dishes, moreover, it is a social matter and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make a good delicacy that will make dining special, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook anything for a long time, bake, fry or stew.
They will also contribute to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where high-quality ingredients and a few well-chosen griffins are enough to make the preparation itself a real exotic treat.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
There is even less time cooking and cooling of rice.
Paper can only be softened into water for a moment and then depends only on the imagination of the cook, how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
There's no algae like algae.
The advantage of many dishes of Asian cuisine today is that the raw materials are usually already available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic snacks accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the real pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several types of vinegar and ginger.
Just buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the attachment with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures to serve and decorate meals during various ceremonial occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are widespread in a number of countries in Asia and South America as a "tool" for the preparation of various baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packaged in them in a similar way to aluminum foil.
The banana leaf then imparts a specific flavor to the dish.
They can be bought in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
However, choose only leaves rich green, and therefore healthy - uncracked and without stains.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare salad from wakame algae, sesame and sesame oil.
You can buy it frozen again.
Anyone who eats or prepares sushi will probably know about nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed, from which it is made by chopping, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves, ie plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame, a dark green algae growing in the waters around Hokkaido Island, is also eaten fresh and dried and is as popular as nori.
By the way, who does not know miso soup with wakame, allegedly, Asian women have used it since ancient times to recover after childbirth.
And in general, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents graying hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and crushed wakame also serves as a spice, for example, to flavor rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to infuse in water, then rinsed, put in boiling water and boil for half a minute.
They are then cooled in ice water, cut out the central ribs and continue to be prepared, for example, as a favorite salad.
However, buying it ready-made, frozen is the easiest solution.
All that remains is to twist the roll with a light vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavours.
It's like a longevity bomb.
If you resist and do not throw in extra grilled brisket.
Eat healthy, light and summery.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that deliciously combines flavors.
And it's done in one or two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green asparagus, 60 g of salad cucumber, 60 g of wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chili sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First, prepare the rolls.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, boil the asparagus sprouts briefly in hot water, let them cool down quickly in ice water after about three minutes so that they do not lose color.
Put the filling of vegetables on the allowed paper and wrap.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chilli sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
Place the asparagus sprouts on a banana leaf, add the rolls and decorate the whole dish with a wakame algae, pickled ginger, a slice of mango, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in sevens rugby, Fiji pick takes gold
Great Britain's impressive sevens rugby performance ended in a devastating hitch on the last hurdle, with Fiji beating the British in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians gave a masterful lesson in processing, landfill, dodges, support play, line running, and brute force - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unprecedented consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - the third for Britain on any given day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic Sevens Rugby Tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The South Africans won 7-5 in the semi-finals the same day, possibly freezing them out in the final.
However, Fiji would also beat the 15-member team in full health in its form.
It may not be a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the head coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former head of England at Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one.
This defeat hurts, but the progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, the penetration of the British reflected for joy.
For captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates it was like running behind a row of buses in motion and the World Cup champions were leading 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring a third time, but only Fijians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa threw a Veremalua touchdown in the right corner and the British were losing 17-0.
Nakarawa added another after returning, and there was still more than one minute left on the clock... of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated through the languid British and rushed onto the line where he scored.
Conversion to 29:0 was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji had been born for rugby 7s while the British were still learning the passing.
That's exactly how it is.
The British made mass changes after half-time and stopped the Fijians' onslaught... for the entire long four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after the brilliant interlude of Fiji by Josua Tuisov penetrated further.
Dan Norton tried to get the opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown in the left corner to raise an 36: 7. But the game had long since been won by the people of the Pacific Islands, and their fans sang on the stands, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the completely joyful attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the Fijian victory with another attempt.
There was a whistle, the Fijians embraced, and the British fell on the grass completely subdued.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, and the United Kingdom defeated South Africa in the close semi-final by a margin of one conversion.
Kyle Brown put the South Africans in the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
The great late dump of Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of England's 15th team, secured the win - and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win rowing race inspired coach's fight with cancer
You won't find more emotional gold in these Games - and that's something to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing breaths into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two oars, there were three voices in the boat. As the boat whizzed across the water towards the second Olympic gold in a row in the women's doubles race, the voice of the still-present coach Robin Williams was still in the boat with them. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see - two outstanding female athletes flying over the water with swans elegance - does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
For every gold medal in rowing, there's a battalion of helping hands that make a difference piece by piece, and no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago didn't know if he'd live to see that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
In his words, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer that can be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It will change your perspective a bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The lucky thing for the whole trio was that they could start treatment in early 2014, out of season, and thus reduce the blackout to a minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get back together fast.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were of Williams, who was very nervous this morning, speaking less than usual as he tried to manage his own uneasiness.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, which has had a mission in Afghanistan, said: "I've been down with emotions this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
Again, it highlights how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked together, and Robin did too.
Up until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anyone, so he deserves a huge thank you, he’s the best coach in the world.
I could not have asked for a better coach or coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a single race in five years.
The pair set a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn’t match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We focused as much as possible at the time.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It is really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn’t want to achieve something great.
We weren’t looking forward to the fireworks tonight, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The pair will take a year to decide what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, with Steve Backshall as her date.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it would be my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to find out that I was the Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
“I have a much better feeling about this,” she said.

Prison?
Rather, let him drive people for free, says Rubeš, a hunter of the taxi mafia, to the ground-breaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former municipal official in Prague are, according to Czech Television, the defendants.
You have made a number of reports in which you have exposed fraudulent practices and those who are to be in the group that will stand trial.
Because of this, you have faced several unpleasant skirmishes with exposed actors.
How bad is the indictment of the members of the organized group?
I thought there might be a trial.
I'm mainly curious about the verdict.
I don’t think they should be in jail.
It's no use.
They should give back all the money they have stolen.
And they should return them so that they will drive all the people for free.
This is a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean that the punishment is not effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so afraid that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes pingles, another delivers pizzas, and one completely bails on it.
The defendants can theoretically be sentenced to two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that’s an adequate rate?
I generally have a problem with imprisonment.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in this case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the company they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they have been doing this by destroying the name of our country and by profaning people.
So let them do a good card now and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a community service.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get parole eventually and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and subsequently at Tomas Bata University in Zlín.
It is one of the people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programmes, and is currently preparing the Prague Guide programme, which is primarily aimed at foreign viewers.
Rubeš advises them in the form of short reports, which services they prefer to avoid in Prague and which services they recommend to use without fear.
He has previously filmed a series with the titles How To, City of Deception?, Living in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The prosecution refers to them as an organized group.
Police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from The Godfather.
They're more like mobsters - juniors, but they're definitely organized.
They are guarding each other’s taxis.
Prague is completely divided.
I observed that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
Everyone is just looking out for their place, and each group is organized somehow.
It seems to be a complex network.
The defendants include seven people, six taxi drivers, and a former municipal official who warned the driver against checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
What percentage of Prague swindlers in the taxi service, according to your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst people on the street are still there.
I’m talking, for example, about Aleš Ryáček.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by Charles Bridge and drives people.
The last time I drove with him, he asked me for seven hundred in three kilometers.
The police did not arrest him for some reason.
They only picked a few people from the whole big group.
The same is true in other places in Prague.
Thus, the prosecution of seven people will hardly eradicate the already famous Prague mischief, which apparently has much larger dimensions.
It's no use at all, of course.
It will help, but all evil is not eradicated, it is true.
Do the taxi drivers who steal from foreign tourists still perform in the same places you have shown in the reports, i.e. at Charles Bridge or on Pařížská Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day and violate the ordinances every day.
It is ignored by both the municipal police and the Prague City Hall.
It is no longer a cat, but a complete indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
However, some of them, even if they are only part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel that it is a little better, I will continue to do so.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if there's one thief left, we should still be doing something to remove him.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But that’s not the case, there are more of them.
Are you still trying to confront them in taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say that it’s still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometres, although he then claimed that it was CZK 56 (he used a trick with a decimal point).
He had a receipt for it, the cops came, and this cab driver was so cutely rude that he still went to the cops and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver glued the decimal point on the taximeter and robbed tourists of 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the insolence of fraudulent taxi drivers has not subsided even after you showed the faces of those in your shots who charged senseless amounts for a short ride?
Their insolence is still unbelievable.
What happened to the taxi driver asking for 56 crowns?
The police sent him away, saying they could not discuss with him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And I think that will be a problem even in this court (six taxi drivers and one ex-officer).
On one side there will be a taxi driver with his bills, on the other side there will be the police.
However, according to the Supreme Administrative Court, the Magistrate is not allowed to use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming parts about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves brought this precedent to my attention.
I've only ever wanted to use the footage for a story.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them from the courts?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver could ride for six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he would not make a living.
You talked about a trick with a decimal point, which is shifted especially in front of foreign clients by underwater taxi drivers.
Is it still relevant, or are they afraid to continue using this trick after your reports have been published?
I think we've popularized this trick by airing the show.
I was driving a cab driver the other day, bragging to me that he was the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed that from the side of the taximeter stuck black cardboard.
When I asked him what it had in it, he said to me, "You know what it is."
If the fines did not work too well for the fraudsters, can the court with their colleagues warn them?
Is there anything that can stop them from cheating?
You said they always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can deter them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair-traded taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague fortunately prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack the skill.
They don’t know how to walk and they can’t say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (due to a proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it did not sound very clear what they wanted.
They once said they didn’t protest against Uber, they just wanted the same conditions as the service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they had just blocked Prague and it turned out to be only the best possible advertising for Uber.
Overall, how do you assess the approach of the Prague City Hall in solving the problem of overcharging fares?
It is obvious that the criminal police had to step in to solve something.
The Magistrate was too short.
They had a mole that was leaking information, which means the taxi department was doing their job for years for nothing.
I'm hoping they'll charge the clerk for every last check he's made to realize what he's done.
I think that's the worst part.
I even went with him on one inspection trip, which I only found out later from their schedule.
It’s been several months since the last series was published.
What's the response?
I think especially with foreign viewers, which series is most focused on.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I show them these videos.
And then when we walk along the Old Town Square, they are surprised that the same people who can be seen in the footage are really standing there.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd build a fence around them for people to look at.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need to?
Right.
I travel with services where I do not have to pay in cash, but by card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also a lot of dispatchers that are fair.
I've only taken a taxi on the street once since.
When the driver got into the car, he said, "Well, you've got some guts."
Dressed as an Italian tourist.
The practice of taxi drivers was first reported in 2005.
In the same year, former mayor Pavel Bém went on a check-in ride dressed as an Italian tourist and on the first attempt, the driver cheated him by two hundred.
Rubes, however, had a worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him CZK 820 for the ride from Old Town to Wenceslas Square, which costs about CZK 195 per kilometre, as calculated by the authors of the reports.
The Prague City Hall has set a maximum price of CZK 28 per kilometre.
The footage also includes other surprising sums: for example, a two-kilometre journey from Pařížská Street to Truhlářská Street cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge also provided expensive rides.
For a ride to Anděl, which is 2.5 kilometers, they may charge six hundred crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
Impurities come out of it well, although sometimes dirt must be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be pulled out of the folds.
It is not easy and it is not quick, the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov in Háje has explained her work.
Hat down in front of her: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb and climb again countless times.
"The restorer should be careful, patient and undemanding to the work environment," she said.
This is far from her first restoration work in Frýdlant.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back tract of the Frýdlant town hall were restored, as well as statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Piet in Frýdlant’s Okružní Street, Marian Column in Frýdlant or atlanta in the front of the spa in New Town under Smrkem.
The restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Kryštof and Kateřina z Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; either they will anchor to the wall or to each other.
They are also waiting for treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb are gold again.
"Then the gilding of the inscriptions on the marble slabs will begin with pure gold leaf," said Věra Sobotová, the official of the State Monument Care of the Municipal Authority in Frýdlant.
There is no record of the tomb having undergone any repairs.
On closer inspection, they will take holes drilled in marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of a tombstone.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
They literally brushed off the tombstone, Saturday noted.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross there are restorers with a slight exaggeration at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombstones that were under water, the baptismal font was restored, the wall paintings in the tomb and now the tombstone.
"We would also like to go into the stained glass in the future," said Sobotová.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, we put money into maintenance and repairs every year.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Redernov tombstone will cost a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They will be paid from subsidies, the city will not put any of its money into this part of the recovery.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from winning the regional round of the Historic City of the Year 2015 competition, while the remaining 28 thousand crowns will come from the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, Mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer said.
The decision to release the winnings for the restoration of the tombstone was made by the council.
Experts’ opinions on the future development in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) within the horizon of one month and a half years.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have guessed at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which underwent 12% correction in February, is now at a new all-time high, with a 7% increase since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that long-term traders should never go against the interest of central banks, which have always achieved their goals.
With U.S. equities at an all-time high, volatility is now at its lowest since 2014, with markets growing happily and fearlessly thanks to the U.S. central bank’s quantitative easing, and with the Volatility Index (VIX) holding steadily below 12 percent today.
I wish I hadn't.
While the Fed continues to prepare for gradual interest-rate hikes, quantitative easing in both Europe and Japan is well under way, and last week the Bank of England, which will buy 70 billion pounds of bonds over the next six months, also joined in.
Thus, a new wave of quantitative easing pushes already low yields even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That, of course, is the million dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilising, and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if the US stocks remain in a similarly calm regime.
It's a pity that Juncker isn't studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has taken on this important and demanding task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, when he appointed a French politician (really experienced, because so many different supranational political positions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to find) as the main negotiator of the European Commission’s terms of departure of the United Kingdom from the EU.
Juncker’s choice has blown away hints of hope that it is in the EU’s serious interest to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most of the British media have adopted the name of Barnier as an act of war by Juncker.
Barnier is a rock European Federalist.
They hate Britain.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He conceived it as only he could: the obstinate enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
A proponent of multilateral regulation, he co-authored the concept of a so-called banking union and, with a grudge against everything that comes from the City of London’s financial centre, pushed through legislation exorbitantly harsh regulations on the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, adamant and probably ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how can we not remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance sheet, overview and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much?
That is why Czechs and Slovaks can be close friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this respect.
It would be for the good of everyone!
The earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin released his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday fired Sergey Ivanov from his post as president.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
This was reported by Russian media, citing the press service of the Kremlin.
Putin has said he will release Ivanov at his own request.
At the meeting, which was broadcast on Rossiya 24, the president said he met Ivanov's wishes when he took office, saying he wanted to be the president's chief of staff for no more than four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The news of the exchange at the head of the president's administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's current representative Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, has been described as one of Putin’s closest collaborators.
This former KGB officer, for example, has previously held the positions of Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will also be stepping down as a member of the President’s Security Council.
Ivanov, however, told Putin that the length of his stay at the head of the administration of the head of the state is actually a record holder.
He stayed there for four years and eight months.
In the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have been replaced in this capacity.
Neither Kvitová nor Deblistky Strýcová and Šafářová will play the final.
So far, none of Friday's tennis matches have been able to turn into a final.
Petra Kvitová was the first to lose her fight, succumbing to Puerto Rican surprise Monica Puig after sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, Kvitová was followed by Czech deblists Šafářová and Strýcová.
The Williams sisters were defeated in the first set, but lost two sets, and the Russians eventually captured the set in a shortened game.
The second set then lost by a ratio of 4:6.
Half success in the morning program in Rio recorded Czech rowing: skipper Ondřej Synek won his semi-finals with an overview, defeating the second Damir Martin from Croatia despite slowing down in the end by almost a second.
Today was good, conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, my son said.
It was his opponents who, unlike him, had to fight for the procedure.
So it took some strength away from them, that could make it easier tomorrow.
But I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, it’s just playing into my hands, said the rower of Prague’s Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková, however, did not follow in Snyk’s footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower took fourth place in today’s semi-finals and is due to start in the B final and fight for 7th to 12th place on Saturday.
Gold from London won't stand for it.
This is the first time I have not been to the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand I did a good race and I gave everything I could.
The contestants were simply better, Topinková Knapková bowed in front of them.
She fought to the end, believing she would make it to her fourth games among the elite six.
She gave up the fight just before the finish.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could step up from that field.
I was surprised that the Chinese had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it to the final through Austrian.
Unfortunately, today was the race of a lifetime, said the 2011 World Champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who failed not even for the second time to get out of the qualification, this time small marks lying.
In it, Nepejchal took the 33rd place.
Qualifying was best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky advanced from the first place with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigoryan (628,9).
Nepejchal's shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes spoke for the first time in Rio, including Czech seven-fighters Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachová ranks eleventh after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, the Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is twenty-two.
She is led by Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as well as Nafissatou Thiam, another Belgian.
They both scored the best performance in the seven-game history.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who is worse?
Apart from the absurdity of the question thus posed: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, while Russian has not.
In both great Eurasian nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century, and regimes came to power that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism listed in the Black Book of Communism, whether they were daily individual repressions, targeted famines, incompetent warfare, or inhumane experiments.
The Nazis exterminated about 6 million Jews in an inhumane manner, and the total victims of World War II are estimated to be 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, atrocities were carried out by the Germans and the Soviets.
In neither Germany nor the USSR, only a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively, or simply through cowardice or by sticking its head in the sand.
This is not just the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came with denazification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
As the children grew up, they began to ask: “Daddy, grandfather, why did you participate in such atrocities?”
How could you!
This has brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don’t want to re-attach Alsace-Lorraine or someone - to revanch - to militarily attack - everyone will recognize that.
After losing the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive change finally closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB (sic!) officer Vladimir Putin came to power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin's Russia is to revanch, conquer lost territories, humiliate the West.
The health, prosperity and future of our own people is of no value to Věchuška.
Beat your own, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only by the decades of a despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - predestined to Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from rising tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated.
Who benefits from rising tension?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia deteriorated again.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side became the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both sides are contradictory and difficult to independently verify, so we can only think about the old, familiar question: Who benefits from this?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
The information about the arrest of Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia has already come from the case of the pilot Savchenko, a known response that they were allegedly kidnapped on the territory of Russia.
If we were to accept the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
Escalating tensions around Crimea can only hurt Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further toughening of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the past year, the migration crisis in Europe has led to a shift in focus away from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has lost all credit in front of its citizens, with current support for President Poroshenko at around 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have gone bankrupt a long time ago had it not been for generous financial injections by the EU and, above all, the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime once again needs to vigorously draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation in front of the voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces once again want to prove themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
We can only hope that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their huge responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both sides of the conflict and stop their hostilities in time.
Bulgaria reports inflation for first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, as measured by the CPI, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 vs. December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 vs. July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in travel of the following groups of consumer goods in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), and health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
U.S. intelligence officials have been monitoring Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks became public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was dealing with an attack on the servers of the Democratic Party headquarters.
There is no official report on Russia’s involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied involvement in the attack.
The report of the alleged Russian attack was top secret, because its disclosure would reveal that US intelligence agencies are monitoring the hacking and could reveal how they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence agencies were involved in the attack.
New Cybersecurity Advisory Board
The Russian trace tracking material was encrypted and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters reported.
Only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, known as the Eight Gang, has been informed of the public figures.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democratic Speakers in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the Congressional Armed Services and Security Committees.
Acting Democratic Party leader Donna Brazile announced Thursday that she is forming a cybersecurity advisory board to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection for the Democratic Party's servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's suggestion for health problems after consuming the food Salmon smoked - pieces 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016, the Prague hygienists carried out a check in Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na Můstku.
The inspection found that the batch L23012562/T4 with the expiry date 22.11.2016, which the customer pointed out, is no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the expiry date 11.12.2016 was taken.
Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen, and human-eaten live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into internal organs, Šticha said.
We are very sorry for the problems with this brand product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from sale and, for precautionary reasons, we also withdrew all other batches of this item.
The misconduct occurred on the side of the supplier with whom we are negotiating, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, said Albert’s spokesperson Barbora Vanko.
If a customer has purchased this product, they can return it at any of the chain stores and get their money back.
Larvae destroy frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrňata.
Hygienists informed the Prague and Central Bohemian veterinary administration about the occurrence of a dangerous product.
According to news server Bezpecnostfry.cz, people who ingest the parasite may become ill with anisakiosis, which manifests itself in severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease may occur without symptoms, the Czech News Agency reported.
Symptoms occur an hour to two weeks after eating an undercooked infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually leave the digestive tract spontaneously.
Both adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both high and low temperatures, so they are killed either by sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or by freezing.
Veterinarians have also checked salmon at the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had parasites in them.
The shipment of 1,700 products arrived in the Czech Republic at the beginning of April according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS).
To date, 919 packages have been shipped, mostly to the Ahold chain.
SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal told the Czech News Agency on Friday that unsold stocks of the product are currently being withdrawn from stores.
Immediately after positive samples were found, veterinarians banned the sending of other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman wanted to flee Raqqa, apparently killed by a Russian airstrike.
After initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to a jihadist who was soon killed, the sobering came.
The expected paradise of the Caliphate turned into a hell on earth for British girls, from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She called him repeatedly and told him she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They are ordered to shoot without thinking, quotes The Telegraph lawyer Tasnim Akunjee's family.
The last traces led to Raqqa, from there the girl spoke for the last time.
Then came the news of her death, which could not be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
They discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There, they hoped to reunite with the former student.
Kadiza was probably killed before she could flee, as the house she was staying in was razed to the ground by an airstrike in May, British ITV News reported.
TV added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You would take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week she was thinking about escaping from the Islamic State, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and was publicly beaten to death, according to available information.
I think she interpreted it as a warning and decided not to take any risks, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set off on February 17 last year.
All they said at home was that they were going out.
However, they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there via Turkey to the territory controlled by IS.
The lawyer said the girl's family was doing everything in its power to get Kadiza back.
You'd take the blue sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything it could to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive is that Kadiza’s fate can serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
“There are many cases where people went there, they realized how things were there, they understood how different it was from the Islamic State’s propaganda promises, and they wanted to go back,” Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadi's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also paused, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the county centre and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts were held in the town hall, and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts resided were deplorable, and many prisoners attempted to escape.
Many of them also successfully.
That is why the city representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to prisoners, having heating and gas lighting.
It was closed for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, because the smaller correctional facilities were expensive to operate and did not pay much.
Stories of convicts and ghost hunts.
The prison opened to the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different the conditions were.
Guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked up in one of the cells, mostly for a photo in memory, or to evoke the feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
Inveraray Prison is one of Scotland’s most famous haunts.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have already set out there, and to this day the museum allows people to come to hunt some ghosts.
However, such a night will cost 300 pounds, which is about 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
‘Animal’ effect on Snapchat criticized as Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by the animé, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Every day, Snapchat allows about 150 million users to alter reality and toy with identity in ways bordering on absurdity.
You can make a pineapple, a dog, or a character that seems to come out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any errors will be posted immediately.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past, accusing it of promoting blackface or promoting white skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it offered users a filter this week that made their eyes slanted, their teeth crooked, and their faces puffed up, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - a "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated contentious questions point to a larger problem for society - the diversity problem.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and news and outrage quickly spread, and Snapchat said the next day it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a manifestation of accounts to the characters of the animé, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded of painful stereotypes in action.
The others flatly refused to compare themselves to the animé.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least malicious and embarrassing."
She added that "it is difficult to argue against comparing the apparent Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face, but that the yellow face is tightened to a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has gone beyond these cultural boundaries.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Holywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - may mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that’s offensive to some users,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview, “it’s very hard to ignore these things today like it used to be.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Katie Zhu criticized the company's overwhelming white, all-male leadership and ended the article with a hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they don’t have any diversity and people of color between employees at the moment these things are decided,” said Zhu, who is of Chinese-American descent, “or people of color are working there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak out.”
Other observers share her view - a complaint left largely unanswered by Snapchat.
The company does not publish figures regarding the diversity of its employees, with the fact that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to talk about the racial origins of its employees, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter who should focus on underrepresented populations and internal management of inclusion.
Zhu adds, “I wonder if they really need other users who can say it’s not okay,” with the account being shut down.
Military Officers Misrepresent Intelligence on ISIS, Says Parliamentary Committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report released Thursday that officers from the U.S. Central Command were changing intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events from the country provided.
According to a preliminary report by a task force assembled by the Republican chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Subcommittee, there has been “extensive dissatisfaction” among central intelligence analysts that their superiors have altered their assessment of America’s efforts to defeat ISIS.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military's central hub in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence outputs approved by senior Centcom officers generally offered a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than were corroborated by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.”
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are harmed when a faulty analysis is presented to senior policymakers," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
The failure of Centcom's leadership reaches to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the central staff’s ongoing problems in describing and analyzing U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be amended, the report said analysts felt pressured by Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by ISIS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the central staff’s press releases, statements and statements from Congress were significantly more positive than what the events actually were,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack to take Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"This is very clear after months of investigation," Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican Party representative, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top-ranking U.S. intelligence officials handled the intelligence output of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in order to downplay the dangers of ISIL in Iraq.
Republicans formed a task force after learning of analysts' concerns that intelligence information related to the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released on Thursday must be followed by further investigation.
There is yet another investigation in Centcom's intelligence services led by the Department of Defense Inspector General.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which matched some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling assessments of information about IS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the committee and a representative of the Democrats.
In the words of Adam Schiff, the process “led to a distortion of intelligence output,” damaged morale among analysts, and “didn’t adequately address dissenting views.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions based on “the bill or the political situation.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon inspector general that was launched after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report as the inspector general's investigation is still ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these crucial national security issues.”
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (a statement now being claimed by a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year’s accusations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can count on the Central Staff’s honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis locations.
Criticism of news coverage of the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than a decade, with Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker writing a research paper stating that President George W. Bush's administration, despite objections from many analysts, defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in opposing the Islamic State's intelligence services.
Last year, authorities said Hooker’s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the terrorist group’s financial resources as the group built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been handed over outside the central headquarters.
The Centcom commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism the past year after many lawmakers found Senate testimony too positive a war assessment.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
USA won field hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will be the decisive match in the team Great Britain
Katie Bam scored three wickets in a 6-1 win against Japan, and just a day later, she scored the first two wickets of the game for the U.S. women's field hockey team, in which America beat India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five wickets in two matches is a success worth remembering, but Bam (27) said she wasn't sure she'd ever managed anything like this.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I'm not one of those people who writes down their goals.
But he knows this: The Americans are leading 4-0 at the Olympics, sharing first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained undefeated on Thursday after Japan’s 2-0 defeat.
The United Kingdom and the United States will face off on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals, and the match will decide who from the group of six teams finishes in first and who in second place.
The team from the first place avoids the strong Danes who are at the head of the second group for a little longer.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday’s game, the Americans caused a stir four years after finishing in the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest ever player.
The 2008 Olympics eluded her because she did not make the final roster.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team were doing very well.
The following year, Craig Parnham was appointed head coach and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
In London, we didn’t have the pace we have today.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half by scoring a goal with a bekend from nearby.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then clicked through to the center and scored the ball into the goal to get the American women into the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last wicket in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The goaltender Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three wins, was the first woman to win the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen Trampoline in the Midst of the Olympic Rage
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro make one feel persistent, indescribable, and preoccupied with the alternation of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a hot baton that is passed from the archer to the swimmer, gymnast and triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with dimples in his cheeks, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names ring out in homes in prime time between ads and sponsor spots if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumping.
The Olympic flame is not the same in all competitions.
Far from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not universally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably reign for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw your attention to the unobtrusive charm of the trampoline.
Although jumping on a trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first introduced at the Sydney Games, it remains almost unnoticed after 16 years of intervention - many people I interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. has never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012, none of the athletes made it to the finals.
Men’s awards are usually split between China and Russia, and women’s awards are split between China and Canada.
This year’s gold medals will be held in London by China’s Dong Dong and Canada’s Rosie MacLennan.
But the jumps on the trampoline have yet another misfortune, partly because the ear of the uninitiated will seem more suited to clown university than to the Olympics.
I must confess that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has comic potential - comic vibes of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines.
The word “trampoline” is derived from the Spanish “el trampoline” which means “jump board.”
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them to a height of almost 10 meters and perform kits with several elements (salta, screws and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated by execution, difficulty and "time in the air".
32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is ahead.
Gold medalists must go further, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, other times back and forth, up and down.
He is trying to catch up not only with the finish line or the starting wall, but, as TV news reports, also with another imaginary line: a world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a bit fanatical - and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a little bit exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on a trampoline brings relief in this regard.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a weightless state like astronauts, flying upwards, then downwards, and then again effortlessly upwards.
Without competition and, of course, difficulty, but for the duration of the assembly there is no fierce struggle to reach the goal, no distance measurement, but only perfect, graceful suspension of time and gravity.
This is the closest the Olympics and Zen will come.
The women's qualification and finals are held on Friday afternoons, at 13:00 Eastern Time, and the men's competition is held on Saturdays at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block that starts on both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise peaceful, pleasant moments that you will probably overlook in spite of other fights.
And if attention is to be gained only by making male athletes the object of love looks and materialization - as recently suggested by US gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to gasp.
The “Protesting Generation” in Ethiopia, America’s Longtime Ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have encountered violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during clashes with police.
Is there a threat of war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government unrest has gripped the country, spreading to more and more areas.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses say officers shot and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
The videos of the protests, which are believed to be from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show security forces beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand against a wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It’s always been difficult to keep this country together, and it’s going to be even harder to move forward,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the danger of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few, if any, African countries are receiving such aid from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new suburban train running in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be called a model of democracy - human rights organizations talk about government repression without ceasing - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, the dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
However, this can change.
“If you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the youth.
A whole generation is protesting.
There are many complaints about everything from land disputes to absolute control of the ruling coalition.
After last year's election, which was widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now control 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, there is increasing pressure on the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this imprecisely marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitists fear that separatist groups that have been more or less repressed in recent years, such as the Orom Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to exploit the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of smoldering beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have flared up again.
The first is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can only communicate via social networks in the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become widely available and the provision of internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly done especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians have spoken out about how they rallied in protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromo and the Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian hills of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade, and took advantage of the Oromis, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
“We are on the path to a united leadership,” said Mulatu Gemechu, the Oromo leader.
The largest protests took place in areas inhabited by the Amhara and Orom.
Many Amharic and Oromians believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls military, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an undisclosed illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled at detecting early signs of discontent, and used envoys to process opponents and win them over to his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative obscurity in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts described as an election that the government botched and then stole.
A crackdown followed, during which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual escalation of disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped this.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked business firms owned by Tigers, and resentment against Tigers on social media is becoming more common.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently stated that the base has been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to crumble in an already volatile region.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump Explains His Statement on Obama and ISIS Funding as “Sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday attempted to downplay the latest controversy flooding his campaign by saying he didn’t mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terror group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an awkward position, who have been trying hard to defend him in the stormy times and must explain that he may not have meant his remarks.
After the motion at the meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really had no intention of saying that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
In a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was being sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the claim of just one day ago, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Obama was bent on destroying ISIS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes as Trump has attempted to focus his campaign on the economy, while his polling preferences are falling.
Trump and Clinton are dueling in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on the subject.
On Twitter, he once again warned that Clinton’s proposals were linked to tax increases, saying that she thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm to defend himself.
At the end of July, when he received a wave of criticism when he suggested that the Russians should break into Clinton’s emails, he would later explain his remark by saying, “I’m sarcastic, of course.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and moderate them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing the extent to which some messages have a response from his supporters to see how they react, and then, according to the response, he "put in an explanation," said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language both candidates used.
But I also think that he is skilful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be explained differently.
As poll results continue to decline in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more poignant tone in recent days, instead of simmering things down for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed Tump is well behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump tries to avoid making excuses for the provocative statements he makes, but often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces heightened scrutiny in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his devoted supporters, no matter how provocative, in an awkward position.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is justified political commentary,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that he mistakenly called a newcomer, and it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to flourish and fail to manage the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Prior to Friday’s rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to rain fire on the media on Twitter for overthinking his every word and being biased against him.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” TV scholars who try to understand him and said, “They can’t!”
Several Democrats sneered at Trump’s apology, saying it was just further proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
The café has been pushed out of the market by prices. Now it is returning to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed from the front of the Bedford Avenue house.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a sprawling city.
Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is being ransacked and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a reinvention.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original site.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is also good.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and CEO of the new site.
In Verb began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, 36, left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even reused the lighting from the old Verb.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
On offer are sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings such as capers and fried onion.
There are also brown rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of the original regulars.
"Many of the original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices," he said.
Last Sunday, one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir, was here.
Mrs Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and frequented the Verb Cafe.
She even ran out when the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee altogether for some time.
“I found out that what I like is the coffee and the culture in Verbo,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she gave herself a mixed chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
He goes before work and orders the same thing every time.
“At quarter and eight every day, like clockwork, I come and they’re already preparing my bun with everything and butter for me,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually orders, but occasionally he gets bacon, eggs and ham on his bun with everything.
Rodriguez said he was not sorry that the soap business had taken his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
“I think we could still use it,” Rodriguez said.
Also, the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint received the cafe well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to display it soon so that his new neighbors would feel at home.
The new place has even more advantages.
A local fruit juice maker wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
It is possible for the cafe to expand into the neighboring building.
For many customers, it’s enough to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he was said to have broken his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop reopened, coming in and having coffee was like coming home.
“I missed the smell,” he said.
Depressed food from a time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
The gourmet President Roosevelt enjoyed selected dishes from 5th Avenue, such as goose liver pate and Maryland tortoise soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: devil-like eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree, and plum pudding for dessert.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe’s last book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane tells the life story of a house on the Lower East Side through food in her book 97 Orchard.
Their new work, A Square Meal, will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They themselves showed culinary solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small austere buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which the couple said was perfect for talking about food during a crisis.
"The burgers were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
It sold peanut, liver, and bean burgers.
They were made from the ingredients and other cheap foods that set the ingredients.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grinned.
"They would be lying in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for the farm workers, and a freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. “A Square Meal” observes the ways in which the nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of plenty.
“It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious dishes such as meatballs and casserole dishes, casseroles as a "wonderful way to use up leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide unaesthetic ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - the focal point of American food for years - has become an economical luxury.
The strange blends, which were supposed to serve as a caloric and nutritional filling, took precedence over taste or even common sense when cooking.
During surveys for a book that contains recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the evening table," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman said, “It was surreal.”
Peanut butter and roasted onions don't go together.
It was typical of a lot of homemade recipes.
As never before and never since, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - have governed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take over the reins of the budget, and turned tassels such as cream spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, desserts were created in the government’s response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “I’ll have a pie” pose.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his childhood, he dined as the select millionaire he became.
“He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce,” said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him lead by example with his own stomach.
As the book narrates, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in the taste. This resulted in the White House “not only being served almost the bleakest dish in all of Washington, but also being prepared in the most dismal way.”
Many of the food habits of the crisis subsided as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy has remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say they had a better understanding of Miss Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits while writing the book, such as why she couldn’t throw away the food.
“She was really worried about wasting food,” Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman said, “People were sick of her.”
There's been an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg's tables were clear, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had made at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
“It’s called plum cream,” Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly plunged the spoon into a thick brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe joined in, and then again.
And like a good housekeeper, he said to his wife, "You could use a little chopped walnuts."

Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of legal expenses in the case of a type C hepatitis patent against Merck
A district court judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a lawyer's fee payment incurred in the process of filing a type C hepatitis patent against the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was ordered to pay $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents in connection with Gilead’s highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge found Merck’s repeatedly illegal conduct, among other lies under oath, and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to a waiver of fees incurred for representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the next-generation hepatitis C drugs market, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming to be the owners of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead drugs.
US-backed troops claim full control of Manbij
U.S.-backed troops have gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing through the city after the departure of the rest of the group of radicals who were hiding in the city.
The troops freed more than 2,000 civilians held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF and Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it,” he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, stating that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue in that year and paid an actual tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton contributed nearly $5.3 million in tuition fees to the joint fund, and the former Secretary of State admitted $3 million in revenue from Simon & Schuster for her book about her time in the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published tax returns in 10 years.
They paid an actual tax of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be role models for financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped with Clinton’s campaign.
Against this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backs down on his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit of the U.S. Treasury Department as a reason for his refusal to publish tax returns.
"Your move," Hillary Clinton's campaign aide said on Twitter, building on the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audits were completed.
Critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, said his refusal raised questions about his net worth, charitable contributions, business transactions, and various other relationships, including those with Russia.
Clinton has spoken out strongly on the issue, posting a video on Friday reminding how senior Republicans are urging Trump to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, he will address the issue in a speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said in front of people.
Politico said Trump had paid no or very low taxes over the past two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times columnist cited a number of tax advisers and accountants as saying it may still be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure everyone who makes more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, Buffett called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been audited by the IRS and that Trump was "not afraid" of the tax office, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign published tax returns retroactively until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, she only earns $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported income in dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms Filled with Chilli or Fireworks to Protect Elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox method to prevent elephants from going to human dwellings - throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the US environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, is promoting the practice and training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania to use this four-step, non-violent procedure to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them had previously used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they developed this ... toolkit, we’ve seen a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
The first and second step is to light up the passing elephant with a flashlight and start the horn.
If this does not deter him, the so-called “chili cloud” will be thrown away.
The chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped together with a firecracker in a condom, its end is knotted so that only a wick can see from it.
Once the condom is released, it explodes and a fine powder of chili powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually one blow is enough and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to set off the fireworks, which will cause a loud, clear explosion.
A Jewish director leaned into a Berlin hotel for removing the code to call Israel at the “request” of Arabs - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not include a code for calling Israel, according to an employee based on a “demand” by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the code list for a hotel call.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling Israel via its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and contacted the hotel reception with a problem.
The response he received, Lanzmann said, was "shocked".
The hotel official replied that the measure was "decided at the discretion of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this move made the director even more upset.
“Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that Israel’s calling code be deleted,” Lanzmann said.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "great embarrassment".
We were shocked and appalled by the events.
This in itself is a great shame.
The fact that such a thing happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is even more shameful.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event sparked a strong online response, with people calling it a scandal.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel has simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," another post said, pointing out that the hotel, located in the posh Kurfurstendamm street, is located near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dropped any charges by calling the incident an "overlook" and "apologizing" to Lanzman.
"There has never been a direct order" not to include Israel in the call code list, Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
A student-police clash occurred in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday as students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement attempted to disperse the students, which ended with police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
San Paulo Governor Gerald Alckmin's proposals to save money include the closure of nearly 100 public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators could be seen spraying signs on the wall against interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the country's senate decided to indict her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to Russia’s ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015, reaching $856 million.
Russia’s exports to Iran jumped 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The jump in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of tourists from Iran to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued around 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travel.
For the first time, Iran was among the top 20 countries by the number of tourists coming to Russia.
“We can safely say that the record number of tourists from Iran in Russia last year will be surpassed,” he said.
At the same time, a relatively small number of Russians visit Iran, and the ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
“Personally, I can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition,” he said.
Scotsman Callum Skinner rushes home after Brits win gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome when the VB team trio defended the title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the brake, which took his Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man pleased the legend when he rushed to the finish and stole the victory from the hands of favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships in March, even though Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for specialist opening racer Jamie Staff.
Hindes arrived just in time.
After Hoye's departure, a seat was also vacant, which he attempted to fill in by Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was champion with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but took over the jersey in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind on his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes going for a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes stepped onto the stage, he did not take his eyes off them.
23-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to do my best and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen onto the track after a weak start.
The note was later withdrawn and Britain's rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
There was no such problem this time around.
Hindes said, "With all the British flags in the stands, I felt like I was in London."
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We lost in many world races, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then there are five successful days waiting for us at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny showed, it's not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same Olympics at the same time.
This would then mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, his birthday is also March 23 (this date seems sacred to British sport, on this day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also celebrate birthdays) - a total of six gold and one silver medal.
As much as Hoy got.
Next up, Kenny will take part in a sprint that starts today and lasts for another three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I’m enjoying this one now.
A team race is always the best.
You win with others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be given a knighthood."
That was the only medal race that day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the team's four-kilometre pursuit race.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (22:42) will take place on the second day of the race, which Wiggins will surely focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the commissioners when the referees asked him to measure the height.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on their strong track cycling team to dominate the midterms of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances showing sheer dominance in Beijing and London, expectations declined in the run-up to Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April on charges of sexism and discrimination, and the ending of the careers of greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the velodrome shows, the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing seems to be reaffirmed.
The uncertain future of the Portland smelter after the end of the power supply contract
The future of Portland's aluminum smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain due to the power plant that supplies the business with electricity and which informed one of the owners of the smelter of its intention to terminate the power supply contract. It is expected that all power supply contracts will be cut short.
The move comes after the Victoria state government decided earlier this year not to extend subsidies that keep the business running.
The 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Alcoa Portland may have up to 2,000 jobs at risk.
Up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk if closed.
And because the smelter consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, further avalanche impacts can occur.
Alcoa shut down Point Henry in 2014, leading to the closure of Anglesea last year.
Alcoa's smelting plant in Portland is at risk of being shut down.
The move follows years of speculation about the company’s future, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to factory production prices.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with small business shares held by Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," she said.
The AGL said the contracts were so-called “hedging contracts” that were to enter into force from November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they actually expire in 2017.
“AGL continues to anticipate that the contracts will contribute to earnings for fiscal year 2017,” the plant said.
Any potential impact on AGL profits from fiscal 2018 onwards is currently limited due to the strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts according to its $187 million ledgers "in case the termination should occur."
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contract "does not affect its ... ability to operate a smelter or to secure electricity supplies to the smelter."
The US company said it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect in November this year, though it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL operations manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, who contacted analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian reality TV show - now the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), the model and fourth daughter of clan mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the cover of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder, who performed at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, looking at this front page makes me want to cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover story was followed by a bizarre (or simply continuation of the Kardashians’ humoresque?) staged video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the Rob and Caitly bar brawlers and their favorite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) were all set to leave the stage.
It's the played-out storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of a children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the candour of the cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o'clock in the morning), but somehow Kris needed to make sure the other girls could feed off the publicity.
Because if we look at the September issue of Vogue, we've definitely entered a new era for the Kardashians.
Older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall onto the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
The issue, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (the Fashionista counted that of the 832 pages in last year’s issue, 615 were with advertising content).
The unveiling of the star, which will appear on the front page, is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that in the past two years, images of the magazine have leaked before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more “celebrities that make models” than “models that are celebrities.”
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence made the headlines in 2013, a year later she was honored by Lagy Gaga.
But while it's highly unlikely that Kendall - whom the magazine describes as a "breakthrough model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, nor are they stars of real estate shows, or children of today who know how to make a well-edited video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult due to her participation in a reality show.
Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June, calling them "the sluts of the moment."
These feelings flared again with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this discontent is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue in September.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
He's performing for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she's on a reality show, maybe just one way to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community Legal Aid Centers Reject 160,000 People Per Year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are turned down in community legal aid centres, and in the sector itself, they are preparing for the impact that further funding restrictions will have on services already overexploited.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without the financial means to fight unfair evictions and the like - are refused even as they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already strained to burst, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centers will lose an additional 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of community legal aid centers in Queensland, said that according to the latest summary report by the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers, 5,000 people are turned down each year.
Mr Farrell said that without a reversal of the federal government's decision, the situation would deteriorate.
“Community legal aid centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leading to thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders having to navigate complex legal issues unaided.
We call on Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately prevent this cut in funding so that people get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the state government has fulfilled its commitment to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centers and their client communities, and Palaszczuk’s government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's Campaign Lawsuit After Staff Member Allegedly Aimed Gun
New York: A lawsuit was filed against Donald Trump’s campaign for alleged inaction after they were told that the North Carolina operations director had pointed a gun at a staff member during a jeep drive in February.
The incident was described in a court file handed over Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer of the campaign in the state.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before concluding that "it will not happen".
Principal Earl Phillip "indicated the pistol with his fingers, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the barrel at Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
Bordini, after a complaint with local and regional campaign management, found that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Weapons don't have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused controversy when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and gun owners (as regulated in the U.S. Second Amendment) could intervene if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and can appoint her judges.
The Trump campaign says the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for endangering personal security, unlawful use of violence, and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the report.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local branch of Charlotte News, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services was not answered within a short time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as London was in 2012, when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to both Startford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new teaching jobs for our local communities alone, 40,000 new jobs, and we will put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, there are those who will think that Heathrow’s expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would ridicule ourselves on the world stage.
Doubters were wrong in 2012, and even Heathrow turns out to be wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, grow by 211 billion pounds, and leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has put in place an 11 billion pound infrastructure investment program on time and on budget, starting with the T5 terminal - which has been voted the best terminal in the world five years in a row, to the T2 terminal which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they're ready to deliver a third runway, worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 Games in London were a huge success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow will be one too.
It is time to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and to expand Heathrow, secure trade for the future and leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury for Business Affairs.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in cat and mouse game in ad blocker
Attempts to circumvent advertising-blocking programs have become a cat-and-mouse game for online marketing companies, according to one of the companies programming such software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site that said users could update filters in their program and re-block ads on the social network.
Facebook said Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to determine which parts of the page are ad.
Adblock is now claiming to have bypassed the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of war between the open source ad blocking community and those trying to get around them has been going on since ad blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with its own fix.
The fact that the company that owns the world’s largest social network got involved in the war only proves how big of a problem advertising blocking has become for the industry.
According to a study conducted by Tker last year, Pagefair and Adobe used ad filters around 200 million people worldwide - almost four times as many as it did in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
A spokesperson said the company is going against desktop ad filters because mobile ad filters for social media and Instagram mobile apps do not work.
Desktop ads are still profitable enough for Facebook to decide to invest in them.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update its ad preferences tool to give people better control over how ads appear to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said it was concerned about Adblock’s new filters because they could also block content on sites unrelated to the ad.
“This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blocking is an insensitive tool, which is why we preferred to focus on building tools like Ad Preferences to give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident in which a woman was run over on a motorway by several cars on Thursday morning, presumably attempting to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the "desperate act" actor was lying in the dark on the road and several cars ran over her.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but according to police, not all have yet been identified. Police are calling on these drivers and everyone else who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" move in a situation like this, Gilles Hofstetter, a lawyer, told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the crash?
The prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases over the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of charges of negligent homicide after knocking down and killing a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
It was said in court that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was driving in a reasonable manner and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident at Morges should report to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a favorite destination of the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to come to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
On Friday, AČCKA Executive Director Kateřina Petříčková said.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival presents the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, due to its high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses," Petříčková said.
According to a survey by the organizers, foreign visitors spend an average of 3,100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are provided with special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clients are very lucrative, they are interested in staying in higher price ranges with a high standard of travel services and spend more than others," Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium will take place this year as part of the festival programme.
Experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China are lecturing on it.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several topics, such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be a traditional parade with allegorical cars on Saturday, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
The parade, which has been attended by thousands of people in recent years, will mark a minute of silence this year in memory of the victims of the June nightclub attack in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly gay.
Pat and Mat are celebrating their 40th birthday.
Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained both small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening series by director Lubomír Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
The creation of this animated series, which is now known to audiences in more than a hundred countries of the world, was inspired by cartoons by the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who invented it for a magazine with two handymen, Mr. Ouholíček and Mr. Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the dramaturge Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimír Jiránek to collaborate and together they created the film Kuťáci.
The characters got their present look with a yellow and red trick and a beanie and a radio station in 1979, when they began to create a series for Slovak Television in the Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then given to handymen in 1985, this time shot directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of them with the help of Beneš’s son Marek.
Currently, there are over ninety episodes with the stories of these handymen, who are never angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and are finally satisfied with their work, as evidenced by the well-known gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theatres, and the characters and other toys featuring Pat and Mat are a hit in every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sports and one of life.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
What are the things people spend the most on at airports?
That's Friday's review from the world's websites.
The first medal from the Olympic Games.
The island nation of Fiji is celebrating its historic success.
The Great Britain team defeated this archipelago in the final of the Olympic rugby sevens tournament.
This is the first time Fiji has won a medal at the Olympics.
It has been sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
A great credit to the success of the coach Fiji.
Ironically, it was Ben Ryan.
The team has been running since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen could be satisfied unlike their compatriots.
"Let's play freely and lightly and see if we can make the biggest game in our history," the coach said before the final.
Fiji has finally taken over, and a small state of 900,000 people is now living an Olympic fairy tale.
This was reported by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and good luck for the little girl.
Two-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without arms and legs for 11 months, has a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
“Mommy, she’s like me,” the two-year-old said, according to ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take her hands and feet off and then sit together without prosthetics.
In less than a year, she was diagnosed with meningitis B, and doctors gave her only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
He's got perspective.
I saw her introduce herself to the other kids with the words “Hi, I’m Harmonie and I don’t have hands,” the mother added.
Look at the joy the doll brought.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
According to CNN, people spend the most on bottled water at airports.
The Hudson's travel essential stores chain has released figures for the past year, summarizing the 10 products that customers most often buy in its airport stores.
The water was the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the top ten.
Ninth place went to a large package of M&M coconut-flavored candy.
Can you guess who is closing the top 10?
As the only one of the above things can not be eaten.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Magazines include US Weekly, In Touch, and The Economist.
Sovereigns of rowing.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond were laughing.
New Zealand rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have dominated the helmsmanless category for seven years and have also confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the disparate pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing competition since 2009.
At the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, they scored their 69th win in a row in Thursday's final.
What makes us different from others?
We're just prettier, Murray joked during the Olympic regatta, when he was supposed to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
To be honest, we do nothing different than others.
We're just training hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a two-foot-and-a-hundred-pound butler, and the academic-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They also have a different nature.
Bond studies and finances, Murray has a charity boxing match.
They also don’t spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's getting in the boat, basically saying we can't lose.
We're just gonna win.
I tend to think about what can go wrong, admitted Bond, who also demonstrated at a press conference that Murray is dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to respond, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
On the water, however, it destroys opponents with calm force.
They are going at their pace, and although they are often not in the lead in the middle of the track, their opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We are racing on a two-kilometer track and we never wanted to go the first kilometer to the finish line.
We're just trying to drive at a pace that no one else can.
“We know what we have to do to win,” said Murray, 34.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the gold four without a helmsman.
It was after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later that they decided to move to the 2nd without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, they probably had the biggest defeat of their career and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was intense.
We did everything the coach told us and didn't ask any questions.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well,” Murray said.
We all want to take us off the throne.
We always have that target on our backs.
“We’re trying to be half a step ahead of everyone,” he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions similar to those on Earth once existed on Venus, whose surface is hot, waterless, and saturated with CO2.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’s low rotational speed can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus may have once boasted a thin Earth-like atmosphere while rotating slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet probably had areas that were drier than Earth’s, but there was once enough water and geographic diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Previously, Venus also used the Sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
“In a simulation of the GISS Venus during slow rotation, it exposes its daytime side to the sun for almost two months at a time,” said Anthony Del Genio, a scientist at GISS.
This heats the surface and creates rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like an umbrella and shield the surface from too much solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled a story of Venus similar to an evolution previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over the course of several billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and water vapor was burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, leaving only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the lethal effect of a greenhouse gas -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Colorado Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing an inability to participate in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move, saying the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have served as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
I have thought long and hard over the summer about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and take it to the next level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations is in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that affect team performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who received Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
“Patrick informed me of his decision today,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with the 2013/2014 Avalanche.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado struggled with Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and had not always made it through the last two years.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the 2015/2016 season, missing five points to earn a second wild card in the Western Conference.
Goaltender Roy, who signed up for the Hall of Fame, has won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on North Sea oil platform resume talks and suspend strike
Top negotiators said strikes over wages for North Sea oil rig workers were suspended while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group sporadically occurred on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to resolve the current disagreements," the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent to protest wage cuts.
The Wood Group cut rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The cut in company rates comes after a 10% cut for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has struck thousands of people off its payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries to modernize its processes - immediately after a mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, an economic situation linked to Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes of the generation leading up to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region's economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some,” he said in a statement.
By comparison, nearly $1.4 billion of investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, while the average over the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rate of star rotation in the Pleiades
The Kepler Space Telescope's latest mission to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the rotation rates of stars from the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at different speeds, and how the rotation time relates to the formation of the planet.
“By comparing our results to other clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching maturity and have formed over 125 million years.
It is now turning the fastest.
In moments of maximum rotation, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rate of rotation slows.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of discernible points on the stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, making pirouettes more slowly than smaller ones.
“In the Pleiades ‘ballet’, we see that the slower-spinning stars are more massive, while the ones that spin the fastest are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing star quality and rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There’s still a lot to learn about how, when, and why the stars slow down their rotation speed, so to speak, “hanging their dancing shoes on a nail.”
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of Pleiades’ rotational speeds in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a Qualifying Agreement Necessary?
If I did not apply, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could move to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without enrolling in specialized education?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy only in a somewhat more distant hospital, but in about six months there could be a vacancy in another one, where I would like to work afterwards.
I don’t know how to deal with this issue, the question continues.
Corresponds to Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with an employer - a hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution regulated by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the recovery of the costs incurred in increasing or deepening the employee’s qualifications.
In the health sector, there is a long-term pressure not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of health workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognition of professional competence and specialized competence for the exercise of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, participation in specialized education is considered to be a deepening of the qualification (not an increase of the qualification).
This means that a qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs amount to at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation or obligation to enroll in specialized education.
The law only lays down the conditions for applying for inclusion in the field of specialized education.
However, according to the law, a doctor is entitled to pursue the profession of a doctor thanks to the completion of the necessary university studies, although under the conditions laid down by law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation in which professional practice completed in another field of specialization can be included in the specialist training of a doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
Theoretically, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the questioner's situation.
However, given that I do not know the specific circumstances of this case, consultation with the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professions) can be recommended, since the Ministry of Health by law provides advisory and consulting services related to the inclusion in and the course of specialized education.
The counseling service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from Syria's Aleppo ask for U.S. intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege and has not used its influence to protect civilians, according to a letter to the White House.
“We do not need tears, compassion, or even prayers; however, we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over East Aleppo to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not encircled again,” the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support an army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will stop strikes every day for three hours in the Aleppo area to allow safe passage for humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 CEST all military activities, air strikes and artillery fire are to be stopped.
UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed the move, but said a two-day ceasefire was needed.
In a letter to Obama, 15 of the 35 doctors working in eastern Aleppo were controlled by rebels.
During the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel death of countless patients, friends, and colleagues.
The world watches and observes how complex Syria is, but does little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like lightly veiled threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors have pointed out.
Doctors said there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria in the past month, 15 of them on hospitals in which they work.
What saddens us the most is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
In the emergency room, young children come to us with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we do not even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when an explosion cut off the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They gasped for air, and then their lives ended - before they could really begin, they recalled.
An army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded the rebel-held eastern part of Aleppo in recent weeks, finding itself without food for more than 200,000 people.
The rebels, who are under constant Russian and Syrian air strikes, managed to break through the encirclement and launch a counter-offensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then added reinforcements in and around the city.
