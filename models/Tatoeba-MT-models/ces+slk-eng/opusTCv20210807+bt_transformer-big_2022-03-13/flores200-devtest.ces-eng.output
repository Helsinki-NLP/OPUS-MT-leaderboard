This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (this theory is already widespread), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, for example, about the color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal’s plumage was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotene-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the issue of feather development in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a very developed sting called a rachis, but have other features - rays and hooks - the researchers concluded that rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that it was not used in flight, but rather for temperature control or demonstration. Scientists assume that even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not juveniles.
Scientists assume that even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, it represents a specimen of plumage of an adult animal, and not a baby's feathers.
A car bomb that exploded near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than 20 other people.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system is clearly determined by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
Based on luminosity and rotation, the Rossby number of the star is determined, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The smaller Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversal.

The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
It warns against the impossibility of guaranteeing that any targeted activity in present-day Iraq will stop sectarian fighting, increasing violence, or sliding into chaos.
The report opens with a plea for open debate and the creation of a consensus in the United States on policy towards the Middle East.
The report is largely critical of almost all aspects of the current executive procedure towards Iraq and requires an immediate change of direction.
The first of his 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year in order to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions and restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was searching for a phenomenon that would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force on Earth and causes the sea level to rise and fall, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo and consists of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered tuberculosis (XDR-TB) extremely drug-resistant in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant is "highly worrying, even alarming, because of its high malignancy."
Dr. Moll thinks that some patients may have caught the virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital health workers.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 infected at one point in South Africa.

Infrared photos show how temperature differences between day and night indicate that they are probably caves.
“They are cooler during the day than the surrounding surface and warmer at night.
Their thermal changes are not as stable as those of the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but this is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) astrogeology team and the University of Northern Arizona, located in Flagstaff.
In France, voting traditionally takes place without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in the cabin and put a pre-printed sheet of paper in the envelope, indicating the candidate they have elected.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the urn and signs the voter's list.
The French electoral law contains a fairly strict codification of the course of elections.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there were no envelopes in them before voting began, and that no envelopes other than those put in by counted and eligible voters have been added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness the whole process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

UN peacekeepers, who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, are blamed for the spread of the disease, which broke out near the force's camp.
According to the lawsuit, the waste from the UN camp was not properly disinfected, allowing the bacteria to enter the tributary of the Artibonite River, which is one of the largest in Haiti.
Before the arrival of troops, Haiti had not encountered the problems associated with this disease since the early 19th century.

Police Director Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the charges were brought to court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house at the time of the car crash, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then moved to Addenbrook Hospital, Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of her son.
She waits in custody for charges and trial, but witness evidence can be devalued as her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice anywhere else in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts viewed the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “journalists seem to walk on thin ice if they post photos of suspects as well.”
The prosecutor’s office, which is in charge of the prosecution, has told reporters that no further information will be provided at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will cover border disputes in which Palestine wants to preserve the borders according to how they were before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered appear to include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a decade after the signing of the treaty, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters were closely supervised by the rangers during the additional pest control study, as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In cooperation with NPSW and NSW Inc (Australian Association of Sports Shooters), qualified volunteers were hired under the auspices of the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of NPWS' conservation of natural heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting received comprehensive security training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission presented Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests have been triggered by election failures, and some have been going on since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and four people to suffer light burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had informed it of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry said it was "really regrettable" that the report had been delayed by Apple.
The earthquake struck in Mariana at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Authority said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead at this time.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were soon released, as were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later replaced the elderly lady because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and launched a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to deal with premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that when the hormone is administered, it accelerates the maturation of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua news agency said government investigators discovered two "black boxes" with flight logs on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died during the night when there were two moons in the sky. Unique, just like herself. She was a strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna was as crazy as I was...maybe even more...I loved her and will miss her...maybe she's somewhere better."
A poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people who disagreed with Australia’s transition to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
As far as extremes are concerned, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle at the Commonwealth Games and in three relays, but due to his objections his eligibility was doubted.
He could not take the medicine needed to overcome the pain, as drugs are prohibited on the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Missouri, discovered the largest known prime on January 25.
The discovery, using various hardware and software, was verified by several people in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of water on earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth has formed since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors “political chatter and indiscretion.”
There is speculation that he will seek a presidential candidacy in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
Compared to ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite technology that allows air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more accurate information.
No extra traffic will be introduced, overground train service will not be built in Wembley, parking and park-and-ride locations are not available on site.
Concerns about the lack of transportation options have increased the chances that the game will have to take place behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species have evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer, due to reproduction between endemic finches, Darwin's medium finches, and immigrant cactus and conic-like finches.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into miniature pieces.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be bent and braided. It can be melted or pressed into slices.
It can be processed to considerable thinness and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was often used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of the chemical. You can make an indicator yourself using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (letter H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been taken (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then make a ball out of them with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will result in a special feeling and it will form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage drainage systems have been found in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths that were frequented by both men and women.
If you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite to make a call.
A satellite in space receives a call and then its signal bounces back down almost immediately.
The satellite was carried into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and the field of view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a large rocket measuring over 100 feet is needed.
The wheel changed the world in an unprecedented way, and the most important thing it did was make transportation easier and faster.
He brought us a train, a car and other means of transport.
Beneath them are medium-sized felines, whose food forms medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are plenty of small cats (including wild domestic cats), whose main part of the diet consists of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the system of ecological niches, that is, each cat has its own tasks that do not allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called packs.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and juveniles.
Females are usually close relatives and represent a large family made up of sisters and daughters.
The lion pack behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly for its prey.
A tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times more force than a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (genus panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a full-necked lion, but rather like a sentence of sharp, screaming words.
Steelfish like to eat small animals. If they have the opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Nearly all animals that hunt ocelot are much smaller than he himself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling them to know which way they moved on the ground.
They can see very well at night thanks to night vision and can move very quietly. Steels hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they come (for example, when they cross a mountain ridge or river or move to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or ways of adaptation to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in a few thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants make their nourishment from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is of plant origin. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of his time, so he had no fears of anything except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set set set set on the top floor, meaning that nothing that crossed his path had a chance to escape.
We don't know for sure, but they might have had a jagged tongue, and their diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe they could have been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water, even a large dinosaur like T. rex was no match for them.
While most of their meals would not be foreign to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast compositions, including wild boar, peacock, snail, and a species of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their food sitting on chairs, while rich men enjoyed having dinner together and lying on their side while eating.
Ancient Roman food could not include food that came to Europe from America or from Asia only in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered their home.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the backyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
In the Nordic sagas, it is written that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Green Land.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there.
Although all countries were part of "Scandinavia", there were many differences between the inhabitants, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie Treasure Hunters, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is on the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known for certain, it is clear that the large parchment document (dimensions 293 x 4 x 241 x 2 inches) was twisted into a roll and stored not long after its creation.
It is therefore likely that the entry was added simply as a tack.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles brought the liberation of northern France, but the south of the country has not yet been liberated.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". It was the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invading forces instead of fighting.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
Civilization is a certain culture, common to a significant large group of people who live and work in mutual cooperation, i.e., together form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin “civilis” which means “civil” and is related to the Latin “civis” which means “citizen” and also “civitas” which means city or city-state and at the same time it defines the size of society in a certain way.
Predecessors of the peoples were city-states. The culture of civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge for several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces and adequate dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress being its only component, falling under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state authorities to enforce laws that often did not cooperate.
It also had no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states, and only then could they be supplemented. The states took the central government lightly, so much so that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and in 2006 Italy won the World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey and F1 races.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
In view of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is sometimes referred to as an “archipelago” in a geographical sense.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when nearby European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan to begin the transformation of the original grain production practices, employing Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1812) took control of the southwest and north coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1995), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Peace Treaty, giving Japan sovereignty over Taiwan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main platforms: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the peak of the analog film era.
They are still in production today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has also been taken over by digital camera sensor formats.
Although it is somewhat confusing, the 35mm format actually has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
So the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio in integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and ridiculed “rule of thirds” is a simple guide that creates a dynamic in the image while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most effective place for the main object is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had gained wealth and power, became the goal of detailed investigation.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the money resources of the church are there for that very purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over 1,000 years. This concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, despite the blockade violating universally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the previous two centuries.
Britain crisscrossed international waters to keep no ships from reaching entire areas of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
As this tactic met with only a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestrained submarine military forces.
During the 1920s, attitudes of pacifism and isolation prevailed among most citizens and nations.
As witnesses to the horror and cruelty of World War I, nations longed to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the U.S. with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison by Charles Batchelor (supervisor from a previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Among each dynasty, there was also an unstable period of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China, when thousands of people died fighting for the throne in the Grand Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, for instead of military ranks based on class belonging, it now depends on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to seek to start a revolution in their own countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside the realm of secular life, often visiting the cave known as "Hira" on a mountain called "Noor" (light) and there contemplating.
The cave itself, which has survived a considerable time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find it, even if it is known to exist. Inside the cave, it is completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but a wonderfully clear sky and a large number of surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen and heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or “Giza Necropolis” in Egypt’s Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created as a tribute to Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "loop up" tag looks like the letter V, and the "loop down" tag looks like a staple or square missing the underside.
At the top, it means you start at the tip and push on the bow, at the bottom, it means you start at the flip-flops (where the hand is holding the bow) and you pull the bow.
As a rule, the upward movement produces a softer sound, while the downward movement is stronger and more penetrating.
You can write your own labels on the sheet in pencil, but keep in mind that printed labels have a musical reason, so they should usually be followed.
Terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Elizabeth of the Philippines, the French were forced by a mob of market women to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage that surrounded the angry crowd and shouted threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of a criminal gang waved the head of the royal guard in front of the dreaded queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States in order to pay a large part of the expenses, with interest on bonds flowing in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the extra surplus-value drawn from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would represent the basic return of American imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which most believe ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology push or technological imperative, or the belief that human destiny is governed by an all-pervading logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has an “influence” on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that when motor cars appear, it will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
But the national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, causing the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism carried a considerable element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geographically formed individuals and over time, customs and cultures related to this geography arose and these, because they were consistent with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion hub of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion hub of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its importance declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the participants in the Crusades brought back valuables, such as silk and spices, which were worth more at home than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the dress was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of this time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Self-sustaining farming is farming done to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic system using seed native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in subsistence farming, which is still happening in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be different in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that make a subculture different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of the subculture often express their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes dress, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the meaning of socialization is drawing on a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, unfortunate accident or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults as they grow up.
Such children are called "wolf" children. Some wolf children were imprisoned for a long time (usually they were imprisoned by their own parents), in some cases they lived abandoned because their parents rejected them because of their severe mental or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma, whereupon they were abandoned or fled.
Others claim to have been raised by animals, while some claim to have lived alone in the wild.
In the complete education of non-human animals, the wild child exhibits almost identical behavior (within the physical possibilities) to the given caring animal, such as his fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Skeleton is not a teaching method, but rather an aid that provides support to those individuals undergoing the acquisition of a new practice, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is a small staple in Microsoft Office.
Virtual constructs are incorporated in the software to analyze, motivate, and explain procedures that could be too demanding for the student himself.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where he or she does not receive proper nutrition, care and education, but such cases exist.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is to provide for all needs that have not been met in the household from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet add another dimension in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivating elements to use the Internet (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "continuing interest" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience responses to websites.
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-communications - facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
Specifically, you can use the correct interpretation of microexpressions to find out if the other person is lying to you.
Oliver Sacks in his article The President's Speech hinted at how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
It even suggests that such powers of interpretation of human behavior can be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and manifested.
Mutations add a new genetic variation, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination will mix in both directions the differences between the two sets within each generation.
For primates with a human-like digestive system, it is difficult to meet the need for amino acids from plant sources available in the open savannah.
And if they don’t, there are serious consequences: growing depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the proteins available in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us as primates to digest if they are not cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a high amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved the protein problem in a way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, as it forces a person to get up and go to the toilet.
The measure of a person’s inner peace corresponds to the opposite measure of tension in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more good life force brings. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only thing preventing us from reaching this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been extended to the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are basically very simple: Kundalini yoga, meditation and the way of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened by the yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The centerpiece of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. Conflicts of system, processes and culture led to the end of the war to the breakdown of cooperation between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted another 40 years and was actually fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already breached, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup forces along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell through almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army formed Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the soldiers invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of the naval fleet was to ensure the ability of the state to transport persons and goods, but at the same time the navy was also to prevent the enemy from transporting his own persons and goods.
One of the most striking recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where Americans tried to move men and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this operation, mainly using submarines.
If the Allies did not succeed, then Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skins.
The domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures and were often guarded by herders, often from among children or adolescents, much like the more well-known shepherds of sheep.
Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the stagecoach roads mostly consisted of parallel planks, they allowed towing horses to reach a higher speed and carry a heavier load than on other roads, which were slightly rougher.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually discovered that the tracks were more efficient if they had a band of iron on their surface.
This became a common phenomenon, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago at the formation of Homo Erectus (meaning human upright).
Their predecessor Australopithecus usually did not walk upright.
Bipeds occur in Australopithecus fossils between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To some extent reduce future suffering, we can live more environmentally friendly lives, join the environmental movement, and even become activists.
In many cases, it is the same as symptomatic treatment. But if we are not only interested in a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problems and get rid of them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have grown due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
Following Congressional adoption on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks further into John Dunlap's printing business.
Overnight, something between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are currently called "Dunlap copies".
The documentary was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The oldest known surviving copies of the document are the so-called Dunlap broadsides, or a total of 25 copies from Dunlap's printer. The original manuscript specimen is not preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don’t think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still a lot of signs on the birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, a 0 or a 1, and these numbers are given as binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
This term is derived from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitization in humans.
Both insidious and bedbugs are cunning, adapting to life in the nest or housing their host.
Around 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis are known across the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples may opt for their child’s adoption plan.
In the case of adoption, biological parents give up their parental rights so that the child's parents can become another couple.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually the guide of most scientific research.
An experiment is a test that is used to deny one or more possible hypotheses, but it is also important for scientific research to ask questions and observe.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were adopted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living beings including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue in the time of the free-running cycle even without the presence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they either tagged DNA in the phago with radioactive phosphorus, or protein in the phago with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether germline cells have been affected.
Only mutations in the germ line of cells can be transmitted to children, and mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-oriented tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of admiring the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the relevant ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people in cars leave small towns, go to work, and in the meantime, others pass them, heading to work to the place from which they themselves have just left.
Everyone participates in this dynamic shuttle service and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, there is rarely a similar level of complaints about water quality or broken bridges.
Why do transport systems raise so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is it something deeper?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to examine the flow of traffic because drivers’ behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range; therefore, traffic usually has some reasonable consistency and can be approximately mathematically illustrated.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly allowed them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings back along the body.
This gives them a greater choice of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
These days, they are the only insects that cannot fold wings, dragonflies, and ewes.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system including the Sun (and even other stars) was moving around the Earth.
That sounds reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second-longest river on Earth, with more than eight times as much water flowing through it as the second-largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at some points it is up to six miles wide.
20% of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main stream is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in either size or technical precision of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the memories of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
The population of the Vatican City is about 800, the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be relatively easily mined even with the use of simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances shaping what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that there are a lot of elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals, but there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions would fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil after its invention has become a good friend of many people.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of new ways of writing, the pencil was pushed to a lower position and by-use.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, so they do not get in touch with the sharpener at all.
One can only marvel at what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fissionable nuclear bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's kind of like driving a heavy cart up a hill, and then by redistributing the atomic nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to disintegrate on gentle or even no contact.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called a crust.
The bark is about 70 km thick on the far side and about 100 km on the far side.
Under the sea it is weaker and under the mountains it is stronger.
There may be more moon seas on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding out what people can relate to or are close to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt during adolescence.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want what they do and what, in their environment, makes them do or not do those things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid theory of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, there is an effort to remain “one of them” (or one of them).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person changes beyond recognition and feels they have to change everything the team does and do it on their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
These actions often result in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as contact points for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of the virtual team is also the presence of the so-called "invisible team" (Larson - LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
An "invisible team" is a management team to which each member is subordinated. An invisible team sets standards for individual members.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for implementing the concepts of a learning organization is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively across the functional components of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be demonstrated.
As a result, a collaborative organization’s process to overcome an obstacle can lead to new innovative processes to serve the customer’s needs.
For an organization to be innovative, its leadership must create an innovative corporate culture, implement knowledge sharing, and implement organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that organizations use to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, narrowing and clarifying this research area.
Scientists in their research support the interrelationship between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and examine brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models to help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong connotation with science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include checking, scheduling and scheduling, ability to respond to customer diagnoses and queries, handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military and is embedded in a number of applications of home computers and video game software.
Excursions are an essential part of any subject. The teacher would often like to take her students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual excursions. Students can look at artifacts from the museum, visit the aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual field trip sharing is also a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the state capital. They redesign the site every year, but the old versions remain online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve students’ written expression, and while their blogging is often marked by sloppy spelling in the beginning, it usually changes the influence of other readers.
Because students are often the most critical readers, blog writers try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also “forces students to have an overview of the world around them”. The need to stimulate audience interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that encourages students to expand their education beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "will enable students to improve their analytical and critical skills; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their attitudes in the context of other texts and formulate their view of the matter in specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, offering a variety of art galleries and museums that show Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and in the north still waiting to discover the beauty of the Muskoka region and others.
All this and much more emphasizes that Ontario is considered by foreigners to be a typical part of Canada.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people are surprised by the following figure about the population: there are more African Americans in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and from the point of view of wildlife, it can be considered a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are attached to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it flourished in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route by sea (Cape Route) from Europe to India.
To the north is the area bounded by the Sahel, to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers report themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (just make sure it does not look too expensive).
Women should keep in mind that because of cultural differences, they may sometimes encounter harassment and that it is not uncommon for a man to follow a woman while walking, grab her hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don’t justify it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, leaving it after the 1755 earthquake.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city into Daru l-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trade bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of trinkets, but all this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any out-of-town visits should be well thought out in light of the current state of the fighting that continues to take place in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers one of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
For a trip around Goma you can use boda boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal price for a short ride is about 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, “Timbuktu” came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Timbuktu is a poor city today, but due to its reputation it is a tourist attraction. It also has its own airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS show Wonders of the African World, which was accompanied by Henry Luis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it acts more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all National Parks of South Africa, there is a fee to pay for entry to the park and a contribution to nature conservation.
A Wild Card can also be beneficial, allowing access to either selected parks in South Africa or all of South Africa’s national parks.
The city of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which is considered by many tourists as a major travel destination.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong’s urban skyline is likened to a glittering column chart reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of the dense urban sprawl on Hong Kong Island is located on sea-derived land along the north coast.
This is a place appropriated by British colonists, so if you are looking for proof of the colonial past of the territory, here is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest in Indian Territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps, they are some of the last remaining stretches of powerful jungle that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans area covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which approximately a third is covered by water bodies or wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a nature reserve and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian axis in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (via the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Since intercity buses are often full, we recommend buying a ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese coastal buses that are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes with a width of 3.5 meters.
The vertical ground clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, the operation was started only in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani tribe was the most prominent indigenous group inhabiting the area we know today as Eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of India", was born as a result of a meeting of Spanish conquerors with groups of indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo courts in Las Ca?itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
If you're interested in tournaments and where to get tickets for polo matches, check out Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value corresponds to one British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in remote islands, but you may succeed with British and American currency. Be sure to ask the owners in advance what payment method you can use.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so do the exchange before you leave them.
Because Montevideo lies south of the equator, summer is here when it is cold in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; temperatures above 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winters can be tricky to freeze: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but together with the wind and humidity, they seem cooler than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific periods of "rain" and "dry": The amount of precipitation remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to humans, they are still wild animals in the wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Although they look peaceful, buffalo, deer, moose, bear and almost all large animals can attack.
Many visitors get injured every year because of not keeping the right distance. These animals are big, wild and can be dangerous, so leave them their space.
Bears and other animals in the wild also attract odors, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep the campground clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the independence efforts organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the killing of the Supreme Leader, Tupu Tamases Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here due to the fact that Auckland lies between two ports. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost sandy beaches with the possibility of safe swimming and most of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour in the popular Mission Bay and St. Heliers neighborhoods of central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a large selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is “Number One”, which is not a complex beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one. The second local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many French wines you can have, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be a better choice.
Drinking tap water is safe here, but if you are afraid, bottled water is commonly available.
For Australians, the idea of coffee is "flat white" alien. Small black is "espresso", cappuccino is full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The dark chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but first-class.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries caused as a result of any of these causes are rare.
Even so, take the advice of authorities, follow the signs and pay close attention to security warnings.
The squares occur near the beaches and estuaries from October to April north of Seventeen Seventy, and can occasionally be found outside of this time.
Sharks really do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
The crocodile does not live actively in the ocean; its primary refuge is the estuary north of the town of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance gives the traveler the confidence that he will have a place to stay at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it is also possible to book other forms of accommodation as a campsite.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination of flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your booking if you need time to think about it or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any modifications or requests should be directed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel’s address.
In the case of some festivals, a substantial majority of visitors choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be at the center of the action, you will need to arrive as soon as possible to get a camping spot, located near the music production.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage may have ended, in other sections of the festival the music can continue until late into the night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with small children.
If you go across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, because cruising through the ice causes unbearable noise in exposed places.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Visa requirements do not apply to cruise passengers (see conditions).
Casinos usually try to make guests spend as much time as possible in them and spend as much money as possible. Mostly missing windows and hours, it is often difficult to find an exit out.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings to keep visitors in a good mood and on casino premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the company's behalf. However, drunkenness negatively affects the ability to judge, so all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will drive at high geographical altitude or in a mountain pass should have considered the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive the same as on bare asphalt.
During a snow storm, there is enough snow in a very short time to prevent you from driving.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or flying snow or dew or ice on the vehicle windows.
Ice and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries and traffic continues without major interruptions throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and for many tourists represents the highlight of the whole trip.
The term safari in the familiar sense of the word refers to land travel for the purpose of exploring stunning African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the vehicles, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can observe them better with binoculars.
A hiking safari consists of a hike lasting several hours to several days.
The Paralympics will run from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in different locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics since it was hosted as early as 1964.
If you booked your tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the grace notice, this situation may be difficult for you.
Event cancellation policies may vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not apply to the July 2020 Olympics scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets costing 7,000 Japanese yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help him dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards to rent, even if he is not in the room.
If there is no iron available or you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are many ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes a few minutes.
Filters have different efficiency, and if you are concerned, you should buy water in a sealed bottle from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they are unfamiliar with in their home regions.
Difficult insects can cause food spoilage, skin irritation or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, the spread of poison or transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill a person, as such, usually do not rank among the pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and other charges in the areas in question.
Travelers traveling to high-tax countries can sometimes save significant amounts, especially when buying products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, as it often passes between isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep angles, narrow lanes and sharp turns prevail.
The speed limit here is significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to it is even more important.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone services work much better here than in many stretches of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German desserts are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rich and diverse, very similar to their southern neighbours in Austria.
Fruit pastry is common. Apples are used in pastry all year round, then cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked products also contain almonds and hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular desserts are often especially suitable for a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to taste some hearty sweets, try desserts that are depending on the region called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish of various herbs, spices and meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either “dry” or “wet” depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to the curry. In the south of India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, if used without further specification, the term usually refers to cuisine originating from the central and eastern part of the island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available across the archipelago, contains a lot of simply flavoured dishes, in which peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Java coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices predominate.
The stirrups, which hang on both sides of the saddle, serve as a support for the rider's legs.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can be associated with safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's legs getting stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse, but his foot gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts to run, the rider can pull behind. A number of safety measures can be taken to minimize this risk.

The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing dates back at least to the 17th century. The first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Skiing: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, cross-country skiing or cross-country skiing.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although they are not part of this activity, with the latter being carried out on steep terrain and requiring much stronger skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route as a similar tourist route.
Under favorable conditions, you can cover slightly more distances than you can on foot - but rarely will you move at the speed you would achieve on cross-country skis without a heavy backpack and in a well-groomed track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with a number of independent countries. Normally, traveling through multiple countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control several times.
However, the Schengen area functions in a similar way to a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, which will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods more than 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations where, for example, the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Hand-made items can be classified as antiques even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer breeding is an important livelihood among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many other professions.

For example, U.S. citizens may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
The views presented are often cursory, general, and overly simplistic compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.

Reverse currents represent returning waves that break against the beach, often at the site of a cliff, etc.
Due to the underwater topology, the reverse current is concentrated in several deeper sections, and it is here that a rapid current can be formed into deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the stream, swimming back isn’t more difficult than usual.
Try heading somewhere where the current won’t pull you down again, or according to your abilities, and depending on whether they’ve noticed you, you’d better wait for help.
The shock of return comes before the culture shock (there is a smaller phase of initial enthusiasm), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to a new culture often have a particularly challenging experience of re-adapting to their native culture.
After returning home from a stay abroad, you are used to a new culture and some habits from your home have already been lost.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers in the new country had to adapt.
People may not realize that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
Pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.

In remote locations without mobile signal coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because in order to make a call, you need to be outside without obstacles between you and the satellite.
This service is often used by shipping including recreational vessels and expeditions that need remote data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with people who leave school, allowing them to take a year off before entering university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad after high school can improve your chances of higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees will usually be charged for enrolment in these training programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The “land of thousands of lakes” also includes thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
It is not necessary to have a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are really large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak will offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven to eight people.
It is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this number is one in forty).
Cruises on the Baltic Sea usually have a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit this historic city for a few whole days and at night return to the boat and sleep on it.
If you go ashore only as part of cruises, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some of the tours in the brochure include German Berlin. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the tour.
Air travel can be scary for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it’s their first flight or if they’ve had a traumatic experience.

Shipping companies are well paid for the fast delivery of goods. Time is often a very important factor for business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and smaller companies, there has been a problem.
If things were sent by air freight, then on some routes it might take several days for things to go through unloading and customs control.
The only way to do it faster is to send the item as checked baggage. However, aviation regulations do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The most common way to fly in first or business class is to pull out a fat bundle of money (even better is to get your business to do it for you).
But it’s not cheap: you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy ticket in business class and eleven times in first class!
In general, it makes no sense to look for discounts on flights from point A to point B for the first or business class.
Airlines know well that there is a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and this is also matched by the prices.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.

Regular metro announcements are only in Catalan, but unplanned outages are reported by the automated system in many different languages - Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being selfish, rude, and arrogant.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with others in Paris is to behave as best as possible, i.e. to act as someone who is “white élevé” (well-behaved). All your movement will make it much easier.
The outward impression that Parisians are somewhat violent quickly fades away if you show at least basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, especially by beech, spruce or fir trees, and offers a mixture of alpine vegetation with Mediterranean.
Due to the diverse microclimate, diverse soil and different altitudes, there are growing very different plant communities.

In addition to many more common species, rare fauna such as brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and grouse can be found here.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide plaids for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own plaid, especially colorful, you will earn a smile from a monk or nun at the entrance.
