Austria’s right-wing populists win 29 percent of the vote
The significant weakening of both sides of the previous grand coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have resulted in early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of the current chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
In contrast, the Electoral Leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZU), the Carinthian Governor Jorg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, it remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8% of the vote, but loses 5.5% of the vote against the last election in 2006.
Even worse was the OVP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in Austria’s post-war history and, especially for the people who triggered the early elections, a disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ’VP withdrew from the coalition, the People’s Party had a considerable lead over the SPD.
However, voters apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the chairman of the party and the current Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday at a special meeting of the party's chairmanship.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path to the increasingly likely exit from the electoral outcome, i.e. to the resumption of a grand coalition of SP’s and the SP’s.
However, due to the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free Party (FPO) - they gained 18 percent of the vote and the BZ party - 11 percent of the vote - at the same time, the Social Democrats voiced concerns about a repeat of 1999, when the people agreed with the populists (at that time the FPO was still united, in 2005 it split from the BZ party) on a joint government that even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to work with any party, is clearly betting on this development and expects to return to Vienna for national politics.
The Green Party got into parliament, but it lost easily and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the 4% threshold and did not make it to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may get colder
If the problem with Czech scientists accused of illegally collecting beetles could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said Czech-Indian relations would be somewhat cooled.
The minister said this in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherji.
"If it had not been resolved, then yes, then a certain cooling would have occurred," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherji said after the hearing that executive power can be difficult to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who has been acquitted and fined, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, which has jurisdiction over the matter.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the verdict to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had said the same during the meeting.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way for the Czech side to step in is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicts, the Indian minister said.
He also said that the Indian side is already providing such assistance.
"We have the utmost interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the Czech News Agency, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a profound mistake to imprison and indict these Czech scientists," he said.
The answer to the question of whether he received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter was avoided by the minister.
“I’ve made a lot of promises,” he said.
Czech Judges Struggle for the Seabed
They proceed to a wall-mounted electronic map showing Australia and the surrounding sea areas.
He is not interested in a continent, but a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the 30-member team at the UN Division of Ocean and Law of the Sea.
Its boss, the division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, monitors the interpretation and occasionally supplements it.
There's work vigor and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a hitherto little-known world, rich in natural resources.
You can find oil, ores and other mineral resources, but also previously unknown living organisms, which carry the key to the development of a cure for cancer.
The bottom is bigger than the land
Today, coastal states have begun to apply vehemently for new underwater territories.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was signed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
It has exclusive rights to all resources of the continental shelf under the Convention.
"Simply put, behind the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is the natural continuation of the continent beneath the sea.
It extends beyond the territorial sea, often beyond 200 nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by a country to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has examined five applications, namely from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three countries have succeeded so far," Mikulka added.
Australia was the first to significantly expand its underwater possessions.
He also won the award for New Zealand - the size of the seabed, which the commission acknowledged last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The benefits of using the seabed in the future will be invaluable.
Other countries will gradually submit their requests.
They can do so until ten years after they have ratified the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, declared by convention as the "common heritage of mankind".
No country has an exclusive position here.
The right of exploitation in this area is granted by a convention established by an international institution.
"But the seabed is no Klondajk," says director Mikulka in exaggeration, adding that its "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually enshrined".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares them with other states of the former Eastern Bloc under the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It acquired the status of a "pioneer investor" under the convention in 1991, as did investors from a few other states.
It is authorized to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is indented there, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It can be mined on an area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic nodules containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian worker of the division Rober Sandev brings one such concretion to show.
It resembles a small potato or, with a little imagination, a mythical shem, which, according to legend, was revived by the Golem.
German special forces were at the release of hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, the special forces were ready, but there was no deployment.
More details of the circumstances surrounding the release of 11 kidnapped European tourists are gradually coming to the public.
German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation, according to the Interior Ministry.
According to the ministry, both experts from the Federal Army and members of the German anti-terrorism group GSG9, the Federal Police squadron, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts from the Technisches Hilfswerk were at the site of the liberation.
However, according to another statement from the spokespersons of the two ministries on Monday afternoon, German forces were not needed because the kidnappers let their captives go and fled when they recognized signs of forced liberation.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for the action on the ground.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," said a spokesman for the German Interior Ministry.
The attackers abducted a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in the south of Egypt.
After the kidnapping in the desert area in the south of Egypt, hostages were moved in the border territories between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unclear until the last moment, as did the details of the release or possible ransom payment.
They are now safe in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the hostages were under the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
No word yet on when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", all five tourists with special forces should fly one of the German Air Force's Airbuses and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has narrowly dropped a $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones index fell sharply.
By 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there is no majority in favor of a program that should ease the chaos in the financial markets.
Proponents of the dramatic action desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called for the MP's consent before the vote, although, as he put it, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he said.
During the voting period, the Dow Jones index fell by more than 6 percent, or 600 points.
Investors are concerned that the state bailout could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index value rose and then plummeted again after the announcement of the package's crash.
Experts are now counting on more serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the consent of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel agents are seeing increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, travel bookings for the coming months grew significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent in the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans’ desire to travel remains unclouded.
For bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the same period last year, according to the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiserband, DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increased bookings are available for the autumn months.
According to the DRV, the turnover for October was about 11 percent higher compared to 2007.
These results are based on GfK figures, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies and interpolates them into the overall market.
This result included bookings for tours that took place until the end of August 2008.
Because of the dollar’s weak exchange rate, trips to the U.S. are in high demand, the DRV said.
For these trips, the increase in bookings is about one-third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable targets for Germans.
Especially organized tours are in the course, said the chairman of DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising energy and food costs, the costs are "easier for the client to calculate than for individually organized holidays".
Laepple explained that, among other things, consumers can save money by taking advantage of early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was very good, so there will be a higher turnover compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
An endlessly repeated pop, beer made of tuplách and prominent costumes from well-known designers.
First time in a beer field.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television presenter and wears a tailor-made costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: we are not even three minutes on a beer meadow, and already photographers are rushing at us and filling memory cards - I'm flattered, after all, I'm at Oktoberfest for the first time.
This way you can make friends.
My cheap costume seems to have served its purpose.
I’m here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my feeling of comfort in a costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing a women's costume or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
My apron alone reaps the odd glances at the banana-in-chocolate stand.
One Munich woman reminds me that I had wrongly tied her up: "You're free on the left, a virgin in the middle, on the right, widowed in the back."
I secretly flip the bow from the back to the left.
“Okay,” he says and laughs.
Others with subtle flirting techniques are less engaged and wear simple felt hats that say "To drink to get dressed!" and stick out naked asses at passers-by.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is named Bob, he is from England and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He seems "gorgeous", with an extended "oh".
That's what he tells me after he's relieved himself of his drinking of butter.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage cans.
Bob is therefore one of the dreaded "Wildbiesler", as in Bavaria it is called in public to urinate freely.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, there are a lot of paramedics running around the Oktoberfest area, who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - in four they wear covered gurneys from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to the beer meadow: empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the tarp of this coffin of promiscuity is not visible.
"It's the so te that can't go on," one of the paramedics calls me in answer to my question and disappears in the crowd.
Police release the name of the victim of the accident
The name of the 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex was released.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has already been released on police bail.
Turkey's diplomatic horizons are widening
Long before Turkey began its bid to join the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into Turkey’s shores.
On the east bank of the Bosphorus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the finest monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
This is what the tourist guides will tell you.
The building sits astride at the end of platforms with a tower at each corner of the facade, seemingly indistinguishable from any provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once one gets inside the vault, one can no longer doubt the size of the enterprise whose westernmost gate of the station was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdadi Corporation.
Germany, which was late in the empires’ game, intended to realize its ambition to dominate the Middle East with the help of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
The relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
British and colonial troops advanced out of Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for the Hydarpasha station as well.
In 1917, the explosion of an ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually crumbling and history has been bypassing it.
But today, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is getting involved.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was to meet one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten-and-a-half hours later, I arrived in a Turkish metropolis designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
It aroused suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi took me to the main tent of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built in an emerging suburb, surrounded by half-built department stores and power shops, where middle managers in business suits - men and women - meet to do early morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could well be a centre-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
“The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its predicament.
Today, you have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
She had to do both.
"But surely the time will come," I asked, "when might Turkey have to make a decision?"
“Turkey,” he said, “didn’t want that decision to happen.”
He then emphasized what almost everyone I spoke with here had said almost memorably: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea environs are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, follow these tracks eastward to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another mostly sleepless night, I thought of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Cona, who watched as this building was being built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East may now be, for the most part, in Turkish hands.
And while I was waiting at the port for the ferry back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days, Turkey was called the "sick man of Europe".
So it seems that, at least then, there wasn’t much doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district's music plan, he set up an excellent choir of young Proteus a year later.
He was supposed to be under 21, but by the time Proteus last sang in 1979, there were a few of us nearly 30 - we simply refused to give up that chorus.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape-shifter) represented the choir's willingness and ability to embark on whatever music was presented to it - either madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often astounding, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely unchanged all the time.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it!"
His baton technique was perfectly clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Wherever the standard of music was, it was always elevated.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If any conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I have reviewed over 100 of his concerts over the past 40 years or so, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with any of them - and have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply “dragged one or two soaked stones around the world.”
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (25 September) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while also studying at BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's note to the author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time completed a dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent the 1950s-51s in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend José Vicente Resina's exhibition 'Flamenco and Life' because his documentary black-and-white photographs are amazing.
I was captivated by the simplicity and strong charge with which it impresses the audience, and by the consideration and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda will launch its best-seller for the second time
Honda will launch the second generation Jazz in November.
If the predecessor of this one-seater vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is complemented by improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow for greater fuel efficiency.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes to this one-space car.
For example, innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines should be mentioned.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing to notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period of time to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a less well-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case of Japan, the country where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during 2008.
Almost one million units have been sold in Japan since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market was the old continent, with approximately half a million units sold in six years.
Honda is aiming for the new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
While the Japanese company sold 83,000 units of the Honda Jazz in 2007, in 2009 it was estimated that 100,000 cars would be sold in the European market, an increase of 17%.
In terms of the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units for the whole year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company expects to close the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which means 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this, Honda relies on the success of its new model.
Honda Insight is a compact, 4.37-metre five-door hybrid that the Japanese company expects to sell around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
In terms of markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be split between the old continent and Japan.
Honda Insight is expected to launch in the first few months of next year, when it is unveiled to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions of the new Jazz have increased.
Its length has increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more), and wheelbase to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
The increase in size has also increased the internal space.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by placing a fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the luggage compartment volume - which has a double bottom system - has increased to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the luggage compartment volume of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur on the 1.4 engine version, as the luggage compartment volume of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
In addition to exterior features, such as LED rear lights and the option of a glass panoramic roof, it is also easier to access the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to the 67 on the first Jazz model.
The second generation Honda Jazz also features new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower fuel consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvements to the drive system at the same time with high torque in the full engine speed range.
The first 1.2-liter engine has a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 hp on the previous generation Jazz - consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, the current one will reach 100.
The Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 hp has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Car bee" prevents collisions
This time, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, specifically from bees, to advance the development of accident-protection technologies.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the example of flying bees and thus prevents collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technology.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co. have developed the robot in collaboration with the Center for Advancement in Science and Technology at Japan’s prestigious University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general manager of public relations for the brand's technology, research and development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan's four safety shield zones.
The robot has the task of strengthening the ability to prevent collisions with cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that closely resembles a Nissan safety shield.
However, the most important are compound bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, the engineers designed what they called a laser range finder.
It records obstacles that are up to two meters in a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it into a collision warning.
“The moment an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the bee’s movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to a right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are absolutely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards or downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction allowed by the rotation of its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities, as in the case of bees.
In addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent collisions.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and according to this data it needs to be preserved.
It does not require information storage or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we’re not talking about gigs or megas in memory.”
This is the first step in the development of new collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be used in production cars in a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to integrate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the destination and avoid obstacles on the road.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury, in addition to having enough capital to give out injections, lacks inventiveness.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages at banks with questionable solvency, it has created a popular-educational game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
It wasn't "bad credit hotel"... or a muddled hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionists look gloomy, so that one can think once, twice or three times whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And most of all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It is a website that is more suitable for young people than for the general public.
What happens when the game ends?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
At least, because I don't want to talk about buying a house.
Morgan Stanley opens its MUFG capital
Morgan Stanley has announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, is entering its midst, spending $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report was accompanied by a significant drop in its exchange rate.
A week after revealing their preliminary deal, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares for a single price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion to acquire convertible securities that will yield a 10% return at an exchange price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the entire operation will take place on the basis of an average unit price of $29, i.e. 28% below its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley’s stock was down 6.79% and went to $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said John Mack, CEO of Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new statute last week to allow it to diversify its operations, but it places it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Its merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest aces to take a more cautious approach than before.
The terms of the deal, which was unveiled Monday, show that the deal has been altered over the past few days: Morgan just announced last Monday that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“We thought a week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, CEO of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, “that our participation would consist entirely of ordinary shares.
However, given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to keep the risks to a minimum and also cover up."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less than their book value for Morgan Stanley securities.
And the operation will result in a reduction in earnings on the share by about 20%.
The agreement foresees that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares within a year if the latter are exchanged for a certain period of time at a price 50% above the exchange price, i.e., about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, a spokesman for the group declined to give any details about the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "sensibly" reduced his balance sheet since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its stock exchange rate has halved, while insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have skyrocketed.
These costs took the opposite turn on Monday, but remained high, at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's buyout, announced that it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Re-establishing a republic around 21st century socialism.
This is a joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third appointee put to the vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends, a draft of the new Constitution.
And his mission is accomplished, because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, "No" received 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid, and 0.7% of the ballots were blank.
In order for the draft Constitution to be passed, it had to receive half the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted at the exit from polling stations and a calculation by a non-governmental organization predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, placing them between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa called for the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night.
"The Constitution has won all the way," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil gubernatorial headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which the Organization of States of America's (OEA) observation mission said took place peacefully, concerned a text about 444 points building the "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over economics by reserving to it the "planning for development" of a country living primarily from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The proposal, backed by Correa, who was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to serve two consecutive four-year terms and be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power to seek a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the constitution reinforces the principle of free health and education that the president has begun to implement in a country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, thereby ending the agreement between Washington and Quito on the use of the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 hostages freed in Chad
The Egyptian commando took 11 tourists and their eight-member escorts who were captured 10 days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been held captive in the desert for ten days, were taken alive and well to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning, an Egyptian commando set them free in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, aboard a special aircraft at the Al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately taken, without being able to express themselves in the press, aboard helicopters to a hospital in Maadi, a suburban residential area of Cairo, to be subjected to medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the hijackers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garrana said on the airport's taxiway.
Since their capture on September 19, during a four-wheel drive safari in the foothills of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard, the director of the Aegyptus agency, a safari organizer.
A senior Egyptian security official has indicated that 30 special forces troops who approached the scene aboard two helicopters went down during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half of the hijackers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "flash" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is now, mentioned the role played by secret agents and Italian special forces.
"We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and effectiveness of the people of our secret services, the special forces," he said.
He also denied that a ransom would be paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese military said it had seized a four-wheel-drive vehicle carrying the hijackers, killing six including a Chadian commander and arresting two.
The army claimed they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The silent majority of the resort culture
The debate over funding for culture fills the pages of newspapers with headlines and is the subject of an ongoing election campaign.
All the better.
However, one aspect of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to denounce the pitiful sums that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national sites that are starving to death?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and his historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has donated three and a half million euros to the restoration of a mere Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
For our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans, and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives, and by all regional organizations, in synergy.
In Québek, a federation of societies for the history of Québek, at least 40,000 volunteers from 211 societies for history, monuments, archives, and genealogies work to uncover history, preserve a pile of private archives, and protect archaeological remains for a few pennies.
Often, these societies are the watchdogs of our monuments, driven by despair to protest as promoters and leaders launch their bulldozers at old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see the tribune for history and monuments?
Benelux Governments to Nationalise Fortis Bank
The Benelux states will help Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the spreading effect of the US mortgage market crisis, by partial nationalization: the three countries will support a monetary and insurance institution, which also has a capital stake in Hungary, with an amount of 11.2 billion euros.
The agreement was reached this weekend at the highest level by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first bank in the euro area to experience a major crisis in the context of the international financial markets crisis, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions made on this issue could, in some respects, be seen as precedents.
Under the terms of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy up nearly half (49 percent) of the bank's assets there.
The bank will sell part of its capital holdings with complete certainty, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Shares of Fortis Bank began to fall sharply last week, in the second half of the week there were already serious signs of the crisis in the Institute.
Analysts say the bank and its 85,000 employees are too big to let it go bankrupt.
The company's securities fell 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year low.
The value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds since January.
Given current share prices, the group’s total market capitalization is around 14 billion euros, but this is unrealistic, according to business leaders.
The company blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the US $700 billion package.
On Monday, the shares increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx, the new CEO, was appointed head of the bank.
The institute was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has yet come forward.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
There has been no panic among the bank’s clients, and the branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis Bank has a separate branch and has also acquired several leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people’s drug purchase data, often dismiss the possibility of entering into an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescription drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of an independent person, otherwise we entrust the chicken coop to a fox," said Richard Dick, the author of the prescription-tracking program.
Insurance companies make insurance premiums and the amounts paid in case of insured events depend on the health condition of the candidates, and if the risk is assessed as too great, they do not even conclude insurance with it.
They used to send people for medical examinations, and they only made contracts when they knew the results.
A decade ago, Dick devised a much cheaper method: using a pharmacy identification number, the customer can easily find out what drugs the person has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program will deduce for itself what kind of disease he suffers and what his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large number of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it refers to the fact that he has a virtually uncontrollably high level of blood fats, which immediately puts him in the category of higher risk.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of them also determine the risk coefficient at the same time, so there is almost no work left for the insurance company except for paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
Disadvantages include that some drugs can be used for several purposes, some compounds are useful against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
From the point of view of commercial insurance companies, these represent a significant risk-increasing factor, while the former problems do not.
Special companies have been set up to request and process the data and ask the patient’s permission before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their past negligence.
Recently, some companies have been working on the results of laboratory tests, which combine with data about the drugs used, thanks to which they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, at the same time it will become increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is a special law for the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which will give authorities the power to control companies specializing in providing data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his programme in such a way that the transfer of data is subject to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that he can hardly refuse the permission, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the chickens are somewhat dependent on the fox's good will.
The global Marseille menu
India and EU to double trade
Since the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this topic has dominated the agenda of the ninth meeting at the highest level, alongside other, mostly global, issues.
There will also be a Franco-Indian summit today on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
Indeed, the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given a greater say in international affairs, but member countries have so far failed to find a common denominator in supporting New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not even further discussed at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double or increase trade turnover to more than 100 billion euros in five years.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an over-ambitious target.
Twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally aligned in this respect, so air travel will also be given the green light in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi ranks ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively, terrorism - both sides in all its forms condemned and called for the urgent convening of a UN conference.
They have also called for the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade talks, although both have played a large part in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate agenda to reduce its emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India has also agreed to this, as well as the fact that at the climate conference next year it would be necessary to conclude a global agreement and reduce the production of greenhouse gases by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food prices from rising and support the convening of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India will travel to the French capital today, where he is preparing to conclude a trade on the peaceful use of atomic energy during a bilateral meeting.
Paris is confident that French companies will be entrusted with the construction of India’s 20 billion euro nuclear reactors.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishers will participate in the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries to take up 171,790 square meters of the fair, with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as the guest of honor.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony at the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) - at 264 square meters of exhibition space.
This will be followed by a meeting with the press at Room Struktur Buchmesse in Hall 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present the numbers, tendencies and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the overall Italian production is decreasing, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
Steve Fossett's plane, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago, has been found
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was found, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying across the Nevada desert.
The wreckage was discovered on one plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dispelled the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we have the certainty that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at one press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been presumed dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Security Bureau (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreckage was detected, an investigation team was dispatched to eventually identify the plane: it is exactly the Bellanc 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal items were found by a single couple near their dwelling in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, for cash and one jacket.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has won a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a world tour in an air balloon: a two-week flight alone.
Three years later, he flew around the world on a plane without landing.
His many records also include flying at 15,445 metres, over the Andes, albeit with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with an original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compact" jeep house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to inject a whirlwind of news into this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional processing that the unexpected and unconventional communication, which will accompany the launch of Suv Glk on the market, will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
In this way, the advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new vehicle will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan's main business class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision, and with the help of special glasses, which will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, if you look at the picture, you will get the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at various moments in all its details, to then reassemble into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will he be able to attract the interest of future customers in this way? We will see.
Now we know who the Italian hooligans are.
From Trivenet, risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls for whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been following Nazionale azzurra for years and which has, in truth, never made excessive problems so far.
She's never even met her opponent's fans.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders come from Triveneta.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-color flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening they were removed so that they would not be recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found true Nazi fans, Levski.
Figc made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all in name, thus easily controllable.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Daslo, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and banned from the match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the news that will come from the Bulgarian police, then they will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will never set foot in a stadium again.
Here's to luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that means more than a hundred and fifty will join the ranks.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not justify those who behave in this way," Viminal said.
So, "well-open eyes, mainly because of the national game on Wednesday in Leche".
In Puglia there is a small core of supporters.
Osservatorio will meet tomorrow, Tuesday Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, the secret service that takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"College Leader-Leader and Arms Stretched During Mameli's Anthem? It's Not a Crime in Bulgaria...".
Such is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really unlucky way), who is the director of the Viminálsky Osservatorium for a few weeks (he won the post that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a quaestor in Trieste, where the core supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, are located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate leaders, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
“I’m not a sociologist,” adds Osservator No. 1, “crimes are attributed to the country in which they occurred.
So far, this group has remained within limits, now let's take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let us also talk about the whistle at Mameli's hymn: it is not a crime either, but if you will allow it, it is rude...".
