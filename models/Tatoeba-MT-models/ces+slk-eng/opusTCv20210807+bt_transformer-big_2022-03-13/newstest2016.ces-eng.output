In an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend
During a call to the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to police that he had shot his girlfriend and it is necessary for them to come to their home.
Lamb resolved that his "sweet little dog" was alive and probably upset at the house, and that contacts to the family of the dead woman could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I am so sorry and wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she is the only one who has ever loved me," the letter said.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot popular professor Ethan Schmidt at his office door.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb reportedly made a fateful call to an emergency line shortly thereafter.
Eventually, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, the authorities are still trying to figure out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details released by state investigators and the students and staff who knew him together created an image of a talented but likely troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in a thank you to the "great people" with whom he shared an academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students took courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations when it came to problems.
The student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaky, "as if something were wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave on medical grounds, saying he had a problem.
And this year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's staff recruitment meant that a doctorate that Lamb had worked hard on would not have guaranteed him an automatic tenure to become an assistant professor.
William LaForge, president of the university, said that he knew of no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr Lamb was obviously troubled by something."
Lamb won't answer those questions anymore.
After leaving campus, police caught his trail as he crossed the Arkansas state border back to Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single pistol shot in the courtyard of his home about a mile from his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington state coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb was driving to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this county.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
In the spring he received his doctorate in education.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older guy who tutored her on guitar for several years.
He was quite the heartbreaker at the time.
The hearts of all the girls were scarred as soon as he showed up," said Hairston, who is now 40 and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for some time.
During an emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the marriage record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the arm of the Gautier River.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19.
"She was completely collapsed," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was the best friend with her mother.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were studying at a summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, a pot that Lamb had finished playing guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything bad.
“They were a happy couple,” he said.
We played and played each other a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a slain professor, led a first-year seminar specializing in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people including faculty members, staff, students, and community members attended a candlelight commemorative event.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
School started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this reportage.
This story has been edited to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made a phone call to an emergency line after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year, but the toy and product maker says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will begin recruiting candidates this month, and will recruit staff during October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching, and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help out in stores and sales, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized the seat next to me was empty and I figured Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The movie begins, and I realize that I am within reach of what might be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "Back to the Future," featuring interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's truly the best travel documentary ever made for me."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s accelerated military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of a ministerial session of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that divisions within the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers had "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they showed in reaching an Iranian nuclear deal to resolve the crisis in Syria.
8 election numbers that show Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to describe him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands like a joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But whether some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are failing (yet).
10 of the last 11 national polls show that Donald Trump is in the lead by a two-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously question what this means for the nomination chances of this real estate tycoon.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership made way for Herman Cain's ascension, in the end, neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are aware of Trump’s will to endure and are starting to put their dollars on hold to bring him down.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest the real estate tycoon is not just a passing phase:
Trump’s approval rating has gone 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are held in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll last week found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "indignant" at his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “enthusiastic” against 40 percent saying the same about Trump).
The next closest in level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "disappointed" or "excited" if the business favorite Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pomp and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationally inclined to the idea that the real estate magnate has the right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same figure holds at the Iowa State Senators' Club, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of Republicans think it has the personality of a commander, according to last week's Quinnipiac.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temper doesn’t belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When he puts on his scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
When asked who would most likely win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
By this time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans had chosen Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney.
Yet a certain number of GOP voters seem to view the Trump campaign as credible.
Even though Republicans have rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that a fragmented field likely contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by Monmouth University in early September shows that in the hypothetical direct fight between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gains majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the dealer by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
The vast majority of Donald Trump supporters say they have already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters who support Trump say they won’t change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
Forty-six percent said they keep their back door open for change among candidates.
Still, Trump’s current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their view final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign’s announcement speech, immigration has still held as the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump’s pomp will draw key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage efforts to rebrand.
But according to a new Monday poll by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain, too.
Frustration from the government is reaching new highs.
Today, Donald Trump and Ben Carson receive roughly half of the support from Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll on Monday say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
A vote by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "disgruntled" and 21 percent "hellishly angry."
The House supported a greater share of the state's coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of the yield of brown coal mining fees from the mining company.
Minister Jan Mládek (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD) promised MPs that they would get extra money from both the state treasury and municipal budgets.
The bill has been criticised by opposition MPs, who fear that mining firms will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have been since they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House at first reading supported the government's amendment to the mining bill, which means, among other things, that the state should receive a greater share of the revenue from brown coal surface mining fees from the mining company.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The template also changes the way the payment for minerals mined by companies is calculated.
The change in fees for mining is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets should have a neutral impact, because the fee should be higher.
Last year, municipalities received CZK 450 million in fees and the state budget CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal cost municipalities about CZK 200 million and the state CZK 66 million.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the payment from mining premises with permitted mining to 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to belong to municipalities in its entirety.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that municipalities will gain CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million per year instead of CZK 14 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be set by the government by its regulation.
Reimbursement is newly calculated as the product of the amount of minerals mined and the rate for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by government decree may not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax because the state charges for the mineral, which is state property.
Fees are paid only to municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of underground coal mining, three-quarters of the municipality’s money and a quarter of the state’s.
The same ratio will be in the case of the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money collected by the state in mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would harm communities affected by mining and regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and the Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to have the finance minister improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.
KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned about the rise in unemployment in Mostek.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent long-term negotiated.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, in her view, the increase in fees is acceptable in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur on the amendment, Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial for MPs to know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government’s decision on the limits of coal mining before the law is passed.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have impacts on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak Army should be made only after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken due to social, economic and long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Veselý will lead the Czechs as number one, deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear in Thursday's draw of the Davis Cup in India on the board, and this time each of them will probably intervene in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to distribute the load over the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
Delhi is hot and humid, so matches are expected to be tough and can stretch up to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out according to the weather.
And depending on how it will look, Navrátil said during today's training of the Czech selection in the center of Raj Kumar Khanna.
With the number one team and the world number 40 Jiří Veselý counts on Friday and Sunday singles.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are probably in the second position.
I would like almost everyone to be involved.
“It’s in my head, but I won’t say it yet,” the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be Štěpánek’s participation in Saturday’s doubles.
The only question is who will stand next to an experienced doubles doubles doubles doubles doubles doubles doubles doubles player 18-4.
It's probably not going to be fun.
There are options with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
"I really don't know with whom and how it will look," he said.
It will be decided according to the development of doubles.
Pavlásek may be a variant, with Veselý surprised in the 1st round by winning the double over the Australians.
"He's a decent guy," he said back.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I would like to do the same performance that I showed there from the second set.
"I am happy for the experience and would like to bring a point," Pavlasek said.
The home team will play Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won the challenger in Shanghai last week, where he defeated the third and fourth-hundred players in the rankings.
Somdev Devvarman (164).
They are both challengers and ours have ATP Tour experience, but we’ve seen many times that the Davis Cup rankings don’t decide.
"The current form, the weather, is decisive," he said.
Friday's opening singles games start at 6:30 CEST and may stretch due to the weather.
It is forecast to rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, it can be played under artificial lighting.
They've already ignited it, and it's got about 2,000 lux, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s PMQ debut has been highly anticipated.
New working leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his Prime Minister's Questions debut later, and will have to work with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be scrutinised carefully by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement, he demanded "less theatre and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership to come after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet and his speech to the TUC Annual Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence while singing the national anthem on duty on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of several front-page stories.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention to himself
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he would "stand in respectful silence" and that he would recognise "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend the Labour leader sing the national anthem "irrespective of" his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences in economics, defense, and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also being "stored up" after Mr Corbyn's appointment despite his position in the European Union and the government's limit on benefits.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had put forward amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the dose limit.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, secretary of shadow labor and pensions, stated that the party had "very clearly" opposed government plans to lower the limit from $26,000 to $23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Party leader David Cameron has faced in decades since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The Labour Party leader, who promised a different approach to politics, claims to have "out of the crowd" ideas on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQs are too confrontational and that they refrain from both "smooth answers," and toothed trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ if he doesn't attend - such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea of letting other colleagues speak for him from time to time, saying he had discussed the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics that was often associated with PMQ, but he admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been seen as a key barometer of the leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House, and their attitude among other MPs, despite critics arguing that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Photoshooting in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But one group of former street kids found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound is rising, while salary growth in the UK is accelerating
The pound jumped the following data and showed a recovery in British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led above by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June, GB profits, including bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest rate since 2009, and it looked like it was getting closer to an estimate of when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505, and was up 0.84% against the euro to $1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped 20% after receiving a close call offer from its rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring closer brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9 percent higher after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales results are above expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.

JD Sports up 3.1% after sports firm reported an 83% jump in mid-year pre-tax profits of $46.6m
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expansion
The executive chairman of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says a higher minimum wage for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But buying power is unlikely to outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
Costs could hit plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment building cheer marshmallows.
Controversial construction has come to a halt.
The investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be illegal and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested in front of the Prague 1 office in the vicinity of the Convent of St. Agnes in the centre of Prague.
In the decision, the municipality stated that there had been a breach of the Building Act because not all the requirements of the zoning decision had been complied with.
"The substantive zoning decision does not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, a sufficiently clearly and comprehensibly described shape of the building, the delimitation of the territory affected by the impact of the construction," the decision reads.
The Magistrate also considers it illegal that some documents for the decision were issued for the originally discussed documentation, but this has changed.
Take, for example, the position of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
From the file material it follows that the owner of the land has thus only documented the consent to the project documentation for the territorial proceedings, not the consent to the location of the construction on their land, writes the Department of Building Regulations.
According to Francesco Augusto Razetta from the investor firm, the Building Regulations Department did not take into account the decision of the superior body - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the time limit for the initiation of the review has already expired.
This is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, we comply with all laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all relevant authorities and institutions," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmallow due to the allegedly proposed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city center in the past to protest the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses are bothered that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that should have looked different.
They also criticize the inappropriateness of the building for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Convent of St. Agnes.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project was changed several times.
Based on the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NPÚ), the Ministry of Culture rejected the original design of the 2008 project, which envisaged a glass facade, and cancelled the permission of Prague conservationists in 2010.
However, the new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces was approved by the NPÚ and the municipal conservationists and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the reproaches of opponents, saying he never counted on a facade in pink, which gave the project the nickname of a pink-and-white confectionery.
A Czech politician has taken the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he and his crew took in three Syrian refugees, who they said were about half a kilometer away.
At that time, he said, it was not a crime in Hungary, he told the People’s Newspaper.
We knew that law enforcement officers were not affected by this kind of behavior.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to pre-trial detention in Szeged.
In the end, he spent nine hours in the cell.
The police officers reportedly behaved correctly, but communication was jammed because they did not speak English very well.
The prison, he said, was sad.
For example, in our cell of about three by four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were crowded.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there the next day and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them next, Berg said.

Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA business from the onslaught of Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers join brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tastings at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when a food, alcohol and hardware retailer will celebrate its annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA business steps and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria, and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the SA and 24 percent in the WA, compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will crack down on 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening the first stores that took over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, and will generate sales of USD 500 and 600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in Metcash’s fixed price base could cost it around $13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that shoppers in the IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, senior fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of financial group Magellan, said business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
But it's known that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglass last week.
The IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from the Metcash grocery store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational evolution of change speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesalers have gone into a counterattack and are investing more than $150 million a year to match the counter prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip stores by adding fast-growing food and news from privateers.
The CEO of Metcash, Ian Morrice, says that price-matching and store retrofitting programs will catch on, and hopes that wholesale will return to basic profitable profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became a collateral loss during a recent fuss around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia's president, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention thanks to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by a referee, Harrison then stated, "Wawrinka was supposed to stretch one for Kyrgios and I was supposed to stretch him too."
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after a spasm thwarted Richard Gasquet's possible run at the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis unwaveringly defended Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for a place in the second doubles behind Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensely about the fact that I think Thanasi was a little involved in the whole dispute," Healy said.
He destroyed his racket when he lost due to a spasm in the US, but he is not the first player to vent his anger on his racket due to frustration. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say that he will not be proud of this event.
But he really handled himself very well because he was subjected to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he has been treated a bit harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits the team great and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in amazing shape, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios due to an important match starting on Friday, stating that "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but encouraging a Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term fixture.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the game and not all the controversy that has arisen around it," says Healy.
And I think Nick has gone up very fast, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, he's growing fast in the eyes of the public, he's also made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight when he can think about it is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and for himself.
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of a state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining those who attempted to cross it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants piled up in no man’s land, and Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.
Those who are stuck for an unknown time on the belts of the land between two states stand those who are fleeing violence in their native lands, setting up tents and settling in.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants together cry "Open the borders!" and scold the riot police.
Some refuse food and water.
Serbia’s foreign minister says it was “unacceptable” for refugees to be sent back from Hungary as more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just an indirect harm.
In the coming days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after a bloc of 28 states failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in a surprised Italy and Greece, and spoke with hope of reaching an eventual deal next month or the end of the year by which the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, did not pin its hopes on Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in the two southern regions gave authorities more power to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up court cases of asylum hearings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even the prisoners were on a list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are looking for a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalize violations of a four-meter fence the government has built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provide for longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are quite clear on this: illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the military deployment expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have been observing heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs at the border for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic defense adviser, said authorities had caught 45 people who had tried to cross the border and 15 had already been caught in the state's territory.
They penetrated through the damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under new laws.
Authorities quickly repaired the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after they used a barbed wire-covered tow truck.
There was chaos at the main border crossing near Roszka because the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing and people were being crushed.
About 20 came in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked a major highway connecting Serbia and Hungary by refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her lead.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will become president, gets support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the main competitions, the most democratic voters claim that it is too early to say that they are clearly making a decision which candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since CBS News polling last month, Clinton has lost ground with several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among men has declined significantly, and Sanders is only losing 5 points to her.
Clinton’s advantage with Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated and they are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has a lot of leadership thanks to her senior voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among liberals, but now Sanders is only 5 points behind her in that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the states say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she is a candidate.
6% would not support it.
It’s no surprise that Clinton’s supporters are particularly passionate about her.
Views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also a great opportunity for choice and consensus on issues.
While the vice president is considering a potential run for president, 57% of Democratic primary voters would like him to face it - a third think he should not run.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party's nomination, Biden was the most common choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half cited Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be elected is increasing.
However, when it came to the issue of greater importance of the candidate, Democratic voters prefer to solve problems rather than have a greater chance of being elected.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate is posing as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, perform well in some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and trustworthy, and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads out of all three in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are aligned with their ideological view.
As for all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as Secretary of State, the majority of primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter, saying it has not affected their overall view of her at all.
But it's a different story overall among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the issue was divided back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say this email controversy has had no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent say their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
More than six in 10 Republicans say their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among her party’s voters, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think it is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country don’t see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
But Clinton and Trump both have good leadership marks.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush performed best in honesty.
Sanders is seen by more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters didn't make up their minds about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ends up with Donald Trump in national election
Ben Carson gets closer to Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, and the others are seeking support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump with an overwhelming majority, climbing from 23% support in the most recent CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson performed well across demographic groups, knocking Trump out of the university-educated Republican electorate.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorino and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is behind, along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, completely on the gallery floor, with 10% backing falling to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus-minus 6%, held in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson improved and reached 19% support among Republicans behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
In the wake of Carson’s rising trend, Trump decided to shoot a retired neurosurgeon blind, and even apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Charged with Death of First-Year Baruch College Student
Nearly two years after the student died during a fraternal overloading ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges were filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College fraternity Pi Delta Dogs brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Police say he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach the target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood members did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
However, they took the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood's national president, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, members began to hide the equipment and essentially preferred the well-being of the fraternity to the life of Michael Deng," Chief Wagner said.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck with a blunt object in the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternal overloading, and at least one student has been dying every year due to overloading since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, wrote in a statement.
The brotherhood and its members must take responsibility, and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
A grand jury of Monroe County recommended third-degree murder charges for the top five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity canceled its relationship with the local branches.
This is what happens when the Fed raises interest rates
Rates will rise and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy in particular, the history of the small originator offers about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will respond.
That is why officials at the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate hikes begin, but rather a trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss over speeding can be exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to more common but still low ones to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the past month or so, the expected rate hikes may make the air a bit volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be as dramatic.
“There seems to be a trend for the stock to stop again 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a monetary policy lag,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed increases.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years has often most often - about 14 percent - headed for rate increases in a fairly flat 250 days (an average 2.6 percent increase), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rate hikes and the return is beginning to decline.
A recession is a fact of economic life, but raising rates often helps.
The Fed is currently facing some conditions that did not exist before and that could precipitate a recession.
The most notable is that gross domestic product near its lowest point in history at the Fed’s rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 1950, the nominal year-on-year increase in GDP was only twice as high as 4.5%.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expected it to be sustained when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic context could be risky, and the question could arise "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready to grow the Fed all year, and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, held this week and ending on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading only indicates a 25% probability.
“In our study since 1950, all growth cycles to date have been in a super-leverage cycle with GDP obscuring the peaks of the onset of the recession very quickly after recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery since the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of any Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still going on.
The fixed yield was also volatile, as the market expects rates to rise, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks experience.
The main difference is that the impact is more quickly seen in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increases, bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rate hike will cause yields to converge between long- and short-dated bonds, equalling the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although "we are still cautious about yield tightening," said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already aligned with Fed policy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will win after the interest rate rises, and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will fare worse, because a rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space, and their debt will also be greater.
“History shows that stock ‘quality’ tends to outperform itself within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak balance sheet companies in every interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as low volatility stocks, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will become a big problem.
Companies with high floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to purely stock games, consumers are also benefiting from the rising dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised this station for "stunning"
He thinks he is becoming more and more indistinguishable from his commercial rival.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and says they simply cheat on the British
MEP Damien Collins attacks Voice and says it’s not an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" on Classic FM, a leading MP claims, and heaps fresh pressure on broadcasters to prove they're doing something commercial broadcasters don't.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio station appears to be "stupid" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like using the word 'stupid' - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, appear to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that I can think of where you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC's director general dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival when it came to live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I could not learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and making music is actually top-notch.
“I also think Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is very important as well,” he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage audiences than before because Britons are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's production to come under fire for stepping on the heels of commercial competitors during broadcasts of Culture, Media and Sport and to be heard by the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated price of $22 million.
Do you see why this program is being discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George shine as judges - was produced "in a manner typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" next time it starts a fun series.
However, he declined to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending taxpayers' royalties on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August, and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000.
Internet sales boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe Black Friday could be a reason to brake spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, turning many of Britain’s main streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and new figures show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the lowest increase since the very beginning of the 2000 measurements, with an increase of just 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and new figures show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look back to the 2000s, the growth rate has always been rationalized over time,” Andy Mulcahy, IMRG’s revenue index editor, told the Guardian.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and were able to make purchases in a variety of contexts, such as on a sofa.
But now it is somewhat stagnant, and therefore seems to be fading away.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was borrowed from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe customers could refrain from shopping ahead of this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, more than five times as many shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases and crash several retailers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers bargain again, can keep customers from buying more
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only 1 out of every 5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims Bury Crane Victims in Mecca and Bin Laden Family Sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets by Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group.
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane fall in the Grand Mosque in Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims down the street.
Dressed in some white, the mourners chose a path and paid tribute to the victims when the first of the fallen made his final journey to the cemetery at Al-Moaissem.
A sad message passed by the holy place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and fell upon the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial, and the Saudi king sanctioned the construction group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
29 dead after crane collapse at Grand Central Mosque in Mecca
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that a haj to Mecca will take place, and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decree, carried by a state-run Saudi news agency, states that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the crash.
The disc agency's English service did not report this detail, but said the company's bosses were banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims covet before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the crane collapse and were not reported to its representatives for comment.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and a lack of coordination with weather officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, part of a massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades, and they are running major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of an apostate whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The crash took place in the midst of a strong wind and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim must undertake at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals will be donated to the relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
Other injuries receive half of this amount.
B&Q CEO Says Eastern European Traders Working for Cheap Aren't Trending
Britons increasingly employ artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is beyond the point of growth
The result is an open 200 Screwfix trades aimed at traders
Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, Senior Correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British put away hammers and brushes and hand them over to trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home.
If you're good with a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing artisans to do DIY work at their home, according to the company's CEO at Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the home goods chain, says the large increase in the number of trained Eastern European merchants offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury says she wants to hire more women at B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halves.
Today, the majority of workers are male.
She said there is a need to address rising demographic trends that show more female households making more home adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says: “We still have men working in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% of purchasing decisions.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Laura, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies according to the UK FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the equivalence between male and female CEOs.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the female workforce, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms. Laury says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it was not difficult to find good women to take with us.
Kingfisher reported a drop in both profit in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the cost of closing stores.
The Kingfisher trend, which is owned by Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It's justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said TOP 09 vice-chairman Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
Zbyněk Stanjura, chair of the ODS MPs, noted that while the one-off contribution sounds good, it would be better in the long run to be in standard valorization, as it would be reflected in the coming years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to do that," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Czech Minister Michaela Marksová (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD), which was to be valorized next year beyond the scope of the law.
Marksová defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not rosy.
Higher valorization next year would mean a budgetary impact of 5.5 billion crowns and ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD) reminded the right that the pace of valorisation has decreased in the past.
Rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right-wing veto will significantly complicate the payment in December and possibly make it impossible, he said.
The chair of the ČSSD MPs, Roman Sklenák, therefore, proposed shortening the time limit for discussing the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, which the right blocked.
However, the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost CZK 1.73 billion in total.
The money will come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Pensions are expected to increase by an average of 100 crowns next year.
According to the pension amendment, people who will be entitled to a pension or a part of it in December should receive the contribution.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their pension entitlement in December before it was paid.
However, they would have to apply for a premium in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are valued on a regular basis as of January, namely by rising prices and a third of real wage growth.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of the gross wage, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
According to the state closing account, the state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more year-on-year.
Spending on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget spending and 46 percent of all spending required by law.
The average full old-age pension increased by CZK 104 to CZK 10,714 last year, according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
According to Russian media, the billionaire’s seat was almost certain.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the West-Russian Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Tsukanov defended his position in Sunday's elections as a candidate of the ruling United Russia party.
According to Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but are chosen by the governor from three candidates, whose names they announce before the gubernatorial elections.
After the election, a senator from the three candidates will be chosen.
It was a complication for Yakunin that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years, as required by law.
The Kremlin has found an exception for Yakunin, saying that he is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador to whom the legal requirement of long-term residence does not apply.
The Czech comedy The Theory of the Tiger has ended.
The last drop in the hero's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janžurová decided on her grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he is on a similar journey with his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live again with dignity and freedom.
He wants to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the past, Slavík said.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedic way a type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible, would play the lead role.
Nevertheless, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with convalescence after a serious illness, surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's probably a hooded athlete.
He used to ask where he was going to sit before shooting the next scene.
This time he rode a bike, climbed rocks and even went uphill.
All this in record tropical heat, the director said.
According to Bartoška, women marry a tiger to make him a rabbit over time.
They feed him a little, but they close the door so he doesn't think of playing tiger outside the rabbit house.
And that’s what we’re trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
His wife, who may seem slightly negative to viewers, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and means well.
But at the same time, she is a usurper and wants to roast her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film parallels the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and the sons-in-law Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers are Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google has pledged to provide an additional $5.5 million to organizations helping thousands of refugees pouring into Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, a charitable arm of the company.
Azerbaijan canceled part of Telička's visit for criticism of human rights violations.
Czech ANO MEP Pavel Telička postponed Thursday’s trip to Baku because Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
According to Telička, the reason for this is the European Parliament resolution last week, which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telička co-authored.
The decision of the Azerbaijani party Telička has deprived him of the opportunity to talk with official partners and also of the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
Telička wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive branch, as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners.
The resolution condemns the "unprecedented repression of civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after a recent verdict against Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadijah Ismailova, who has campaigned for the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building an air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out the possibility of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have any plans yet.
Nothing is out of the question, he said.
Russia already has a long-standing naval base in the port of Tartus, which until now has been used as a service and logistics center.
According to reports from the Russian press, deliveries of Russian weapons and military equipment to Syria have increased since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from current trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians intend to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which for now remains a stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, U.S. commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria, their third telephone conversation in 10 days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow to voice concerns about the build-up of Russia’s arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Moscow’s support for Assad was a lost bet.
He said Russia’s policy objectives in Syria were rather unclear.
Moscow has turned Syria into a satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a more long-term goal, but what that is, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria should be the main topic of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to Russian press speculation today.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not want to talk about the situation in Donbass.
According to a report in The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out the possibility that President Barack Obama might meet with the Russian president during a U.N. meeting.
Opinions among White House advisers are divided.
Citing Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the TASS news agency said that Putin has not yet scheduled a meeting with Obama on his New York residency program.
Sesame oil is used during the gallbladder diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When cold pressed from the seeds, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are good for preventing cardiovascular disease.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these have been the most common cause of death for Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, sesame oil helps.
If you are a lover of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of meals and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
Essential fatty acids, which it contains, are good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these problems 3 times more often than men.
In general, gallbladder problems mainly affect overweight people who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be successfully used in the liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should be wary of goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
However, the oil will lose all of its active ingredients, said Ladislav Hačecký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in the Sokolov region, which produces organic, cold-pressed virgin oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses only unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press can squeeze 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation of extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, nutrients would be lost.
Sunflower oil is beneficial for diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favourite among oils is sunflower.
Jarmila Hamerská, who led the research at Masaryk University, found that 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, already at 180 ° C it begins to overheat.
It is better to use it, for example, for seasoning salads and is especially useful in a diet in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which, of all fatty acids, reduce cholesterol levels the most.
In case of heart problems, you need to be careful about the amount of overall fat and calories.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
When it comes to the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
They are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to use extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last the same as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
Storage in the refrigerator will extend the shelf life.
Old oil is especially known for its bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no turbidity at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Hemp seeds are among the so-called superfoods, which is why hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body and must be ingested from food.
Omega 3 fatty acids are also important.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that it is one of the best-selling oils at Bohemia Oil.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often take one spoonful fasting in the morning.
Hemp oil is not very tasty, but it will greatly strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vlček from the Kraslice company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of barbecues are Americans.
There is 1.4 grill per household.
Various barbecue competitions are held all over the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not far behind either.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have not grilled in their lives.
The vast majority of them grill several times a year.
In order for the barbecue to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to prepare the meat by marinating a few hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is best for this, and at the same time it leaves beneficial substances in the barbecue?
In general, the process of grilling itself should save fat.
Experts agree that a large proportion of oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the beneficial substances that we get from them when eating oils from dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils cannot be used in barbecues.
Grape seed oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When meat is said, experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in the Sokolov region immediately recall grape oil.
It complements the taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen is characterized by a unique property of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216°C.
Even at such a high temperature, Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Olej, one of the few Czech producers of this grapevine oil, describes the health benefits of grape oil.
Experts agree that grape seed oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape seed oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, when seasoning salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
It can be used in two ways: marinating and grilling.
Marinating meat and fish will preserve their juiciness.
When preparing a marinade, three components must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
We add acidity, for example, with apple cider vinegar to soften the meat.
Spices in turn add flavor to the meat and oil preserves and adds the right zest, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, he adds that grape seed oil is ideal for marinating because it is one of the few oils that can penetrate through dark meat.
So marinated meat or fish are ready to grill, what to do next?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare dishes.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies especially to flaxseed, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the grate with oil to prevent food from burning.
An essential part of the barbecue is also the preparation of side dishes.
Practically anything goes with grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, a hot summer salad.
To do this, you need: - 1 piece of peach - 1 bunch of arugula - 1 cup of chopped cucumber - 1 cup of a mixture of lettuce leaves - 3 tablespoons of grape oil
In a salad bowl, add the shredded arugula, sliced cucumbers, and chopped peach to the salad leaf mixture.
Season with salt and pepper to taste, and add the ground chilli and soy sauce.
Drizzle with a few drops of grape seed oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it is not only the medication that matters, but also the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, care for these patients includes social-legal advice, recommendations for adjusting housing, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can fundamentally affect the patient himself.
The more she actively fights the disease, the longer she can work and does not have to fundamentally change her lifestyle.
As the doctors point out, the passivity of patients frees up space for disease activity.
For example, it has been proven that regular exercise significantly delays the time when the patient needs some compensatory aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subjected to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That is why the Give Yourself a Chance website (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give Yourself a Chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In the case of multiple sclerosis, there is a saying twice that the earlier the disease is treated, the more likely it is to affect the doctor.
This is because we have multiple sclerosis drugs in the inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not yet as strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the chance that we will be able to stop the disease and delay disability, explains Dr. Eva Medová from the Neurology Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important for people with multiple sclerosis, which most often addresses weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, reduce swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient," says Martina Kovari, MD, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine at Motol University Hospital.
Although people with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, it manifests itself in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation can not stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, physical activity also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is that patients check what they can do, and this strengthens their confidence.
"Exercise also leaches endorphins and one feels good after it," points out PhDr. Kamila Řasová from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University Hospital Královské Vinohrady.
By affecting the physical side, we affect the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We directly interfere with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients were so-called sparing, today we know that they need a targeted load," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine Clinic at Motol University Hospital.
The goal of physiotherapy is to be able to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including at work.
Physiotherapists therefore cooperate with occupational therapists so that each person receives a compensation aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people shake it.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
It must respond to a great burden - the loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we should go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to eventually come to the conclusion that even with a disability one can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurology Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, airplanes would not fly.
Aviation production is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
New aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials, which can not be produced and processed right away.
Yet, in addition to super-precision, computer-controlled machine tools, along with autoclaves for shaping composites, it is possible to come across something as ordinary as apricot stones.
In the drum, which resembles a cotton candy pot, the edges of the sheet metal parts that just came out of the milling machine are plastered in a pile of pits.
"No one has come up with anything better yet," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the aircraft door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
On the premises in Prague Letňany Letov produces complete doors for Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
Passengers entering the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world’s largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380, also enter through the doors, part of which is assembled in Prague.
There are also composite doors for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the company has the torque wrenches adjusted twice a year.
If the yellow sticker is missing a record of the inspection, they should explain in the Prague plant to auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who regularly travel to check whether the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
However, advanced technology has not completely replaced the human senses.
There are 1,500 rivets on one door to the A320.
The riveters have to shake them by hand.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the hammer hitting, they will know if the rivet is already shaken correctly.
The tolerance in which they operate is minimal.
Rivets can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's about twice the thickness of a human hair.
During the inspection comes a trained touch.
When a controller runs his finger over a row of rivets, he can tell if one is out of tolerance.
Then he picks up the exact dial.
Before 1989, Letov supported the L-39 military training aircraft program.
In 1991, none of them were built.
The company had to find new contracts quickly.
At the time, it was partnered with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won a tender for the emergency door supplier for the A321.
The Boeing deal wasn't so happy.
“We were a small company that didn’t have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable deliveries,” Dubský said.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained slammed if Letov had not attracted the French Latecoere group at the Prague conference of the international aviation industry association in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
Negotiations with the French began the next day, Dubsky said.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
The assembly of door parts for the A320 started in 2000.
Three years later, the upper deck doors for the A380 were added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall to supply Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we would not be able to get these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we'd make parts or small parts.
The partners want a guarantee of delivery for twenty or thirty years, Dubský explains.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved turnover of over 2.9 billion and profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position among the suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 specific production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company would not have built any aircraft doors.
According to Dubský, it costs millions of crowns to obtain certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers and to keep them in repeated inspections.
Production processes change every year.
They are more precise and strict.
We have to train the employees, retrofit the equipment and re-certify the whole process, Dubský adds.
Now, the company is finalizing the process for zinc and nickel plating to replace the previously harmful cadmium.
They received the assignments from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people from Boeing will come and test the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll also check our lab.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, explains Dubský the way the customers check them.
The reward is Prague company’s long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant, embraer production stands and falls today.
For the A320, it produces half of the total volume of the doors.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
However, this does not mean that you can ask for any price at the door.
The contract includes a price curve.
This indicates how much one door will cost by ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces.
The price per piece keeps falling to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price formula.
If not, we will lose, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall where the electric boxes for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are assembled is empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
A new semi-robotic riveting and door assembly line is being built behind the screen for the upgraded A320 Neo.
Riveting will speed up and refine.
"This is the trend that assembly in aviation is taking," adds Dubský.
The future line is secured.
Airbus has ordered 3,278 new A320s so far.
Just a few meters away will be a line for the complete installation of the doors for the upper deck of the A380.
It is the strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, Dubský says.
Before that, however, the company has to pass qualification tests, for example, to mount some electrical and electronic equipment in the doors for the largest Airbus.
The company also relies on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it is also expected to participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
“It is a huge credit for the company to be able to process composites in addition to metal materials,” Dubský proudly says.
However, Latecoere is on the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no more room in the Letov area, where it is located.
The company had 180 employees before the French mother's accession.
Now it has 800, and in three years there could be hundreds more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are racing to see how many hundreds of new planes they order each year, they don’t have to worry about jobs.
Although he has orders for several years ahead, the parent company of Prague’s Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for September loan repayments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with major lenders.
At the end of August, some of the loans were exchanged for shares.
Creditors acquired a share of 37.4% in the company by raising 57.4 million euros.
The company’s debt fell by two-thirds, i.e. by 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company signed new shares among existing shareholders for 222.9 million euros.
In total, it increased the registered capital by 280 million euros.
The group benefits from growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
Average order growth is expected to increase by 4% per year until 2017.
In the order book, he has orders for 2.6 billion euros, which is equivalent to four years of production.
French media say Latecoere may finally be able to breathe again after years on the drips.
The Czech race in Letňany in Prague is important for groups.
It contributes 16% to the group’s sales.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
They supported a greater share of the state’s coal taxes.
The change in fees for mining is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets should have a neutral impact, because the fee should be higher.
Last year, municipalities received CZK 450 million in fees and the state budget CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal cost municipalities about CZK 200 million and the state CZK 66 million.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the payment from mining premises with permitted mining to one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to belong to municipalities in its entirety.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that municipalities will gain CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million per year instead of CZK 14 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be set by the government by its regulation.
Reimbursement is newly calculated as the product of the amount of minerals mined and the rate for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by government decree may not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax because the state charges for the mineral, which is state property.
Fees are paid only to municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of underground coal mining, three-quarters of the municipality’s money and a quarter of the state’s.
The same ratio will be in the case of the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money collected by the state in mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The draft was criticised today by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would harm communities affected by mining and regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and the Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to have the finance minister improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.
KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned about the rise in unemployment in Mostek.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent long-term negotiated.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, in her view, the increase in fees is acceptable in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur on the amendment, Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial for MPs to know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government’s decision on the limits of coal mining before the law is passed.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have impacts on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak Army should be made only after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken due to social, economic and long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Time to Decide on Interest Rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The entire world is watching as the US Federal Reserve prepares to meet Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for a while longer, leaving interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates," says Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, recovering by adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global perspective.
They have warned markets to be prepared for the increase, but circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against this move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
A gunman at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot and killed his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday and later that day, wrote a note saying he was “sorry” for the first murders and that he wished he could take it back.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called police on Monday morning around 10 a.m.
He said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send officers to his house.
He said, “I shot my wife last night,” and also mentioned that there was a “cute dog” in the house that “won’t bother anyone” but was upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was shot.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamb saying, “I’m so sorry and wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who's ever loved me."
After leaving a note, Lamb went on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University Dean William LaForge said he knew of no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was obviously something going on in Mr Lamb's head".
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities said there was "no evidence" of a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person".
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but both remained friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was "shaken" throughout the case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss' close friend, as reported by the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help others,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he "will not go to jail".
When police caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to a biography posted on the school's website, Lamb earned a doctorate in education from Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who have lost their magic
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
He battled leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
All of these things are certainly taking their toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender has left this injury in tears and put him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless intervention in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw made his way into the PSV space.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes, and an oxygen mask was also needed before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double fracture to his leg and is now in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then he will continue to operate in Manchester.
It's terrible - the guy who comes to Manchester at 18 has it very hard, but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he plays again this season.
Moreno was very lucky that he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian umpire was mistaken.
You can judge for yourself if it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure with both feet.
A tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my road to recovery starts now and I will come back even stronger."
Manchester United injury to Luke Shaw in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have an added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
The goal is never to hurt our players.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention wasn't to hurt an opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I wasn’t able to see this moment.
I only saw the ball going in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn’t see the intervention on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about this, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's intervention.
David Cameron knows The Lorax better.
Every parent knows this: when a child loves a book, it doesn’t take long to learn it by heart.
You must not be David Cameron.
When asked by a children's scheme provider to name a favorite children's book, Prime Minister Lorax chose a 1971 fable by Dr. Seuss.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report posted on SuperCamps' website, and continues, "Funny, touching, creative, and with strong content, that's what I liked to read to my kids because there was always a picture or message behind it that I hadn't seen before."
Well, except in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the plot of the book from a 2012 film that added additional characters and details to fill in the brief original text.
"In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of her dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," is the brief content of the book, which records the object of love unknown Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that weren't suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameron reads like a summary excerpt of the Lorax film, found on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins with the words, "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Being an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would become familiar with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being devastated by the avaricious, tree-cutting industrialist Once-ler, who despite the protests of the title Lorax, a crouched, musty creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively minor PR task was given to a helper who had never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text most likely came from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was at risk of neglecting England, but he still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team England has chosen for this tour, I think it will be unlikely to repeat the 3-0 defeat she suffered in the last test series.
I wouldn't rule out winning guests either.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting line-up, and the collective thinking is strong; they won’t carry the 2012 scars, just youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is an emerging spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the trial series level, represents an attacking option.
Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is a tough one for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in challenging conditions and a simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged on performance.
For example, there were no question marks around the Joe Root name, which led to the announcement because - and I've said this before - players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century, and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, another opportunity will emerge.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performances were not exactly one hundred percent, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time a batsman gets to show up is a tough one.
Lyth was given seven caps - just like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton earned nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and away.
The only thing you might be grinning about is that England gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean first - even though Lyth was in top form - but this missed opportunity is now in the past.
Here comes Alex Hales, and he's a batsman that I rate very positively.
He’s the x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he won 236 against us on Trent Bridge, which he kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all of this will of course depend on the overall line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook getting another extra spinner while maintaining four quicks has been floated, and I have no objection to it.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't bat and this left-handed man has already shown that he is an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and there's not much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his appearance in 2001.
He succeeded for three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow him, he caught my attention as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats -- an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and I see that as slingshots, but there aren't a lot of spinners to raise their hands, and the selectors have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
Appointing Mahel Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a trial match consultant can be a championship move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring a wealth of experience by having experience with all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings both energy and ruthless sparkle to the team.
I have always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes was given a one-day break, just like Root was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that decision.
While many disagree on this, coaches and selectors do not create a schedule.
And you need to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron’s ill-conceived renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble every day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn to the head of the Workers’ Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some member states have had enough of Britain's egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which they mostly did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided they didn't want it even if they eroded social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home saying they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unconcerned Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they don't care about us leaving.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s prudently balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with the too long-running Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's Francois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to watch them break their legs in helping Selfie Britons who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they themselves do not want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
"Renegotiation solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from negotiations."
Europeans know to their detriment how predatory Fleet Street can be and how sceptical of the EU the press oligarchs are because they were not at the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975 that supported our entry in 1973 by a 2:1 margin.
They may vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, a sly Euro-opportunist who made his name as Brussels' "EU straight bananas" correspondent in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-free rascals, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo-non-overseas departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a frantic gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her so she doesn't take you out to dinner and then to tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum routine, ever since Blair admitted the principle of the abolished EU Constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and got him a firing card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he couldn't waste any more time on me - seems in danger of re-adopting the Murdoch boycott strategy of Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC chair he left on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, to put it mildly, evolving.
He said he would like to stay in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the frantic tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly agree to it.
That's what Hilary "Bemm but not Benniite" Benn said on both radio and television this week when his inner scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbyn's appointment of an abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his grandfather fought on TV for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "in all circumstances" - Benna's platitudes - apparently wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of all-day television and especially in the whirlwind, the hotbed of paranoia and betrayal that is social media.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to take the Workers’ Party’s support in the referendum campaign for granted, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell’s and Corbyn’s basic prevarications about EU membership, in line with their Bennite besieging economy, their anti-capitalist past, are no longer just a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is central to dogmatic bickering.
As with his spin on Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be required to try to understand the meaning of all this for their landlords.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions when it seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed with Britain's "weak military output in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in cutting costs to the Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts Criticize Review of Electronic Published by Public Health England
The agency’s statement that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are connected to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in its e-cigarette report by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published a "marginal" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the vastness of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet last month attacked the "extremely flimsy base" on which PHE was basing its main conclusions.
Two other experts writing for the BMJ questioned the claims, which were reportedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said, "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They state that the public could expect PHE's claims, which read "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop an analysis of the multi-criteria (MCDA) model's decision to synthesize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly had previously raised funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also endorsed the public health mandate of BAT in the sustainability report, it states.
One of the 12 participants admitted funding from an electronic cigarette maker, but not funding he had allegedly received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they do contain several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also claim industry funding in the paper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The PHE meeting was also attended by tobacco executives.
The report, produced in this group, "speakfully admits," the lack of "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a smoking route for children or non-smokers" was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the claim in the BMJ had been answered before.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifetime smokers will die because of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS $2 billion per year.
By clearly highlighting the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give a right hand" for hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs that are likely to be watched by only a handful of people, into complex broadcast times versus his rivals' biggest ratings shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had unsuccessfully sought a connection with the BBC for the six years he had worked on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state input," Johnson told the House of Commons Communications Commission, as part of negotiations over the future of the BBC.
If you maintain licensing fees, which I am not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, the creation should be reduced at least in terms of programs that do not produce or outsource others.
They broadcast The Voice prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and understandably meaningless.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without a contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
Other channels would give them their right hand.
I can't understand how these are a public service broadcaster.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC in the least.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty about catching up on ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed this was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows repeats those of Sky's former executive, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the BBC's more pampered public service programs "go to BBC4, where quite often you can't measure the audience, but they fulfill their authority and can argue as they prepare for their hypocritical mission of justifying the ?4bn revenue from royalties, "But of course we do all these obscure programs that nobody is looking at."
They broadcast them at a time when no one is looking at them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the commission, "I urge you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think 150 pounds a year is a big sum, but for people who are 150 pounds a lot, I’d be surprised if they paid that much, because they don’t watch the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, speaking before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that the BBC's small production volume was now previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% on radio - and should take public broadcasting in Australia and Canada as a role model and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like Proms, of which only a handful have been aired on television, and connect with commercial reporters so we can see them all online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which nematodes move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small nematodes change direction when they are struck by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists Can Read and Write Brain Activity Using Light
The researchers said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrodes are injected into the patient’s brain to stimulate the brain.
The sentinels usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when they are placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found, the bubbles amplify the ultrasound waves, which then pass through the body of the worms.
Amplified ultrasound waves act in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are associated with, according to a Nature Communications report.
To control the nematodes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then used ultrasound on the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is similar in many ways to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light.
However, Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also be used in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements denigrating the British arms trade.
Watch a video about the anti-gun market from Amnesty International.
Horrible killer drones!
Ankle-breaking legs!
Fragmentary missiles!
And electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and caricature of the metaphor leave no doubt that this ad at the world’s biggest gun fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the UK government’s willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes via the defence and security facilities of International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands district.

But a separate campaign is also being conducted with posters popping up at bus stops and subways that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Travelling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using the lettering with London Underground signs with DLR lines becoming the image of the tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DLR...Customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are created by artists exhibiting their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute them all over London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is a $6 per piece Allen key that supposedly "gets access to roughly a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and an assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the galleries.
Many artists transition to working with activists within protest movements, realizing that they need to get out in the real world in order for their art to impact society.
Another one of the posters against about the arms trade health passengers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video was viewed by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by VCCP, a royalty-free agency, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the arms trade ads - he saw a blank on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were toying with creating a more realistic risky corporate ad, but "by adding bright colors and animation, we made it attract more people."
“They have done a fantastic job and helped raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the trade fair,” said Tom Davies, Amnesty’s Director of Research.
What we now need is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that torture equipment is not traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military for "an AT4CS RS launch arm."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
The Eight Golden Rules for Living in a Student Dormitory
11 years ago, I moved to college as an oblivious 19-year-old, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the strained smiles of those I bothered to put up with - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the tracks can range from mild to nerve-racking to totally appalling.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, if you've taken a year off, what you think of Corbyn, and why "you don't really love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just yeast extract HAHA, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask and show interest.
It drives the conversation and helps you find the people you love and the ones you wouldn't even talk to if your eyelashes were on fire and they were putting out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking receptions, movie night venues, and communal public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about going to college while you’re in a relationship
Introverts go to college.
Your room should be a refuge, yet a lot of dormitories are turning into an out-of-the-room walking culture that is friendly, sociable, and conducive to lifelong friendships.
This can be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to recognize when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
One of the guys in my dorm used to be invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Because you started going to college at the height of the baking mania, knocking on someone else's door and putting on a show with a plate of baked cookies seems a little less weird, less like "Welcome to the neighborhood, I made you something to eat, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you, and maybe everything will end up assigning your face to a delicious surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and lead are likely to interrupt others pretending to sleep when you try to knock on their doors.
Theft of food is a common crime in student dorms.
Stealing a whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea a theft?
Check with the owner of the milk twice.
There is a chance that they will offer you milk even if they are raging inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more maturely than my roommate, who swapped her milk for dishwashing detergent to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make noises that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
A girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn down the drum and bass a little, because it was 3 a.m. and she had a test in the morning.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When they finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours and then turned on her own music loud, locked the door and left for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse went to the same college as you?
And conversely, wouldn't it be terribly embarrassing if you mistook your roommate for your future wife, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe take control of your mutual friends as well?
Of course, you can't command your heart - but if your sexy roommate isn't 100% your future spouse, try talking to your weaknesses at least a little bit.
In the uplifting moment when you realize that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, there is only a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never ruin someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put their keys in a bottle of water, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva looked forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a hard time during her pregnancy with 7-year-old Vítek.
His father broke up with her and was alone to prepare and raise the offspring.
I dealt with the situation quite quickly - I was very looking forward to the baby and I was looking for the positives in it.
I tried not to worry about insecurity and being alone with the baby.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not be alone for long, Eva recalls today her first pregnancy.
Already then she met on the Internet on the chat older Vašek, with whom they began to talk about their favorite movies.
Vašek even brought Eva and Vítek home from the maternity ward, but he did not play the role of stepfather.
"He then withdrew from the program for some time," Eva described in the documentary series Four in the Three.
The motif of the third season of the Czech television series is the search for happiness on the second try.
She was able to take care of Vítek and the financial security of her family thanks to her part-time work and great help from her mother and her aunt.
In the end, even the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child did not spoil Vašek’s affection for Eve.
They finally got together around Vítek’s second birthday and he now understands Vašek as his dad and calls him that.
Even though Vašek already has two adult daughters, he says he enjoys paternity at sixty and he also devotes more time to his children.
In addition to Vítek, two-year-old Leontýnka and eventually twins joined them.
"Yours came into our family somehow naturally, perhaps because my mother never talked much into my relationships," she said.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
Twins Ema and Ela were born by Caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of the pregnant woman and manifest themselves mainly by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth usually spontaneously disappears.
Ema and Ela were born healthy to Eva and Vašek, even though they were only at 36 weeks.
Emička was placed in an incubator at an intermediate department, where Vašek’s niece works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after the transfer from the ICU to the room I had her with me, describes the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent 20 days in the hospital until the doctors agreed to release the babies, who had managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
Waiting for the babies in the maternity ward did not make Eve happy.
“I was mad about my husband and my children,” recalls a four-times mother in the six-times ward.
She and her husband also considered signing a reversal, among other things because of the insensitive attitude of one of the doctors.
However, this did not happen, and the doctors released Eva and the twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
A large family can be humbled.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric double burner and cramped conditions.
The house did not grow, but Vašek made Eva happy by installing a gas cooker to make the preparation of food for six people more comfortable.
If the weather gets worse, we'll take a taxi.
Eva is convinced that the children perceive especially the family well-being and pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or sobriety of the house.
So far, we've put together very nicely, better than we expected.
Although the mess is harder to hide in a small space and we sometimes cross the crumbling babies, but at least we are all close, smiles Eva, who is able to find a positive side to every situation.
Vašek's work as a lighting worker in film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That’s why he sometimes goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, he says he is physically able to take care of his family and children’s finances, but how long will that be?
"I realize that due to our age difference, it will one day be me who will feed this family," Eva admits frankly when asking about the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not much of an employer.
And if the worst comes to worst, my husband and I can take a taxi ride, a sympathetic blonde jokes.
Apple has a yo-yo effect.
It's all the displays.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a firmer chassis, and a touch-sensitive display are the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
So far, Apple’s trend has been that each new generation of iPhones is lighter than the previous one.
The only exceptions were the third and fourth generation, whose weight slightly increased compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in favor of the news was really negligible.
This is not the case with the new iPhones.
Compared to last year’s iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams for a smaller model, and by 20 grams for a larger one.
Unsurprisingly, last year’s affair of bending in Apple’s pockets suffered greatly.
The chassis of the novelty is made of a more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which is also reflected in the weight.
But displays have a much greater impact on it.
Apple uses 3D Touch technology to recognize the power of touch.
To do this, the display had to be equipped with an additional layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the new iPhone displays has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone, from 12 grams to 29 grams, for a larger iPhone, from 19 grams to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s, the display is the heaviest component used.
The weight of just 143 grams is achieved thanks to the slimming bark, which has touched most of the remaining components.
In a larger model, the heaviest element used is the battery, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is seen in the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus is 192 grams.
As much as the new display technology will be practical, it will only take effect during use.
First users will be able to try it on Friday, September 25, when the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Have breakfast flakes been champions for tens of thousands of years?
In Grotta Paglicci, Italy, archaeologists have managed to find a find that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of modern human settlement from different times, including murals, remnants of tools, and so on and so forth.
But in layer 23A, which according to the instruments is dated to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something that closely resembles the remains of a breakfast buffet.
Traces of oat grains were found on the site, which apparently went through the process of making today's so popular flakes.
Today, the grain is first soaked, then dried, removed from the packaging, called the plum, then steamed and flattened.
In the Paglicci cave, grains were discovered that seemed to have been heated or steamed, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least there are signs of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, scientists have not been able to prove in their publication for the journal PNAS that there is a complete process of making flakes in the cave, but the similarity is really very noticeable.
We also have no evidence of how humans could have eaten flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly even warm is, of course, quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have overtaken agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New reports of stations in the Transport Company of the City of Brno.
So once again I listened to the names of the trolleybus stops: Hnusáčkova, Přívězd, Frazova, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolleybus was a bit louder, so the message in a male voice was a bit less understandable than before when the stops were reported in a female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of the traffic is more recognizable than the deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I do not know who, nobody asked me, but they certainly chose it from studio recordings made in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I have been living in Brno for several decades now, so I know the correct names of all these stops by heart, so I do not need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere who are not familiar with Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended may be confused and may claim that the stop at which they were supposed to get off was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of the announcer - but better again of the announcer - should be made again, and this time underscored by the normal traffic noise and the rumble of the engine, in which the buzzing of the loudspeaker on the bus is almost lost.
So that we no longer have to listen to the names of the stations Water Heršpice, Šmírov, or then Immersion in a squeaking hall, to which I transferred in Komárov.
I suppose my old hearing didn't get so bad all of a sudden on the same day that the caller stops changed.
Before that day, I understood the reports pretty well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the track logs.
Today, few people know what the biggest and smartest tests were under the party’s rule.
I took the liberty of remembering.
The bus was late.
I ran into the dispatcher's office at the moment when the radio said it was just seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't collide with your comrade chief, he came a minute before you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher remarked as I checked into the Arrivals Book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I'm going to the precincts for a minor mechanization review.
I can't do that. It's a background check today.
They're all fucked up, to the point of horror.
What's going on?
"You'll see," said the dispatcher.
Next time, you'll be too.
I ran out into the hallway.
The door opened and the chief appeared.
Uptight, stone-faced, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Mr. Chief," I said respectfully, quickly buttoning two buttons of uniform jacket.
“Good morning,” came the reply, and I hurried up to the second floor without realizing the cold, ominous tone the old man had given.
"You're playing," said the engineer Eva, an elderly lady whom I held in high esteem.
He said she was even the chief before the comrades deposed her.
There's a background check, and you're gonna be there.
How many times have I asked what the comprehensive background checks are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They say they go once every three years, they all have to go, and it's pretty annoying.
At least for some.
I'll see about that.
I pulled out the file with the periodic reports and then the phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me now," said the chief's voice.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met and nothing ..." I muttered, but no one answered me, each with his own thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I've come at your command," I said, barely entering the chieftain's office.
The chief sat at his desk, looking at some paper.
"Comrade Mechanizer," he said after a while, without raising his head and still carefully examining the paper, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the sheet on the table, leaned back into the back of the chair, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly look.
I was confused.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised the fact that during the few months in office I worked very well and that he is very happy with me.
The chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon at a distance.
And now this?
Realize that you are a track distance technician and you have to behave accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I stammered that I had used such a greeting since childhood, that I was so brought up and that I did not see anything wrong with it.
For a chief, it was like a red turkey rag.
“You’re on a socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is an honor to work,” the chief said.
And besides, you're still confusing calling your superiors.
One time you say "sir" and the next time you say "comrade."
I'm not the boss, I'm the boss.
The deputies are comrades deputies, the chief trackmasters are comrades chief trackmasters!
Kindly remember that!
I'm sorry, sir... Comrade Chief, but... I greeted you with an ordinary civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and it's an honor to work, or comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
“It’s not your privilege not to be on the side,” said the cold chief, who had calmed down a little.
We'll talk about it later.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a pre-retirement chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his preference, things didn't look good with the man.
He stabbed me for a moment with a cold, prickly look, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his condescending manner.
He was only a few years older, and he was playing God, in fact, a comrade god.
Jolly, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, as it suits him at the moment.
He's been pooped.
Well, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, as all party members, but also non-partisans, was like him.
But the chief had many, especially those with whom he could assert his superiority.
He just wiped me out for total bullshit.
I thought about my ass, and it cost me enough to not shoot him in the face.
But I wouldn’t go back to being a truck driver, let alone a truck driver.
What would I feed two kids?
And a house under construction!
I was crying, but I controlled myself.
I won't make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," said the chief, closing the audience and beginning to look at the paper he had held before.
I was called in at 11:30.
Everyone in the office was already there, and to the questions of what and how, they said that it would be good.
Only Jožin said bitingly, as was his custom, that they could not fire us all, because comrade chief himself and his loyal ones would have to do the job, and that there was no danger.
He emphasized the word "comrade" as if he knew what the old man had wiped me for this morning.
There was a nice gathering in the chieftain's office.
Comrade chief at his desk and at the long advisory table other comrades who were to decide my official existence or non-existence.
A cadre, the chairman of ROH, a staff writer, a special-purpose officer, a sort of military checkpoint, and a deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the gravel.
An ordinary track worker, tamping sleepers or throwing gravel with pitchforks.
But also a former guard.
There was a rumor that he wasn't funny at the time, that he was a good-looking beast.
Bad languages claimed that the school came out in the seventh grade, he did not learn anything, he did not know anything.
And when he got out of jail, he ended up on a pickaxe.
But comrade, that's right, comrade was forged!
The chief motioned for me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an indigestible donut in my throat.
Kádrovák read the report from the civic committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, I have two children, and so on and so forth.
So far so good, I thought, and I was breathing a little better.
Then a review from the party's street organization.
He copied the Citizen's Report, perhaps both were written by the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of long-time members of the party refused to appear before the review committee and subsequently withdrew from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The man noticed and stopped reading.
The chief told him to continue.
It just got worse.
I was a member of the SSM city committee and there I was won as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who left the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and besides the National Committee, I had a wedding at the church.
I failed the party in the worst way.
That's why I've been removed from her list of candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even to my mother, when she died, I arranged a church funeral, although she was a former member of the party.
All of this shows a negative attitude towards the leadership of the party.
When he finished reading, only the chief's pencil tapping the table top interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone stared at me, and I wished I was far away.
At the same time, I kept saying to myself, "Communists - supermen, communists - supermen." What have I gotten myself into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I was able to fix the switches without some fucking background check.
But now?
She took the career of a railroad official before she started.
Return to platoon?
I don't think so. The chief's gonna fire me for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you examine the comrade here?" interrupted the tense silence by asking for a cadre.
Well, according to a review from a previous job.
Do you have it here?
There was no sign of him.
He looked up at her, as if he had been alone in the room.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief some paper.
"Well," said the chief, with a hint of joviality, which, however, was often a harbinger of a storm.
At first glance, all praise, trained with honors, graduated from industrial school, worked as a locksmith in the task wage, met the standard on average one hundred and twenty percent.
But the important thing is missing.
Where did you get the report, comrade?" he turned again to the cadre, who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him and that he might not even be a cadre very soon.
The comrade here gave it to me when I got in.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he came in, he went to the precinct in the platoon," blinked the cadre.
And there are no reviews required, his was kind of extra, so I put him in a file.
"So when you were assigned to a technical function, this piece of paper was enough for you," the chief said dryly.
The cadaver blinked nervously and had no answer.
"It's all right, we'll discuss it later," the chief concluded, and the cadre was apparently relieved.
For now, he's holding up.
"What about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
Suddenly I feel like it's over!
It was dark in my eyes, hot in my eyes.
There followed a torrent of reproaches and accusations, and I knew I was the most hideous creature in the world, not worthy of the slightest mercy.
I misled a comrade cadre officer by slipping an incomplete report, and I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I received it from the cadre in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element who, at the time of building real socialism, supports and even participates in religious obscurantism.
That there was a lot that I did, or maybe I still do, and I silently prayed for it to end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I flew out of my mechanic's place.
I didn't care if they took my pickpocket.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people as I was in the eyes of comrade chief.
"That's enough, comrade chief," said the party leader suddenly, interrupting the chief's Levites forcefully.
He made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, what a stupid thing to do!
He has already received his punishment.
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to the side for a while!
In order to open to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is again worthy of our trust.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did that come from?
Is he so well-read or parroting phrases from party trainings and meetings?
That is why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who is to give it to him, if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to reform!
It's your partisan duty that no one can relieve you of!
Actually, it's a party duty for all of us.
He must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That, as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but she also loves.
When the president was finished, no one looked up.
No one expected such a turn of events.
At least me.
"I completely agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the Chief said ice-coldly in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd have heard that's the conclusion I was coming to.
They all nodded their heads in agreement, but they could see that he didn’t believe a word.
"So I was confirmed for the position of an independent care officer for basic resources," I shrieked as I returned to the office and immediately cried.
Well, except for engineer Eva, they were all at lunch.
She listened silently to my incoherent recounting of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked if I would like a cup of coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the stove and prepared cups.
In the meantime, she's been talking about cadre practices.
How one opinion, often full of praise, is put in the hand of a man, and the other, in which there is some dirt, is sent to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but on a pickaxe, so the factory comrades didn't know where to send it.
And our caddy?
He only cares where he would eat or drink, and so it turned out, how it turned out.
"He'll get it from the old man," she remarked maliciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Be careful with him anyway, he's pretty vindictive.
And the party president?
In fact, a much worse chief, no philanthropist.
Zero from a pickaxe with a lot of power.
The water began to boil, and then the office was filled with the smell of coffee that had just been poured.
I threw a sugar cube into the cup and silently stirred the hot potion.
I hope I'm out of the woods.
I won't be fired now, and I won't have another background check for three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief won't let me forget today.

The symbol of the village has come alive.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum is turning again after years.
It can be seen from afar, as it is located on a 15-meter-high mast.
People from all over the world call it "the wind on Chlum".
For the village with 150 inhabitants, it became one of the elements of the municipal coat of arms that the village received on the occasion of the reunion of natives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at that time and of course we wanted to have a fan on the sign, everyone knows it around," Mayor Jiří Mašek said.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a memento of our time: it reminds us of a time when people were fighting for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the representatives of Chlum decided on a solution that was suitable until the mid-1980s.
A seven-meter deep well was dug in the village at the branch to Číchov.
Three years later, the well was completed with a metal structure with a wind pump, which drew water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc of Hranice na Moravě at a cost of 2,400 crowns," says a memorial inscription on the ground-floor fence of the mast structure.
The pump, after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel, was retired in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter in the struggle for water began: on that day, a new water supply system began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump has remained only a non-functional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
Dominance was put into operation at this year's native convention.
It was not until 2008 that Chlumští decided to repair the wind bike again and put it back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - reduced by an average of half a meter.
The wheel was mounted on the mast, but had to be brought down the same year.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel could not resist the gusts of wind.
Then the Chlum landmark rested for several years dismantled under the roof.
Since June this year, however, the wheel on the high mast is turning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the natives, the village had the replica of the bicycle modified and replanted it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel only draws utility water from the well into the overflowing blind arm.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected it, because there was not enough water in the well.
At least it was empty.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the wind wheel shaft from the pump in the suction basket again," said Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the wind bike has been included in the municipal coat of arms, but it is the only village of this kind in the whole Vysočina region.
They have a similar element in the coat of arms in honor of local technical monuments, for example, in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in the Vyškov region, in Kuželov in the Hodonín region, Partutovice in the Přerovsk region, or in the Police in the Vsetín region.
No offense, but I don't know Lafata, the Tripoli supporter Goian admitted.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone else in my career," 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-match press conference.
We were coached by Georghe Hagi at the time, it was a shame that we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
“We’re not going to lose this time,” Goian said.
This man, who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team, is a key support for the Greek team.
As a hitchhiker, he will face raids by the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Spartan Hybsh about the Greek duel.
He knows what to expect on Thursday night.
I know Fatai well, who played in Romanian Astra with my brother Luciano.
I watched all of their games at the time.
"I know he's a very good striker, that's why he went to Sparta," Goian said.
He did not name any other footballers of the Prague club, so he asked directly if he knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and with a slightly reproachful look aimed at Czech journalists.
The look on his face said, “Why are you asking me this?”
After a moment of silence, he started.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of teams.
He has really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know this very well about Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, we can say that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is their organizer of the game," observed Stanislav Hejkal, Sparta's assistant.
Goian has already had his best years, but he can boast a very interesting football biography.
He was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but from Steauy headed to Palermo, Italy, he also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, they regularly play European Cups, they fight for victory in the Czech league.
For me, he is the favourite in this match, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in a room with Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very much looking forward to competing from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But on behalf of the whole team, we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic and is considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should be in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading shares of the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a group headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a real impact on the company, says Daniel Buryš, CFO of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the Group's headquarters, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry on the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is finalizing a prospectus of the security, which will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the seat of the holding and the related share transfers will take the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating.
Consequently, no subscription shares will be offered to the public or to new investors in the course of this operation.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so choose - at a later date, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has said in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Czech Television's Objectivity Test in Reporting on the Migrant Crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the mainstream Czech media coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time the main news broadcast of Czech Television.
And how did she do?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can play today’s broadcast of the Czech Television Event.
The migrant crisis was devoted to about 80% of broadcast news.
Until the first minute, when the Czech Television reported on the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and called the attacks of migrants on police officers euphemistically out of patience - throwing stones and attacking with metal rods), the current pro-migrant propaganda was already going - judge for yourself the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-profit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
The term “refugee” is used consistently by refugees, not migrants.
What is particularly striking is that CT consistently uses only images of young children and women in the illustrative footage.
She said in the same broadcast that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that has no parallel from communist agitation.
As a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
Once upon a time, when I grew up on a block of flats, I soon ceased to be the only inhabitant.
I've got fishnets moving in on my mascara toilet.
Fish, insects with imperfect transformation, i.e., not undergoing the transition from caterpillar to beetle and chick looks like an adult, only it is small and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't hesitate to kill them.
First by hand and then chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some kind of blue crystals for their disposal.
I think it was called Zyklon B.
Or something else?
However, it was successfully eliminated.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with a sort of juvenalizer that the ants brought into the nest and he then did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But that's what I've turned away from.
As time passed, insects became objects of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to think that they had the same right to life as we humans.
What’s more, I’ve learned from life that interfering with an ecosystem doesn’t lead to success, and one pest can replace another.
Truth in fleas and bedbugs, I wouldn't hesitate to aggravate my karma by killing them.
In the new residence, my partner and I agreed that if the fishponds do not crawl down our throats, let them eat the chips of renegade skin, some invisible algae and so on.
Their peaceful existence was disturbed over time by a spider.
It was a common kind of streetman who lived on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he lived off of occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only made us more comfortable.
Because he spent several years with us, we found out that he feeds mainly on ponds and that he apparently kept their number tolerable.
By intimate regular contact with every need we have found out that it is a female.
We have seen romantic courtship with a partner about a third smaller than that, carefully strumming on the web fibers so that he is not eaten before he reaches the coveted copulation.
It took about three days for them not to move or react to our checks.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
After that, the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging around.
They soon disappeared.
They were bitten by their mother, bitten by others.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went elsewhere or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
That's right, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the original bathroom dweller.
For some time she watched our behavior cautiously from the ceiling and moved under the toilet bowl to evaluate our non-aggression as friendship.
Again, the number of fish has decreased and the spider has been quietly minding its normal activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn’t changed in a year.
In the meantime, our daughter has grown to an age where potty use has become a disgrace.
So far, we have tolerated it, but the eternal spilling of its contents has already eaten us.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more.
However, the daughter found an excuse to maintain her bad habit in the spider, which she could see very well when wiping.
Our talk about seeing the spider didn't take any luck in the house.
Crying and screaming, she forced her potty.
There was no need.
There was a moment when the spider had to command itself, for the sake of the developmental shift of the daughter.
It was up to me.
He was caught in a glass and banished across the balcony into the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but after living together for so long, I still felt like I was throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the ponds would start to appear more often and begin to multiply with a geometric series.
For a week or two, there was no one there.
I began to speculate on the cause.
I was wondering if the ants-like spider had grown them there, that the environment of the toilet was not as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they swarmed again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their attachment to the spider must have been due to the fact that if they did not see it, it was hidden somewhere else and they were in danger from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some sort of telepathic connection to their predator, and his quick disappearance triggered some kind of alarmist reaction.
All the more so because I have no illusions about their vision.
They showed some light shyness, but that they would respond to hand waving or quick movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
All that remains is to attract a spider.
I am already sending my wishes to the air and I hope that after the execution they did not give up on me.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that Cyclone B.
The Ten Words of Albert Einstein That Enriched the World.
The words of the genius scientist of the last century will probably never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to delve so deeply into everything that the result was always an astounding discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
He became aware of his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic proportions.
Its explanation of the photo effect or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field cannot be omitted either.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity are so complex for many that they prefer to choose easy adverbs for closer acquaintance.
However, it is not easy.
But it wouldn’t be Albert Einstein if he hadn’t found a brilliantly simplified explanation for this: An hour near your loved one seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems an hour, and that’s relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing these ten from his entire collection of famous quotes that literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right.
But only one can prove me wrong at any time.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, then what does the empty table reflect?
I don't know what will be fought in World War III, but in the fourth it will be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous, and knowing much is also dangerous.
If I had an hour to solve a problem that my life depended on, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
Einstein’s formula for success is A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is keeping his mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the region are expecting changes worth $1.5 billion.
"It's a success when we consider that all four of them are in black numbers this year," said the governor Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of the regional facilities is about 32 million crowns at the moment.
This is mainly due to higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kromeriz, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, thanks to this, constructions are on the way, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period of time when we mainly bought equipment was over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, top-class health care cannot be done, said Lubomír Nečas, the regional deputy for health care.
Changes are expected in all hospitals.
Construction workers will be coming to the hospital next year.
In Vsetin, they are now selecting suppliers of the new internal pavilion for almost CZK 300 million.
A dialysis extension is planned in Kromeriz.
Uherské Hradiště wants to build a new interior for about 200 million to this year’s open central pavilion.
And the long-delayed construction of a new central income and an internal one, for which it will take three-quarters of a billion, awaits Bata Hospital in Zlín.
These are all major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," Věra Prousková, director of the hospital, said about the construction of the Vsetín hospital.
The five-story building will be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
More comfort for patients.
The changes, which are particularly noticeable to patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients lie in one room, have only one toilet on the floor, the beds are non-adjustable, the windows are leaking, and health professionals do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our home was built 35 years ago and is now at the end of its life," said Pavel Calabek, director of the Zlín hospital.
In a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with urgent income.
Doctors and patients will have all the acute departments in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model is already half finished in Uherské Hradiště.
Central income is already standing and will be added to it internally within three years.
"We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained director Petr Sládek.
The hospital is the only one that can afford its own funding.
The profit is still the highest and it did not get into the loss two years ago, when the Zlín hospital faced with almost two hundred million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
The hospital’s patients will also get better.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will be spent on repairs, new devices and reconstructions.
Already this year, the detention station will be repaired, then the extension of dialysis or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance will begin.

No one explained to me how I should keep the refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Czech Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD) complains after talks with his European colleagues that other countries are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but rejects any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic, if they do not want to live here anyway.
"We didn't get an answer, so we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you came up with at the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot refer to migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some visions, they are going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not get an answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, the Trust Fund for African countries and other things - we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we say this is the way to go.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We recently raised $40,000, now it's $120,000.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in this territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to come to us, we just don’t know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others, who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, gain asylum with us, have ambitions to come to us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is limited to close to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees do not even want to come to us, but we have already committed ourselves to welcoming fifteen hundred people.
Would it not be possible to accept more of them this way?
We're committed to hiring 1,500 people, but with the condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even with the 1,500, there will be 1,100 people with whom we will deal with the asylum procedure.
They will come to our detention facility and we will treat them the same as the ones we captured.
It is a big question, and we will debate this with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or possibly Hungary.
Because Europe treats this so that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement, which is not yet, it may happen that even the 1100 will not be kept in the territory of the Czech Republic, and they will leave for Germany again when they arrive.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will deal with them in the asylum procedure.
If they are citizens of Syria, Eritrea, they will receive almost 98 percent of international protection, according to European statistics.
They will then be given documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think that these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who are going to be resettled.
This is the second project that is still underway, and we have made progress there only by debating with the churches about the possibility that they could help them get jobs, accommodation, and so on.
But that's a very long run.
You said that at the ministerial meeting other states were not willing to discuss with us.
But is it not the case that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but offers no solidarity to unblock the discussion?
What exactly do you think this is a solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all migrants from Syria can reach them, then the news spreads in hours throughout all camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It calls for another wave of migration to Germany, because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders - simply to deter the waves of migration, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Let them know that they don’t have a chance.
Last year alone, 50,000 Kosovars came to Germany.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutors' offices.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, the 50 percent of what the social systems are now spending on them in vain could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far will it take to tighten up border controls?
We were afraid of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we manage.
We still have a few hundred places available in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we detain will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it as standard.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, with Hungary it is complicated, and the Greeks - this is a completely useless story.
So where's the tipping point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two, three hundred people a day for two, three days in a row will exhaust our capacities to the point that crisis plans will begin.
Then I agree with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in contact by phone several times a day.
If the situation should arise, the government can sit de facto immediately and with one resolution it would decide to strengthen the police by the army, say, the customs administration, or possibly the prison service.
The extreme variant is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think we can get this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we only have the Schengen border at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that Hungarians will try to divert migration flows to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a lot of debt at the last minute.
This prevents them from declaring bankruptcy.
Football fans have paid off their debts.
Even the footballers got their money.
Football club Slavia stood for the first time on Tuesday due to insolvency proceedings in court.
Almost three months after the proposal was filed by the company Online Services from Pacific Samoa.
Within a few hours, attorney Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
Needless to say, she had her arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC, as well as Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně, became the new owner of Slavia.
Apparently, money arrived at the club from the new owners at the last minute.
This is evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vršovický club on Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, sent tens of millions of crowns owed.
"Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15," said attorney Slavia Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or the Czech midfielder Maria Lička.
Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexander Losenicke.
On Friday, the club also paid the due fees of the Prague 10 district.
Thus, only claims that Slavia disputes remain de facto part of the insolvency dispute.
Either according to the club, the commitments have not arisen at all, or there are lawsuits about them.
However, we are prepared to pay in the event of the loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can prove by a statement from the account," Mládková told the judge.
"Everything that has been overdue is paid," Mládková said, adding that only outstanding or disputed liabilities are not paid.
It is also certain that the judge will not make a decision in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the aforementioned debts.
All evidence will then be evaluated.
The decision can be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the hearing to resume on November 3.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
White could have been built so it wouldn't collapse.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
White was safer, the expert said.
The Blanka tunnel complex could have been built in such a way that there would not have been two drops in the ground in Prague’s Stromovka, says Alexandr Butovič, production director of the company Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel.
He said this on Wednesday evening during a journalistic tour of the tunnel.
According to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The driver will open on Saturday afternoon.
There is always a trade-off between price and safety.
“The tunnel could have been made safer, but the costs are growing exponentially,” Butovich said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the ground fell only a few steps from where it began to be made using a safer and more careful method.
"If these measures had been applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka; in 2010, the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav, Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
The building was originally planned to cost 17 billion crowns.
Add to that the VAT, which has jumped twice during the construction period, of the 17 billion you have 21.
When you add technology, land purchase and engineering, valorization and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from the 37, Belohlav said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

FedEx earnings mixed, 2016 fiscal outlook cut
FedEx reported disappointing results in the last quarter and a huge reduction in its annual profit forecast due to low freight demand and higher ground division costs.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
Earlier this year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before opening Wednesday.
FedEx said it expects earnings to be between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The lowered outlook comes despite an average increase in interest rates of 4.9 percent, which will take effect in January. 4, and higher surcharges for land transport of heavy or large parcels, which begin in November.
The company said it still expects earnings growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "showing solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire an extra 90,000 to 95,000 workers, about the same as they did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx raised $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, as predicted by 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a drop in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results of the FedEx ground force.
In the last quarter, ground revenue increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit saw higher income due to higher base rates, while profit fell in the freight trade due to higher labor prices.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent in a year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At its most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week sitting at the 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table, deciding whether it’s time to raise a key interest rate after nearly a decade.
Towering over them at one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a United States mural.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep local prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to start weaning off an unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates in place since late 2008.
Although much of the data shows solid economic growth, recent turbulence in world financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed into adding to volatility by raising its federal funds reference rate - no more than a quarter of a percentage point.
“Clearly, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch first,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait any longer," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is a cause for nervousness in financial markets.
About half of economists recently polled by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to stall the issue, with a key indicator of only about a 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to a fall in the stock market if the Fed raised rates only if policymakers softened the slump by promising no further increases.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers would hold back rates this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed now raises rates," he said.
If Fed policymakers did, “they would have to go to extremes in their program statement and hold hands with the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts have argued that raising rates would calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty from how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects rates to rise this year through spring and early summer despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labor market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years, and is close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of lift.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s 2% annual target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to fluctuate late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors worried that China’s slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market rebounded somewhat this month, and the Dow is now only losing nearly 10% of its May high.
The Fed’s turmoil in the market provides a comprehensive calculation of when to start raising interest rates.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and of reports of weakness in the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, there would be tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on for the latest developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main concerns, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere suggestion by then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "narrow down" their monetary expansion in the market has triggered spasms around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth-management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "The Fed has a history of exaggerations with movements in financial markets that seem disconnected from economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee who pushed for rate increases, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points over three sessions "despite the limited identifiable effects on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should only prioritize concerns about financial stability during a major crisis like the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England.
The latest upheaval is not even close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets have become angry," said Posen, president of the Institute for International Economics Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don’t think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinatown, not a Thaitown.
The market/warehouse is a single point of contact, offering a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There’s even a car part if you need a little bit of engine oil.
The shop is massive and it will take you over an hour to crawl through all the aisles.
If you’re hungry, go for a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various supply points.
What's in stock: Need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it at LAX-C.
The items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
Mez fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and debone it, even fry it for you, if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezer compartment where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork guts, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter semi-finished products and more.
Who shops here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Wide aisles accommodate shopping trolleys and forklifts.
Finding: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is located: The store is in the industrial district of Los Angeles, surrounding the suburbs of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the highways will remain the same.
The acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed limit up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House passed an amendment to the Senate that rejected the increase in speed.
An amendment to the Roads Act will now go to the President.
Czech President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto a law allowing 100 km of speed.
The Czech Transport Minister Dan Lok (for ANO) was also against the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such speed.
On Tuesday, the Senate approved the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow for a speed increase from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane ones, in line with the original government proposal.
The Chamber of Deputies first extended this option to motorways, where it would be possible to drive at speeds of up to 150 km/h in selected sections, but the Senate rejected it.
Members have now accepted his proposal.
With the approval of the Minister of Transport, the senators also removed from the amendment the right of the traffic police to have the final say in the regulation of local roads, which are taken care of by municipalities.
The Senate version, which was approved by the Chamber of Deputies, also counts on the possibility of storing sewers, water mains or public lighting cables longitudinally under the road surface.
This would save the municipalities from buying land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to handle towed vehicles to which owners do not subscribe.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles, which are not claimed by their owners within a six-month period after notification of towing.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight traffic through their territory on the roads of second and third classes under threat of fines also for forwarding companies.
The amendment also removes the possibility of introducing electronic vignettes instead of paper vignettes, which will continue to be used after January 1 next year.
According to the government, this will save money on the introduction of an electronic system.
The Ústí representative is going to trial.
He faces 10 years for overpriced welcome of citizens.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced project Welcome Citizens.
Police wanted to prosecute Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD), but the Chamber of Deputies did not release her.
According to the legal classification of the case, they both face up to 10 years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to the prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused damage of at least CZK 1 million, according to the indictment.
The plaintiff relies on an expert opinion.
According to the plaintiff, the former members of the city management, by virtue of their office, illegally allowed to obtain the property benefit of the company that organized the welcome of the citizens.
According to the indictment, Mandík had asked the then head of the municipal services, education and culture department to address five connected companies in the selection process.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, the town hall cancelled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted by the city administrator and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both charges, led by the aim to secure for Darothore the award of a public contract for the organization of the event of welcoming citizens in Ústí nad Labem, have acted in a long-term and coordinated manner at least in violation of the requirement for the procedure with the care of a proper manager, writes the state attorney.
At the same time, they were aware that Darothore would charge Ústí nad Labem a disproportionately higher price compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
In the end, the city paid only one part, approximately CZK 1.7 million, and then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid, according to the expert opinion, was at least one million crowns overpriced.
Mandik has previously denied any violations of the law.
I haven't committed any crime, I'm innocent.
I do not understand this fabricated case, the former mayor said earlier, saying that the city under his leadership only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was organized by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandík added.
Criminals originally wanted to charge Ms Kailova, who was also a member of the city council, as well.
However, the House of Representatives did not release her for prosecution.
Criminals therefore postponed the case in her case, but they count on the fact that Kailova will be charged after her parliamentary term ends.
Welcoming the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5 thousand crowns to buy children's items and small gifts.
Hungarian police have reportedly released a dog on a refugee.
Then they got the journalist to delete the footage.
Hungarian police have briefly detained an AP cameraman on the border with Serbia, forcing him to delete footage of a police dog allegedly knocking a refugee to the ground.
The Hungarian government has disputed the allegations.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing a cornfield near the Hungarian city of Ruszke crossing the border with Serbia.
Police intervened against the refugees, and one of them let a Syrian attack a dog with a basket on his nose.
The dog of the man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a refugee," he said.
One of the policemen noticed that the Man was filming everything and did not let him go.
The journalist was then no longer allowed to call either his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Police officers took Muzi to a dark place at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
He was then ordered to delete the record.
This is how Muzi lost the result of his two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt he was in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP has sent a letter of protest to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
She called the police's behavior unacceptable and said journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and fearing that the government would destroy the material legally obtained.
Kovács, citing the police report of Muzi, questioned the account of the events.
He said the officers just wanted the journalist to show them if they were in some of the footage, which they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to erase anything.
"Dogs can bark -- they're trained to scare and scare a little, but they didn't attack with certainty," Kovács said.
Unpredictable Champions League.
Win at City kicks us in, believes Juventus
“It’s disappointing, I don’t think we deserved to lose,” said Manuel Pellegrini, the City coach.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Neither team created many opportunities, but we had the ball on the boots for longer.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team conceded 636 minutes in a competitive match.
The finalist of the last season Juventus was exactly the opposite before the clash with each other - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, as a defender of the title, he has only a point and with a score of 2:4 he is in 16th place of the table.
That was why the turnaround at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us psychologically, it will kick us," said coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports - Pirla, Tévez and Vidala.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Mandzukic and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, hopefully thanks to him we will get on the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we are in it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the attacking phase.
My players deserve this result.
"We could have conceded 0-2 before our equalisation goal, but Gianluigi supported us," Allegri coach Buffon said.
"We burned some good chances," said Yaya Toure, City's midfielder.
We have to take experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye Angela, goodbye old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all this media frenzy around is being driven by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's just stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and media are full of children carrying their parents along the dusty paths of the exodus.
And this automatically makes a person - that is, a European person - feel guilty and sympathetic.
Well, they don't just come here desperate babies, notice in the footage of the landing boats to the Greek islands, that the children are not so much to see!
And somehow, recently, pictures of boats heading to Lampedusa, refugees from the French border at Menton, have disappeared from our television, with thousands of young men lying by the beautiful promenade.
For the most part, young black people.
And the pictures from Callais have also disappeared, where these men are eating and waiting to see if they can make it through the tunnel under the English Channel.
I don't think he's moving anymore.
Even the images of the primitive Christian church of Eritrea did not make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
There was too much falsity.
So when it comes to refugee quotas, it is somehow hidden that they are not just unhappy children from Syria, but also secretive - for the elderly: fashionably dressed - young men.
Their musculatures look like they've just come out of some kind of fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
Regardless of the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no ham.
And from them came young black men.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They walked to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes. In their hands, of course, smartphones.
They didn't care about the private beach, and the staff - the Turks, the Muslims! - were obviously afraid of them.
They've taken all the deckchairs.
Anyone who wasn't on it and was in the sea was out of luck.
They were dressed like an American rapper.
On the heads cap with a nail, white and colorful adidas on the legs.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and started feasting.
They cast tables around, stuffed themselves next to the sitting swarthy and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace to somewhere quiet.
Incoming black people drank beer straight out of thirds - as in the series from the USA?! - on the beach throwing empty bottles around.
They were always shouting at each other.
In English it was not.
Then they went to drink wine, straight from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer swimwear, especially the young ladies - in the water screaming and screaming, mothers with children and pensioners ran away horrified, and in half an hour there was not a single black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
No matter if you are a Christian or a Muslim.
Hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice in the evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had, like, a six-inch massive cross of gold around his neck.
Women were like gold.
"Are they drug smugglers?" he asked.
“You saw them drinking,” replied the waiter.
Drugs are not smuggled or used.
They're smuggling something completely different.
I knew what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105 it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what was coming next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known first.
They don't seem to know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were sent to Europe at the time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, the main problem of the European Union has proved to be that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and their associated lobbying and economic groups have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the now publicly recognized main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, also top EU and TV, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic reception of refugees in Germany are at the level of the August 1968 Moscow television images.
Sure, there were a few sun-eaters at the station, but mainly - Old German - Muslims welcomed their compatriots.
For weeks they have been babbling in the news on Czech Television, as according to some research, the Germans are almost all in favour of the arrival of emigrants.
Anyone who has been in Germany for a few days knows that it is a lie like a tower.
This is confirmed by further information.
For example, the famous public opinion research organized by the ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, just a week ago, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees.
That's what our TVs have been melding.
But they hid what broke in Germany the next day: that a poll showed that 94.5 percent of Germans did not want any more immigrants - 67,000 people participated in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago: “Our pursuit of ‘multi-culti’ society has totally failed.”
Then she said, "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts to live together have failed."
In a country of four million Muslims, she said, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating has not worked. They live with us today, and we have been fooling ourselves for some time that they will not stay, that they will one day disappear again.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, where we say that we simply live happily together, has failed.
He completely failed.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
This shows an escalation of events.
Conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euro-German Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, a member of the SPD, the only one who does not even have a high school diploma in the European Parliament - yes, this is the one that Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could play a concentration camp guard from the minute - has done so many times.
It seems, especially under the impression of the latest statements of German politicians that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, with the exception of some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful, solid Germans?
Who for years have tried, at least externally, to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those who say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is sown in the soul of Germany right?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right in halting with all his might the attempts of the Great Germans to dominate the whole centre of Europe?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When it was shut down, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of a Greater Germany, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After the attempt of Marxists to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany on the basis of ecology, which, incidentally, was one of the main ideological doctrines of Nazism.
We would say sunshine.
The German elites had long resisted the rise of German nationalism, leaving all those anti-atom fighters, enthusiasts in search of paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our Forest Must Live.
To satisfy the restless young people everywhere who want to do something different and better, they have fully sided with the anti-warming planet fighters, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they have forgotten that in this current there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic current, which considers all Slavs to be difficult to commit - ever since the days of Karl Marx, who, after his parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements by Schulz and the German ministers openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a leading Germany.
Which must be listened to without question.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And if we add to that that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind this, as always, is capital, especially German capital, which suits it and which derives from the fact that Germany actually controls most of the countries of Europe through banks and the Union.
At first, pseudo-sunshine led Germans into the swamps of environmentalism and multiculturalism, and today it has brought home, and will bring back, perhaps millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the voices of the sirens, will soon stumble upon the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and they will begin to rebel.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors with force, once again a part of its population - but apparently a smaller part - may be ideologically infatuated, but in the end reality, as always, will catch up with it.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when German public protests against incoming Islamists erupt?
Muslims who have long lived in Germany will come to their aid, but certainly not assimilated to take on local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans are fearfully pursuing the Islamization of their country?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when people rise up to protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-superhuman Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict created in Europe by the support of the Sunny ideology, i.e. the ideology of the elitist and essentially totalitarian, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the brazen treatment of the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, it cannot end well.
Finished tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of nosy sellers: scare them to death.
Just knock and a sturdy knocker will knock on you in a way that the weaker nature may not just withstand.
And your head will be turned away from you, and your feet will be turned away from you, and your feet will be turned away from you.
It may be a pity that a talking knocker cannot be bought in reality.
We could use a lot of shit and a lot of shit.
Brussels sprouts (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates dry environments.
And so it is located among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015 I photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to expansive weeds, but visually creates a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
She's erratic. She's doing well in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, is easy to adapt, modest and unpretentious.
It creates leaves with chaotic composition, but it is worth watching and continuing to take photos.
The beauty of detail is still to be found under the microscope - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian pediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet while breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women knowledge of the importance of a good diet when breastfeeding using pictures of babies sucking from their breasts painted with images of junk food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that supply infants with all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic formation of their children and protected them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, though Nine's tries to take the lead on the Today Show
The escape of Karel Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra due to the cost of the consequences of the liberal leadership leak failed to create a sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
The morning show Nine projected from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, Rival Sunrise is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance didn’t seem to matter so much to Aussie TV viewers, as it averaged 397,000 viewers in five capital cities compared to 330,000 viewers on Today.
Today saw a smaller increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today fills the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers, and Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are well, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand has an average of very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could pull off a TV hit without Rebecca Gibney's star Rafters.
Last night's result was a clear "yes."
The X Factor from Seven retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000) smoothly
Seven received mixed ratings on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new TV quiz (from 5:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.), which featured Andrew O'Keefe', had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators, and the second half had an incredible 720,000.
The Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decline of The Chase Australia rating from the second night, Nine will be confident that Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
Secrets revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently figured out who will win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes upon Bachelor is shrouded in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who stay standing won't say who's the one who's going to get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they inadvertently told us who would win.
Sam Wood to keep his mouth shut until Thursday's final
All three women lyrically praised Wood for being the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons for wanting to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a spoiler as to who will win the heart of Bachelor.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as one that would be best suited to Wood besides them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a light relationship since one day.
"From the moment I walked into the house and observed the energy of Sara and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course," Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is a really earthy woman, she’s a lot of fun,” Markoski said.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They feel good and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood could be a good couple.
Behind her, she claims that during his last visits home, she realized that Wood might be "the one."
“Once I saw him with my friends and family, I realized this wasn’t just a game anymore, I opened my whole heart to him.”
I asked who Wood would choose if not her, she looked mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I like both girls equally - it's a tie between Snezena and Lana.
The Bachelor is broadcast Wednesday at 7.30 on Ten.
Originally published as Sarah's best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options where to launch his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States and a lot of teams asked about his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seems like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit out for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, made by the Australian Rugby League convert in the first kickoff from the pitch in Tuesday's 20:3 win to Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him in the game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also endorsed Hayne publicly at the post-match press conference.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, stated that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and just worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne made his mistake in the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings.
It certainly wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for with his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught swearing when he left the field after a mistake and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his NFL career he could not have imagined.
“It happens, you just focus on the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the awkwardness to his original debut in 2007, when a recording in his own goal territory led to a three-way Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo with fans holding the Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested while pointing pistols at a Siberian runway.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company confiscated, and his democratic efforts curtailed.
The ÚS stood up for emigrants who demanded compensation for their property.
The pair emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state with a request for compensation under the Act on Extrajudicial Rehabilitation.
The court first awarded them the required amount, i.e. more than CZK 2.8 million, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim by awarding them just under CZK 90,000, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to price regulations from 1991.
The émigrés were defended by the Supreme Court and the amount originally charged to them.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to the ÚS with a complaint.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at that time - even if it was then an adequate compensation in relation to the property taken away - now amounts to only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot be a burden for the secondary participants as in the restitution of entitled persons who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who did not have the opportunity to obtain compensation earlier," Judge Jaroslav Fenyk explained why the ÚS sided with the emigrants.
"The ÚS has repeatedly expressed its support for the general courts to proceed in restitution cases in such a way that possible inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation is always achieved, i.e. the redress of property wrongs caused by acts of the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio TWO will now be played by Radka Fišarová.
Radka Fišarová, by the way, became the world’s youngest Evita, playing the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Spiral Theatre in Prague in 1998.
Returning to the same role, he says, "To this day, Evita's difficulty hasn't matched much of a performance."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended by Monika Absolon for the role of First Lady of Argentina.
I’ve seen the monkey in Evita three times and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Suddenly I saw a completely new concept.
I'm a big fan of more modern modifications, but this one is just particularly good.
"Ondřej Sokol's direction is original, light and contemporary," Fišarová said.
The musical scepter between the two singers will be handed over at Monika Absolon’s birthday concert on September 27 at 7 pm at Studio DVA.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.

4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of protesters against a draft of a new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the leading district officer, reports that more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal states that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new province under the proposed new constitution, and moderated their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the Tharus ethnic group demanding the creation of their own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have sped up the process after a devastating earthquake killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers in Kathmandu this week voted to establish a draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We absolutely mustn't panic now.
After losing on the ice championship Litvínov you could not even manage home duel with Sparta hockey players (3:5).
Aren’t you just as worried about getting into the extra league as you were a year ago?
I hope nothing like this ever happens again.

NHC predicts 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde islands
A wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of Cape Verde's southernmost islands has a 60 percent chance of creating a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone formation over the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has said it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for aid organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European states fleeing war-torn and poor countries.
Google announced this on its blog in an unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoud posted the report on her blog based on her personal experience as a seven-year-old refugee from Kabul with her family.
“We have travelled on many dark trains and buses, and we have experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families are willing to help.
All donations will be distributed among four non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said that all posts made through google.com/refugeerelief will double to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II, most coming from Syria, a four-year war that has displaced 4 million people this year alone.
Many are fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery could be useful for moderately obese diabetics
The benefits of weight loss surgery for moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to tell whether moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality figures take a long time to show," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial for a new study on JAMA surgery.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery use different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reduce hunger and restrict the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the height-related weight relationship, is considered normal at values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates a person is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study that looked at two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass surgery and gastrectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatments for people who were moderately obese.
The average BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given diabetes surgery remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the group treated, only 1 percent of the patients had diabetes, and only 2 percent had it.
Furthermore, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol was shown to be “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s levels of hemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflects continuous blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, the researchers say.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the treated group, however, this figure remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" -- which is reflected in better hemoglobin A1c levels -- didn't reduce mortality at age five, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent), and were more likely to have diabetes remission (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to life extension, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent greater chance of survival over the next 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone, it is a calming result for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This is where the work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he states.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after a patient’s BMI drops between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ve been waiting too long to let people know the seriousness of the situation,” he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that firmly link their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the refugee home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in solving the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
“Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring about real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries,” he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the U.S. violent response triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush, advising him that the way to resolve the problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested a sanitizing agent in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitizer, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, the number of ingestions of sanitation by children under 12 years of age reported to poison control centers has increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink the sanitizer intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teens drinking sanitation because of cheap fuss.
Teenagers are reported to have mixed the sanitizer with a mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the remedy.
"The children don't think it could hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot of the more attractive (sanitation products) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitizers with the smell of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very attractive for children.
The sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few elbows can indicate alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital's poison control center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn’t leave a glass of whiskey lying around, either, but people will leave these sanitizers outside, and when the kids get to them, it’s a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ate up to four loci of strawberry-scented sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered drunkenness in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who cared for her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered indistinct words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange for sanitation products to be out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation products have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials believed the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teachers by placing antibacterial products around the room," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation products and has banned their presence in the room.
Police assessed the foiled plan as "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
No dissonance in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays talk of a mismatch at Celtic, while Deila admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The ADAMA Rooney first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a tight win over Hamilton at Pittodria, giving the Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of inconsistency
This situation has sparked rumors of a mismatch at Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased oversight in preparation for the match with the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don’t think we’re under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Shortage in Scottish title rivalry bores Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands national Ronald de Boer says Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no rivalry between them over the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax’s ambassador, said: “In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic’s games, and why?”
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People here aren't just talking about Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the Old Firm matches and it is not only the people of Scotland who are watching these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila commits.
ROONY Dealia has admitted that Celtic is a little stumbling, but the Norwegian boss has pledged to turn things back for good.
The defeat by Malmo and the subsequent loss from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now rises to the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already had bad times and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current events.
We are the same way, but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic’s support because it makes the players so much better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton is worried about January's reinforcements
Despite comments that surfaced weeks ago suggesting he had already identified some of his January goals, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about a large buy of reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the team from Ibrox.
The former Brentford boss states, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer one."
The players who come in the summer have the whole pre-season to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer goal indicates retirement
Swansea striker Michu, who was linked to Celtic in the transfer window, hinted that he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
The 20-year-old has been having problems with a prone ankle for two years and failed to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to fight SFA over comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and they eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by referee Collum to be rescinded.
Neilson stands by his claim, stating, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths pledges to avoid Tynecastle
Stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a tense moment," the striker said, continuing, "I can safely say I won't be coming back to Tynecastle if it's not in the Celtic jersey."
Tannadice Council believes in driving Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still believes in correcting the situation with the current management of the team - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys back in action," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes pleased with 'ugly win' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately hold on against Hamilton Accies in order to get their seventh consecutive league win and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a first-half penalty handed by Adam Rooney.
McInnes states, "There is no team that has won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning this type of matches."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged as UK unemployment rises
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK (5.5 percent), as data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now halted at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scotland Secretary of State David Mundell said in a comment on the latest figures: "The long-term government plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment has risen while unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witnessed the Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will watch the killing of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the death chamber of Oklahoma State Penitentiary, and I'll see Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials to witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day gets closer, I get scared.
Why am I doing this, then?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is being conducted to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will be watching the entire execution dispassionately.
I can't do that.
I'll be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've forged a special bond with him through months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notepad and be able to record what I see.
I’ll just have to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the anti-death penalty procedures.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I’ve created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that not enough evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And it is from this perspective that I will watch his death.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
For this purpose, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love die a pointless death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after freeing the men from Canning River.
The bet by a man from Petrh that he would escape the police did not come out after he got into shallow muddy water just meters away from a police officer who tried to persuade him non-violently to go back to shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called in an incident extending into Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, just come get me,'" Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use safer tactics and that was police negotiations."
“Sometimes people try to do funny things when they escape,” Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins sets a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid the bus and attempt to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody says organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the organisers and integrity department of Racing Victoria and based himself on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with a late scratching of Lady Tatai in maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin's positive smear on cobalt, which he can't explain.
He bit his tongue about espionage charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my head up and make the owners think that I am doing my best for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
After that, I'd have to consider what I'd do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had launched a bombshell in an interview with racing.com that the integrity of the department had attempted to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job at my stables for finding out about things being done in my stables," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in an attempt to catch me, they've completely blown up.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saudry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a few balls and make people outside the coaching positions take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them some thought.
But I got to a point where I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really made me sad.
I will put pressure on them and put a burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's frustration levels increased with long-term investigations into cobalt including Lidari, and a recent scratch made him feel like he "could have hours of his license on the table."
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated Black Caviar champion, called the day-of-race treatment rule "ridiculous" after horses were applied clay or mud to their feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treating the tiles on the day of the race, to which the organizers had already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand we need rules, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
The Cobra driver who fled was arrested.
Police have arrested a man who struck a cyclist over the weekend in Cobra and left after the collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed himself to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with failure to stop in an accident, failure to provide assistance, and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, head coach of the Melbourne Storm, criticized his players' interventions as "setting a plan" by two NRL premiership favorites.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees had allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during the Storm team's controversial win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark on Strorm after his team won the qualifying final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "show" of rugby league and according to him two of Queensland were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended the interventions of his players, saying they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that the situation boosted his confidence as his team is criticized by two leading coaches, which may mean they are afraid of being beaten by Team Storm.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything from our defensive system and techniques in the last year, we have only put emphasis on contact during the procedures in the last weeks, and this has meant a turnaround for us.
Trent's been here for three years and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which might have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like this always come up this time of year.
Bellamy denigrated Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right in that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours, and it was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that he finds disruptive, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
This is the kind of football you would like to play if you had this type of player at your disposal.
He said this in 2010 and now he wants all the teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more confident because they say things like that, because they're afraid to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that more goals were scored in the Storm and Roosters game than in the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos team's game was probably good, I didn't look, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are the breaks and not scoring attempts interesting?
I think they are agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at some stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for possessing 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled out of Queensland has been granted a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of the drug from the Solay yacht, which arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting the accused together at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug at a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of cocaine of commercial quality, Maksimovic's lawyer put up a defense that there was no evidence that he owned the entire amount and that he might have been in the cafe entirely accidentally and innocently.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed Maksimovic would flee.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said on Wednesday.
In the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
His mother and stepfather, Maksimovic, have jointly offered to bail him out of prison for $200,000.
"After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the $200,000 deposit is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts alone were clearly insufficient, as the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic has been granted bail on condition that he gives up both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily, and abides by the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged on to her online chat, where he had a lot of naughty photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found that her phone was missing and then found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She went through it, and before alerting her mother, she found disturbing news.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then analytical computers found the address and discovered "worrisome" searches on the web using terms to search for naughty pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to police that his reason was to "lead pedophiles" on the Internet before he would "pretend to be a police officer and scare them off."
Fiscal representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admits that he did the computer searches, but claims that he only wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them.
He claims to have lost his mind while drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rapes and murders.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on her phone, he called his mother, shaking and crying.
She saw naughty pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to filing a lawsuit for accepting or providing inappropriate pictures of children on June 14, last year, violating bail terms on January 25 and failing to appear in court on March 24, this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim has asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offender list because he can argue that there was "no underlying sexual overtones" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October for filing reports of social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody prior to hearing on the other pending cases.
He was placed on the sex offender list before the date of his sentencing.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers speech to parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell on the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tainted by claims by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous death threats warning them of Mr Mugabe's squealing during his speech.
He was booed and provoked last month during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) MP's chairman, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning not to obstruct Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that doesn't show up, but it's called 'death,'" Mugabe told reporters.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament, and as soon as they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, had "concerned" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard has cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save business services costs.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the PC and printer business from its faster-growing business hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive, sustainable spending structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores to help businesses transition to the new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will be “focused on delivering unmatched integrated technology solutions” to companies.
This will break down a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who manufacture electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage has been nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP was undergoing a massive reorganization to handle the move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical firms in America, is the latest in a sector based on the belief that a narrowly specialized company is performing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilshere that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason not to play at Christmas again.
This best-case scenario already means Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from a historical perspective, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship is clearly uncertain.
A big shame about this latest issue is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back into former form during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger said.
It is a wound that requires healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It was not about his ankles or the injuries he had suffered before.
This could be medically true, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he made his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has played only 65 league matches in the Arsenal of 157 total:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that improvements in the area of recorded injuries over the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition,” Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get through this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it does, and he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal begins campaigning in the Champions League on Wednesday nights against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger prepares to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to join.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
“I try to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo also were not defeated in a total of 41 matches after maintaining a "unbeatable" campaign last season.
The stadium shook on Wednesday night with a 3.2-degree Richter earthquake.
This was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks Arsenal have learned their lesson from last season’s Champions League capitulation against Monaco, and he has little hope of leading the club to its first European Cup victory.
“This is a huge effort,” Wenger said.
It never happened to the Arsenal.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of such depictions in various shows is glaring, especially given how the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever when it comes to suicide among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death among men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common among men than women.
In an effort to address this issue, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, aiming to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies a friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of friends with “healthy moods,” their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends is half the chance of experiencing mental health problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must first be attainable.
In this social media communication with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun-loving, and more successful has doubled, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - that have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire game creator recently explained, money really doesn’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent sacrifice, moments of watching football in comfortable armchairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stem from the realization that yes, men can also identify with it, although they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me, “my role as a listener of people who are depressed or suicidal has really confirmed to me that even the smallest of friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
It emphasizes small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, the status of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a greater close, from a network of friends and family.
So, if you’re heading to the Comedy Central’s FrendsFest this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the party interior will be completely redesigned.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish - 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his debut in the Champions League, helping PSG to beat Sweden's Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's the report on the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmo at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and this PSG player sent the French champions after the win, but then threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a goal with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their way to the quarterfinals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it wasn’t Laurent Blanc’s classic performance, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was prodigal before the goal and was later replaced against his home team and the club in which he began his illustrious career in 1999.
“In the Champions League, it’s not easy to win outside or at home, so a 2-0 win is a problem for our opponents and looking comfortable on defense is a good start, although there are things we’ll have to improve on as the season progresses,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we didn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned as one of three PSG changes to his home draw of 2-2 this weekend with Bordeaux in League 1, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was identified as the man who took PSG to a new level in Europe after a transfer from Manchester United last month, and showed why when he ran on Marco Verratti’s pass for Malmo and sent the ball behind Johan Wiland’s back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to kick-start a spectacular PSG win, they must have been disappointed.
Malmo, which defeated Celtic in the playoffs and made it to this stage, started with 9 internationals in the basic line-up and five defenders and two drawn midfielders were a tough opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjic's shot, which just missed Kevin Trapp's far corner goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves reaped the benefits of the attack with poor passes and a crappy finish that was no good even from Ibrahimovic, who could not fire even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed as his shot arrived in the net shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved much more appropriate when it came to preparing chances for his teammates and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a turn shot that ended in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan header sent the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic passed him after a pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
This put an end to all of Malmo’s thoughts about the possibility that they could benefit from the match, and only the excellent intervention of Wiland from a great distance frustrated the hopes of David Luiz and the score remained unchanged even when Ezequiel Lavezzi’s goal was unrecognized at the end of the match.
Malmo coach Hareide said: "Our last game in the Champions League was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a wonderful match for them.
Glencore makes $2.5 billion in stock sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which was hit by a commodity price collapse, made $2.5 billion from stock sales on Wednesday as part of its extensive debt-reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold about $1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with rehashing commodity prices as China’s economic slowdown depresses demand and sparks destruction across markets.
Rights issues sent Glencore stock prices to the top of the London stock market in early morning trades on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that a $2.5 billion share sale is part of a broader plan to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares at 123 pence per share, marking a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about delaying China’s growth have cut the price of iron ore by almost half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House Confirms Washington Visit to Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in a statement.
President Xi’s first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner after the talks are over.
“President Xi’s visit represents an opportunity to strengthen U.S.-China relations and encourages cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the differences between the two states,” the report added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet with several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York for a U.N. meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address controversial issues, including Washington’s concern about China’s alleged cyberespionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.
The emergency flare launched by Germany has far from cementing the European crew, but is already forcing the ship to change course, the French newspaper Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the refugee problem first: it would be more likely to systematically sort migrants and asylum-seekers as they set foot on the old continent - especially in Greece - than to argue over the future distribution of refugees by quota based on the amount that is increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the member states changed priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of the refugees, it is first necessary to filter out those who are arriving today and resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," the ministers said in a text discussed in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its decisiveness and increases the pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in that country.
The Central Power is thus making it clear that without it, no free movement in Europe is possible.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary did this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under Schengen rules.
It’s a domino effect, but it can also be seen by the blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maiziere intensively discussed this during a private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is being implemented.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of new arrivals have already been registered and identified with fingerprinting.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it is more afraid than others that camps will remain on its shoulders in which refugees would accumulate at its expense.
The real black hole is Greece.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after going through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, has put their hands in their laps.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and a source of shared concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises to implement the checkpoints as soon as possible, but has not given any number or date.
“The challenges facing Greece extend to the whole of Europe,” EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on the front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying the intervention teams of the European border control agency Frontex in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its reception capacity and strengthen its surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From a legal point of view, Athens will continue to have the final say.
The question of the creation of genuine European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is close to it.
The new emergency situation of the 28-nation bloc has already pushed back the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was raised earlier this year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament, and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in a text approved by a majority of 28.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm pledge includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, an agreement already reached in June during a hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven people were killed in an avalanche in the Alps, including three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
German authorities say she is the only survivor of the eight-member group.
Previous reports said it was Polish.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a severe leg injury in the femur area.
The dead, according to AFP, were mostly in their forties.
"The rescue operation is over, and the bodies of the victims have also been taken to Briancon for identification," Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department, said in a statement.
The disaster occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the peak of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4,015 metres.
"The avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said Nicolas Colombani, head of emergency services.
According to him, an enormous amount of snow was pouring on the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The weather service did not warn of bad weather in the area today.
"Trpišovský before the match with Braga: Finally a true Europe".
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, during his premiere in the cups, managed to pass through the Europa League preliminary rounds with Liberec footballers to the basic group and now he is looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
Slovan will welcome the finalist from 2011 Braga at the beginning of the main phase of the competition and, according to the coach, wants to impose his playing style on him.
After all the nerves in the knockout fights, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on your way to the dream group, now we are there and we will play six matches.
Of course, we want to win, but we do not have to worry about every goal, we can play our tactics and we are not bound by a double match.
"I am very much looking forward to it and it is a true Europe, before that it was just a qualification," Trpišovský said at a press conference.
He sees Braga as a top team.
He will be very active, they have all Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent might be more difficult because he doesn’t have such a name, but he has a player in his squad who I think scored three goals for Manchester.
"It's an excellent team at the top level," said Trpišovský.
He does not consider Braga to be a clear favourite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not underdogs.
"I think we showed that we are strong in our stadium and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen from eleven games this season.
He believes that Liberec can also impose its style on Braze.
We are waiting for a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 setup with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"It's a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the pitch," said Trpišovský.
We studied our opponents a lot in the preliminary rounds, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted to the trainings.
"And we definitely want, although it will be very difficult, to play according to our notes," added the coach.
Student films dominate Písek, the international festival begins.
This year, more than 350 authors from 51 countries entered their works into the competition of the 15th International Student Film Festival in Písek.
Forty of them, sent to the final by a committee of students and teachers, will be screened in the Portyč cinema from 15 to 18 October.
The best of them will be selected by an international jury, festival spokesperson Jakub Charvát said.
Every year, the festival has a special theme, which is based on the festival theme.
It's a detective story this year.
The director of this year’s gala evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And of course we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year," Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student films - feature films, animated films and documentaries.
They will be judged by an international jury, including last year’s winner Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the festival organizers prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbo šanson band Poletěme?, playful band Zrní or Petra Hapková with a recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first will be brought by a graduate of the Písek Film School and a holder of prestigious awards, including the one from World Press Photo 2014, Jana Asenbrennerová.
The second exhibition will show the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
Cinematographer and documentary filmmaker Martin Čech will come to the discussion with visitors, the silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by music by Gerhard Gruber and the sand natives Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotný.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy that will live on.
“Young people from all over the world will continue to come together, exchange experiences and develop common ties and filmmaking skills,” the spokesperson said.
Pitching forum, where students can meet with film professionals, take several job auditions at once and get a job, will certainly help.
The festival is associated with the establishment of the Private Higher Professional Film School in Písek.
Its founders, husband and wife Vladan and Miloň Terča, organized the first year in 1997.
By the sixth grade, it was held once every two years.
In the event of bankruptcy, insurance companies are to pay the claims of clients in full.
Insurance companies should cover the claims of clients in the event of the travel agency’s bankruptcy in full.
This was decided by the House on Wednesday, when it approved an amended amendment to the law on the conditions of doing business in tourism.
According to the draft, travel agencies will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee.
Insurance companies do not agree with the obligation to pay the claims of clients even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the adjustment, argues consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to stop insuring travel agencies against bankruptcy if the amendment goes into effect.
The proposal has also been criticised by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go abroad.
Regional Development Minister Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that the cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Eurocomform.
She drew attention to this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund, regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the correct limit, Šlechtová stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit that it is feasible," TOP 09 vice-chairman Miroslav Kalousek said.
The bank guarantee will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
"Travel agencies will have to stop their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
A member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agents Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalousek’s concerns based on a survey among members of the travel agency.
"Stop showing us lobbying by insurance companies," he said.
Okamura does not consider the insurance companies’ statements to be relevant and there is no official written statement to that effect.
However, they are trying to figure out whether travel agencies will be complicit, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the rival Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about deleting the stairs for Czech travel agencies, also warned about the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer said.
Her motion to delete the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Neither did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) come forward with a proposal to return the draft to the committee due to an alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Philip warned of travel agencies that could pose a threat to consumers.
The rapporteur, Martina Berdychová (ANO), withdrew her proposal to limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not have known that the insurance coverage would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not propose a minimum insurance limit of four million for travel agencies offering air travel and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The border will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales of tours.
However, the insurance coverage limit will have to be such that in the event of the travel agency’s bankruptcy, it will cover all customer claims.
Even after the modifications, the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to newly indicate which travel agency organizes the tour for the sold tours.
Travel agencies will have to submit to the insurance companies, among other things, data on the economy and number of tours before concluding the contract.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also provides for further regular information to insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide monthly data on the number of passengers and sold tours, the total price of sold tours and the amount of advance payments and sales for tours and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has not fulfilled any of the statutory obligations towards the insurance company, it will ask the travel agency to remedy it according to the draft or will be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts in the event that the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of customers.
The amendment also provides for new financing for the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will be submitted until the end of April for another year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial plan of expenditure and a outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the law submitter did not think about what would happen if the insurance company terminated the contract.
It will not be allowed to organize tours, and clients who purchased the tour before the cancellation of the insurance, according to the association, will lose it.
In this case, CK will suffer a significant loss and may even go bankrupt, even though its management was in good shape.
One way travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be to sue the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and take advantage of much softer conditions abroad and then we will only operate in our market as agencies, said the vice-chairman of the association, John Pope.
According to him, the draft amendment also contains the institution of a bank guarantee, but so unthought-out that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantee cannot sound for an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the association, the change of the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, the whole law will have to be recast due to the new EU directive.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies are currently operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs have ceased their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth about 20 billion CZK a year.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with German prime ministers.
At the same time, it called again for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28 member states.
We need to do more to help the countries where refugees leave or stay after they leave their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will promote decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, the German Chancellor said, according to which such a signal could also be increased financial assistance or closer cooperation of the EU with international humanitarian organisations.
“The federal states also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis among European countries,” Merkel said.
Prime Minister of Brandenburg Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU states.
The Czech Republic has long rejected the distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke out in favour of speeding up the asylum process in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start integrating foreigners more quickly, the Brandenburg prime minister said.
He said most of the money Germany spends on caring for refugees should be used to integrate those who have a chance to get asylum.
More teachers will be needed for refugees to master German.
It’s a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if we can integrate the refugees, they can become a benefit for us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in the film
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a debate on diversity, claiming it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During a Sunday episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the actor cast in the series interrupted Brown as she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives about the black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie, not a show,” Damon said.
Shocked, Brown reacted scandalously with disbelief and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments about the Martian made the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with joint known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown said in the beginning.
The only black character who's a hooker who's being picked up by a white pimp.
Producer of Dear White People championed finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted that their directing "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in dissonance with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at the clip's writing, "Matt Damon has jumped into the language of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is so white that it hurts so much."
The tweet has received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After a teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took national effect and pressured law makers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against non-white people.
In February, singer Prince made allusions to the movement, while he featured the nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Most recently, the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to the Fox News personality question, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the group said in a statement.
Damon was recently reported on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss portrayals of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met with the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has first winner"
Professional mountaineer Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win an American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday, taking home $1 million.
In the competition, which just ended its seventh season, none of the contestants managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During this season's finale, two men made it to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb on a more than 220 m long rope.
Britten was the first to climb within the set limit, becoming the first contestant to overcome a debilitating four-stroke in American Ninja Warrior, however, Caldiero overcame it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview to NewsE! News right after his hard-earned win and was still in shock of winning the $1 million grand prize.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," said Isaac E! in response to his win.
“All of a sudden, I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like now.”
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the final and why Britten won't get any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to finish the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the person who finishes the course the fastest.
“If there are more competitors on the track, the winner will be the one with the best time,” Weed said.
Even if winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he's holding a grudge.
He is glad that he has achieved what he has achieved.
He received a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy and he loves his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife."
Geoff told me, “If there was anyone who could beat me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think if I had won, Isaac would have felt the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with its eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just passed the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the park.
The Tigers, one of the top baseball teams, are in last place in the Central Division of the American League right now.
The Tigers narrowly averted their defeat, defeating Minnesota in Tuesday's game with a tight 5-4 result at Target Field Stadium.
The Twins missed a chance to get close to the Houston Astros and grab a second wild card in the American League.
Even if only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which was so elusive to them during the second half of the season.
“Winning is always fun, and it doesn’t matter which way,” said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive entry and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings and then took on another in the sixth and ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 hits and 3 runs.
It was only his third game of the last nine games.
“I want to finish this year with convincing results,” Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a game when you’re sitting on the bench a lot and that’s why I want to get into the game.”
Tigers batsman Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 runs and his first withdrawal point since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-point game since the last June game, in which he hit four times in a match against the Seattle Mariners.
"He's leaning into it," Ausmus said.
"He looked good in training, he batted noticeably better and he managed to transfer it to the game."
With three runs at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins got the best chance of getting back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton earned an innings thanks to two points on the left side of the pitch.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks scored a point thanks to a bat set, and Simon struck out Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent Mauer and had a batsman, Miguel San, in front of him, who batted the ball and circled two bases, leaving behind right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two players on the bases and a chance for a draw in the second innings, VerHagen managed to send the third baseman over two bases.
Plouffe has already earned 27 runs over two bases this season and is reigning the league table.
Detroit kept the ninth inning, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon secured a score of 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander knocked San out on three pitches.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in Phil Hughes' game.
The Tigers won three runs in the first two innings against a retired right-handed man who came into the game after more than a month's break due to inflammation of the back muscles.
“I certainly didn’t imagine such a start,” Hughes said, “but I felt I was pitching better during the third inning.”
After resisting the onslaught in the first innings, Hughes dropped one point to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Two exits for right fielder J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez, who first circled all bases.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the pitch and scored another run, but Victor Martinez was bowled out when he tried to make a run for third base.
The Tigers added in the second innings when pitcher James McCann and fielder Anthony Gose earned them two and then one point respectively, with a score of 3-0 on the resulting board.
"That got us to our knees," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
“He didn’t hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place.”
Hughes, who won on number of pitches, finished in the third innings with no points and was replaced by right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three bases, getting six hits and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers' right pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be cared for by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to strained shoulder muscles, is expected to start Wednesday's game.
Sanchez is replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who returns after an injury and takes on the Twins.
As of June 30, when Norris was traded to left pitcher David Price, he has a score of 1-1 after 4 matches.
However, he has not played since August 20 due to a strained muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third game together at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota left-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is Tuesday's management reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said regarding the 16th meeting of the central group on deepening overall reform.
Promoting opening-up in emerging reforms will give new impetus and vitality, it will also provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, a relaxation of the border control policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital, and a reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and businesses that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programs.
The move is significant because it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, provide a legal business environment and make the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and make sure that the companies themselves decide how to run their business.
The statement also said China would allow border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up state-controlled industries, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide better services to them," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," thanks to optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process.
Ensuring lawyers' rights to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
New bed wards may be created in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub Pánik (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD), the current capacity of the wards of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the wards of individual hospitals.
There are also opportunities to expand care.
For example, in the department of surgical departments, one-day surgery centers could be established, where surgical procedures would be performed according to the set concept, which do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours.
It is not yet clear in which specific hospitals a one-day surgery facility should be.
At the skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser centre could be created with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the establishment of an apalic center to care for patients with brain disabilities who are in a vegetative state.
Such a center should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiology-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a device in the hospital Ostrov, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which seems to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region, are the beds of follow-up care, especially the beds of the Long-Term Care Center (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should be closely linked to the acute care beds.
Part of this device should function as rehabilitation beds and part as classic LDN beds, the concept recommends.
As he points out, aftercare beds are missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
There, abandoned buildings could be used after centralization.
Last but not least, the Karlovy Vary region lacks social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
There is a shortage of these beds throughout the country, so it could also serve as a so-called Alzheimer center for other regions.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, for which European subsidies will be released.
"These are beds that will be linked to the areas of supesspecialized care and will form a space for the translation of patients after the procedure, for example, after cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other surgery," describes the regional concept of in-patient care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
