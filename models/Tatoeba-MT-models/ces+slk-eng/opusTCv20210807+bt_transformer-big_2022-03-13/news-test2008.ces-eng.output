Inflation Rises in Europe Due to Food
The accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
November’s price growth in 13 eurozone countries was higher than expected, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent registered after 2.6 percent in October, Luxembourg’s Union Statistics Office reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian issuance banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the base interest rate, saying that the reduction, along with rising raw material prices and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it has to “deter” inflation so that it doesn’t have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation is a record 3.3 percent for a 15-year period, rising from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent in Spain.
Inflation in the euro area has skyrocketed due to soaring food and energy prices.
Wheat futures prices have risen by 88 percent, and the soybean exchange rate has also reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets has risen by 52 percent this year and last month already cost one barrel of black gold almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 percent in 2008 to 2.5 percent this year, but it will already fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation level will remain at around 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The Fidesz support group has grown significantly since the beginning of December, and now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of socialists, the Gallup Institute has never seen such a low - 13% support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) support compared to one-fifth support for MSZP.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament: their support within the entire population is 2%.
Among certain party voters, supporters of both camps are one percent more.
Public opinion on the economy has deteriorated in comparison with the previous low - never before has the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be downright very bad been so high - 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent the situation is quite bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about the change in their material situation after spring and summer prospects.
As for next year, a larger part of the population expects a further deterioration and only a tenth with an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, the most in Gallup polls to date, said the prime minister was doing his job poorly rather than well.
Ferenc Gyurcsány is trusted or highly trusted by 13 percent of those polled, while Viktor Orbán’s support rate is 38 percent.
The prime minister is not trusted by 54 percent and the leader of the Fidesz movement by 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be solved without changing the government.
While after last October's riots, 35 percent considered it desirable to remain in government and the prime minister, at present this share is only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in the announcement of new elections.
It is significant for the interest in the referendum that 60 percent of those polled answered a question about their possible participation that they would definitely come to the referendum and another 20 percent said that they would probably come.
By comparison, only 55 per cent would have participated in the 'parliamentary elections held this Sunday', and another 15 per cent consider their turnout likely. The success of the referendum would be unquestionable on the basis of the current intentions.
The school would say no to 74, doctor’s fees to 79, and hospital fees to 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportion only in the circle of people who certainly promise to participate, then the introduction of tuition fees, doctor fees and hospital fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth more expensive than Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budapest business triangle maintained last year’s 16% increase in the price level on average, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
Napi Gazdaság’s usual Christmas basket in the Budapest business triangle grew by an average of 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets, the price increased well over a thousand forints.
Since prices in food supermarkets “flyed out” already last December, the percentage did not show a drastic increase due to the previously high base.
But it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that what they could have bought last year for less than nine thousand forints, they will not buy now for ten thousand.
The consumption basket of the Daily Economy in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest basket price was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, but the price of raw breast, nuts and poppy seeds was very high.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to those of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread even for 139 forints.
The competition did not go below 200 forints.
It was equally surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coke in a return bottle was below 200 forints, so even with a deposit, the product cost only 257 forints.
Yet this year, according to the consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság Auchan, it appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices in the consumer basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság increased by 15 percent compared to last year’s prices at Christmas, while both Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent.
Compared to last year’s highest and this year’s lowest consumer basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest was 21 percent.
In forints, the increase averaged 1,480.
The average price increase last year was 1,206 forints, with prices being affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It was this process that disrupted trade, and the department stores clearly could not decide how large the price ranges for individual products should be, because they could not predict what the effect of the price change on consumption would be.
(If a trader misplans the speed of circulation of a given product, he may lose a significant profit due to the price range adjusted to the intensity of the circulation.)
Due to VAT, last year's rise in the price of the consumer basket of the Napi Gazdaság newspaper was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while for the cheapest, the price difference was 844 forints.
This year, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 more forints than last year, and the cheapest one also cost 1,284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, prices rose disastrously, and in less than 20 months, hypermarket goods increased their daily consumption by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, is not absolutely confirmed by the data of the Central Statistical Office: it has measured price increases in excess of 30 percent over 12 months for several staple foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the consumer basket of the Daily Economy, this seems almost impossible, because the price level of the product, which was already quite expensive last year, showed price growth of barely above 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they have managed to push through drastic price increases in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the business golden triangle do not complain, they still report on a good year.
In our experience, most customers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Everything is bought in quantities, durable food is taken after wages.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets were forming long queues at the checkout desks, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, in the countryside the turnover is lower, several international chains complain to research firms that sales lag behind their plans, not only for food, but also for durable consumer goods.
In many places, they are saved on disinfectants
This year, more than 1,000 cases of infection have been registered in hospitals, mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding of beds, and overloading staff are not helping to stop the outbreaks, according to the head of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, they are also saved on disinfectants.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been discovered in a man who got to the hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site earlier this year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after he had to return with an MRSA infection, and due to the bacterium found in his body, one important operation could not be performed.
By December 10, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multidrug-resistant disease agents had been reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, Karolina Boercz, head of the National Epidemiology Center, said.
This means that so many infections caused by multidrug-resistant agents have been registered in hospitals with certainty, the others are unknown.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant golden staphylococcus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria is worn by a third of people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cervical inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, morning infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are given excessively or inappropriately, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop into bacteria that are very resistant to antibiotics and that spread rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
Especially in case of temporary or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with a weakened organism, low body weight or in patients over the years, it can cause serious hospital infections, for example, morning infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the chief physician of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections are part of daily practice in hospitals.
"The infection is not to be confused with an epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the causative agent of the disease is not investigated."
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the nursing staff treat them with rubber gloves and masks and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first checked to see if MRSA is present, but infection is not always preventable.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could have been prevented, but the current conditions in domestic hospitals are not favorable for the prevention and spread of multidrug-resistant disease agents, Karolina Boerczová said.
Because the infection is typically found in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals that receive patients should check and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, microbiology sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It is also important to note that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases are thus revealed if the patient suffers from a perceptible MRSA infection, the chief of the epidemiology center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment with antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, medical records.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, or microbiological tests should be performed, to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not follow this in all cases.
Collections of microbiological samples are even rarer for basic or outpatient treatment of patients, Karolina said.
Saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most commonly spread among patients through medical personnel.
Therefore, hand washing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but even in hospitals there are serious shortcomings.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and touch, but in the conditions of home hospitals it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately, we can also see that hospitals, which are in an unfavourable material situation, are saving on disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, which increases the chances of infections.
According to Karolina Burczová, where the necessary protective measures are followed, similar infections are demonstrably fewer or the further spread of the disease agent can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treating MRSA is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is being fought everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written a program to prevent MRSA, or to reduce its occurrence.
The program appears to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England are showing a downward trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks the prevention of multi-resistant disease agents (including MRSA) or hospital infections caused by these disease agents among its priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion in the case of the police captain of the XXII. district, which caused a fatal accident, is ready.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII. district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who has since resigned from his post, was driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, informed a spokesman of the High State Prosecutor of the capital Attila Morvai on Friday, after the expert opinion of the case was completed.
The expert report confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation, which already stated that the former police captain did not drink any alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then director of the police headquarters of the XXII. district collided on Tuesday in Lajos Kossuth street in the XXII. district with his own car while turning a 55-year-old man who entered in front of him while crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The latter fact that the pedestrian was crossing off the zebra, moreover, according to the traffic rules is not an extenuating circumstance, the turning car must still give preference.)
After being transported to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Because of these events, the district police director stepped down and asked to be retired, according to police reports, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been cooperating with prosecutors conducting the investigation from the beginning.
A further 400 million euros for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks worth a total of EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed in Budapest on Friday by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework worth EUR 300 million for Hungary’s budget financing of transport and environment projects supported by the Cohesion Fund, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement for the amount of EUR 100 million, the agreement now signed relates to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A loan agreement worth EUR 150 million is also used for budget financing of school-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose, the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract for 50 million euros, which the budget will use primarily for the research and development project of Debrecen University.
There was also talk of a 4th metro line.
The parties have agreed that after Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the financing of the metro, it will return to whether and how the original contract needs to be modified.
This may happen in the first quarter of 2008, according to János Veres.
The EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary since 1990.
The interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment commission shall be linked to the EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astonishing - the attention of the whole of Europe turns to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the still cheapest, but fast-rising EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Undoubtedly, Bulgaria is now the most sought-after Eastern European destination for property purchases, with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seashore.
Of the mountains, the most popular are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Beach, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also attract interest from investors and more and more people are buying in the vicinity of the cheap city of Ruse.
The capital city of Sofia also promises attractive opportunities, while business and office space promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, becoming a popular destination for travel during the summer and winter seasons.
Predictive investors are already buying on a large scale, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and lifestyles at the same time.
Most of the customers come from England, but there are also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more often also from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the Black Sea and in ski paradises.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgy Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Residents buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or dilapidated old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication options, the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor is important for them.
The second category is chat buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a rise in value in the medium or long term.
Property prices in the capital are constantly rising as demand grows.
While Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, they have risen by 21 percent annually over the past five years.
The rise in house prices far exceeds the rise in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor said the meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and the international conference on the post-2012 climate regime will continue with talks after the official opening on Wednesday.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which addresses the efforts following the Kyoto Protocol's emissions reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there is a heated debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it now does not want to discuss the exact figures, although it is leaning toward an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 relative to 1990 levels.
Another big issue at the conference is whether developed countries will agree to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that rely on it in addition to reducing emissions.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member Governing Board, most likely under the United Nations’ World Environment Programme (GEF), according to the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungarian 6%
Hungary’s Minister for the Environment and Water, Gábor Fodor, supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection efforts and to help bring about a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and is ready to commit to a 30 percent reduction if other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments appropriate to their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set themselves a target of a 5.2% reduction, with the then 15 EU Member States committing to 8%.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will meet. - recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
There is a lot going on in Bali, as an international agreement on long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would certainly not be delayed until 2012. In that case, the reduction commitments set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed up by a new emissions reduction system, the necessity of which was also highlighted in the latest report by the UN's International Scientific Panel on Climate Change - the IPCC, which is the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay emissions reductions and inevitably increase the Earth’s average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British army recruits on YouTube
British military forces are posting videos of their own actions in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video-sharing server.
First, YouTube was popular with the British Air Force (RAF): special forces operating in Afghanistan since March 2006 are recording videos of actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera attached to a helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Headquarters controlling combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent on to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A Political Message is Inevitable
139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have been uploaded to the Internet, and more than 75,000 people have looked at their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and publishes recordings of events in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Force in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force has released videos according to their original intent to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good for acquainting the general public with the real goal of the army's presence abroad.
“The promotion published in this form costs almost nothing compared to traditional TV recruitment ads,” defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, “but it also necessarily carries a certain political message, as it confirms in a special way the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government.”
The Americans made a game.
The army is worried that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also being uploaded to the server, capturing, for example, the deaths of soldiers: in somewhat hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers at most talk about losses, but the bloody form of the fight is not shown.
Indeed, many videos from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have been made available on the Internet, but the British army has only just found them.
Americans recruit a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can through more or less faithful simulation get directly into the skin of the soldiers.
There'll be Christmas with raffles and pimps at the ministries
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, at which she will say goodbye to parrots and coffee in 2007.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, elsewhere it will conjure up the Christmas atmosphere with a raffle and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how the powerful have fun.
Government agencies are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive Ministerial Christmas celebration will be held by the Ministry of Defence this year, but it does not expect its employees to attend.
Children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts at Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions will receive gifts at Mission Christmas, but they will also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort will donate 25 million to the atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will kick themselves out compared to other departments.
The GKM party is held in the center of Yuvuz Háza, for a total of 4,320,000 forints, and of the six hundred employees of the ministry, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will hold Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and raffles.
The NF's Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday at the State Council of Justice (OIT) building - concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one department is invited to another Christmas party: the company running the tenders, the Hungarian Center for Economic Development (MAG) with EU money.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the Vígszínház Theatre.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we were not able to reach the person concerned.
No need for a suit
The OIT building did not only host the NFA, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which hosted the St. Lucia Ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
However, the OIT did not want money from him for the use of its halls.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party began with a salutation from the minister, after dinner it was possible to dance accompanied by live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball, evening dresses or a suit were not mandatory at all.
The Puritan party is being prepared by health, labor and local government departments.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth even officially invites her co-workers not to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
It counts one hundred and eighty guests, who, according to the press department, will receive only coffee and pates, so that only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Gordon Bajnai, the Minister of Local Governments, and his colleagues simply drink in the auditorium of the Ministry of Local Governments and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting, where 436 workers are expected, in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party, he donates 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with buffets and a toast.
Since Minister János Veres, PM workers celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missed, the officialness amplifies not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time of the event.
The Ministry of Agriculture organizes a New Year's reception on January 20, the Ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place in the castle Vajdahunyadvár in the City Park and according to the Ministry’s statement, there are 1,000 forints per person for 100 guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief greeting from the minister and end with a small treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize Christmas parties at all, the relevant press departments told the portal [origo].
They were not able to announce the price of the environmental department's Christmas celebrations in the press department.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Decorative Arts.
It's going on a giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the National Union of Workers’ Councils (MOSZ) will set up their strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday’s strike.
A protest public meeting is held on Saturday, and work will be halted on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The event will certainly cause serious traffic disruptions, as rail traffic will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be on strike by 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League and the National Union of Workers' Councils will present the details of Monday's jointly organized strike.
The League-Mosz strike committee will also be set up to coordinate the event on Monday.
A public protest rally is held on Saturday, with unions joining the strike on Monday halting open-ended work unless an agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no date has been set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If the Health Insurance Act is not passed by Parliament, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the legislation is voted on, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next course of action.
It is also possible that the bill on health insurance will be voted on in the late evening or at night, according to the Parliament's Monday agenda.
Due to the start of the strike on Monday, serious traffic interruptions can be expected: work on the railway will be stopped indefinitely, part of Budapest’s public transport can be stopped in the morning, and more than half of Volán’s companies.
At the same time, in many places of the country, the road will also be closed half way.
Numerous trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations announced a strike for an indefinite period, others declared a temporary halt to work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV) and the Independent Railway Workers' Union (VDSZSZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, yet more and more people are travelling by rail at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to the current announcements, the BKV will be on strike until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., the four-hour strike will be organized by the LIGA trade unions of workers in the energy industry, and the trade union of educators and the Democratic trade union of educators have called for a 2- or 2-hour stop in work.
The Association of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), belonging to the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is organizing a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is for the government to withdraw the health insurance reform proposal and present a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of counting pensions should be introduced gradually from next year.
The third is to ensure that early retirement for the relevant fields of work can be included in the scheme before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), which is part of the Liga trade union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Raises Country Risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, have increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysing Division of the Political Capital Institute.
The company's "risk warning" states: "In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that violent ethnic clashes may also occur in the short term by sharpening the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Romani population of Hungary."
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably aimed at provoking such an action - adds the research institute.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the greatest negligences of Hungarian political leaders: "public discussion of the Romani issue was left to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Romani-Hungarian conflict."
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, the work of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, was influenced by the great attention of domestic and foreign media "to a large extent spoiled the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of faith in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity."
The Institute recalls: as part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups, which has received increasing publicity and vehemence since the autumn of 2006, several organizations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, calling themselves "national self-defense" associations.
"The common feature of these groupings is that they define themselves as civic associations, while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the case of natural disasters, invasion of the homeland, disruption of order), moreover, pointing to the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state," she adds.
He further notes: all this is done in a way that seeks to wrap up the various political efforts built on society’s resistance to politics and parties in civilian garb.
Thus, emphasising civility and the form of association in the case of these groupings not only serves to avoid legal pitfalls of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also an increase in risk from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
“In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, while ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries, citing the formation of the Hungarian Guard, want to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policies.
All of this can affect the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, he writes, is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
On the background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass Romani riots that broke out in one of Sofia's districts (Krasna Poljana).
She used the BNU to establish the Guard, saying the organization's goal was "national self-defense."
For the past 17 years, there has been “gypsy terror” in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a heated debate among the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement of some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will form their own guard as a sign of resistance.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard to date are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is possible that the Hungarian Roma will react to the threat in a similar way by establishing their own militia, we can read in the risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
Asked by the press office, Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital Institute, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis every year, and if they find anything that could affect the change in risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not free everywhere.
In Hungary, the days off are precisely set by law and it has already become common practice to move working days around the holidays, which is less likely to happen next year.
In the European Union and America, holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and holidays.
Rest days are usually associated with church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a working holiday - on New Year's Day, so that people can relax after New Year's Eve.
During the year we have a total of 11 free holidays.
The national holiday is March 15, celebrating the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, commemorating the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20 we celebrate the establishment of the state, May 1 work, November 1 and 2 we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, the two-day holidays are Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on the calendar for the weekend, it has become the practice to move the working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price for long weekends, however, is that we stay in the workplace and at school on the previous Saturdays.
The day immediately preceding or following the holiday has been regulated for many years by a special decree issued by the Minister of Labour.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and their employees, to public employees and to persons in the public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or operate on non-working days with regard to their determination.
This year, the working rules will be changed only around the end of the year: from 24 December, life in the country will almost stop, because according to previous experience, most people will work out the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve in advance or use the saved holidays in this way.
Next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle, respectively, at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around Labor Day so that workers can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day, so that Friday 2 May can be a day of rest.
The next shift is related to the 23rd of October: on Saturday, October 18th, work will be done instead of Friday, October 24th.
However, the end of the year next year will be held entirely in the name of holidays, because from December 24 they will have non-stop holidays almost everywhere, even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
6 Little Things You Can Do to Annoy Your Colleagues
Emails we forget to send, voicemails we never get, innocent lies we barely notice anymore: all of this “diversifies” the workdays of the workplace.
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences, or put on gloves and avoid unclear situations that can make others angry.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague tells you.
You missed a meeting because of that?
At best, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or calls the marketing department and says he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
Most of the time, it is solved with an apology.
Before making an embarrassing apology, it’s a good idea to think about what you can do to make your colleagues uncomfortable, and consciously try to avoid it.
Do you borrow something that isn’t yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than reaching out for a document, office supplies, or your phone, and they’re not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on your table last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or have you found a pen on one of your colleagues’ desks that you thought was lost?
Without permission, do not take anything from your colleagues, otherwise they will be right to be angry at you for going through their things.
Don’t take envelopes or sticky notes out of your office, as they can be annoying if you run out of them early, and you’ll need them immediately.
Talk about the private life of your colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the rumors spreading.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t give everyone your personal information!
When one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even if others know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report your absence, citing a severe headache, because you are not feeling well, or you think that today you would rather rest, keep in mind that your work, urgent tasks and work, which have a certain deadline, will have to be done for you by someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day, or that something may happen that will make you need to stay at home, report it so that your colleagues and managers are not confronted with your absence the next day.
Humming, giggling, phoning
Did you get into a job where you were rudely ripped off by a colleague’s giggles?
Have you inadvertently witnessed a phone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not disturb your co-workers by humming, chanting, loud talk (over their heads), or stomping, constant swearing, loud discontent.
All this can be distracting even if they are not currently engaged in any project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If something is not on time or you forgot to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Do not refer to any chaos in the office and noisy colleagues!
Acknowledge if you have made a mistake and someone has paid for it, and make amends!
Ask how you could fix things, correct negligence!
Do you feel at home in the office?
Sweatpants and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear casual clothing, even if your profession allows it!
Don’t be sloppy, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in a casual dress - and if your profession demands it, nice and elegant!
When a man wants to please, he ceases to be interesting
Driving in the usual morning traffic.
A special melody is heard from the radio: the sound of the violin, which is joined by electronic effects.
I'm adding volume.
The music changes tempo and bass is added to the previous tone tones, then a female choir is added as a real gem.
On the mr2 station is a song by the band Zagar called Wings of Love.
Home music has not spoiled us with high-quality electronic pop for a long time.
Suddenly, however, the traffic looks quite different, because you are listening to the new album Zagaru.
The appearance of Yonderboi, a couple of new and interesting productions coming from the domestic digital underground, is slowly changing the overall picture, and although garage rock is in vogue again with its beating on the guitar, even the home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Five-Churches and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until eventually - perhaps because two bagpipes do not fit into one wizard - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film by Ferenc T?r?k "Szezon").
His formations, which began in smaller clubs, were recognized by a wider audience after wan2 ranked their first album in 2002 among the 50 most important home albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboie to be almost the only domestic developmental entity that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "on course", although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this label.
The band reacted as they should: they made a new, better album.
The now-released album, Cannot Walk Fly Instead, may open up new paths for them, though the name itself attempts to create a continuity with the early years in Five-Bed.
It is one verse from the composition of Balázs Zságer's old band there.
A reference to ethereal, flying would be appropriate, but next to the ethereal touch of this music has now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time - louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
These songs were performed at the premiere of the album in the Millenáris Park by the lead singer of the English band The Puzzle, Gyergy Ligeti.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Pet-fi, playing popular music recently from morning to evening, we began to experience the swinging melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six home singers ("Underground Divas").
So all is well (?).
The hvg.hu portal interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question arises, how much of what you play remains marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of marginal music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don’t say anything, and it can just be created just for the sake of selling, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can stem from a sincere inner need.
It is in this spirit that the attitude, as adopted, operates independently of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in their 20s, but also older.
They are much more aware of the transformations of light music taking place around them, as they also consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, and how much of your music you listen to?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born with a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived more at concerts, where mutual influence already works, but it is hidden only in the elusive changes of the moment.
Yet I have noticed that when one wants to please the audience, from that moment on it ceases to be interesting.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works as a soloist and has built his career from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don’t really follow his path, regardless of the fact that our music is sometimes trying to explain it.
Rather, we are team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first, of course, there was no way to avoid comparing our work to Yonderboi's songs, as several of us separated from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the toplist of the station mr2 Petefi, the song Wings of Love got to the first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, have you consciously opened yourself up to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We didn’t plan to write a hit that would sell the record.
There's more to the song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
Q. How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then the idea came to assemble this choir from soloists of the domestic music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik - Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then christened Underground Divas.
HVG.HU: Is that exactly what you intended the song to be, or did the girls transform it into something?
B.Zs.: The song had long existed in the instrumental version, when the material on the record came together, we thought that there would be something else needed for this song.
A series of chords led him to join the singing part.
That night, I sang a melody to him that was later learned by the girls.
The whole thing came out almost at first and very spontaneously.
I remember it coming back to life, but of course it took Wonders.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so energetically.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
They don't have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing together completely and they're no louder than music, so the music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They were also at the back of the stage.
On purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to split up the solo roles, on the contrary, is intentional.
Even that song is about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where someone is from, where they belong, and just letting ourselves be raised by those wings, wings of love.
I wish that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born could be felt by others.
Q. What was the most work?
B.Zs.: When composing music, not even with one, heavier pieces were more likely to occur when mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where groove did not want to work for a long time, then everything slowly found its place in a jigsaw puzzle.
Q. Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That changes all the time when I have already "released" the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A traitorous broker risked billions on inferiority
Treacherous embezzler.
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the domestic Komerční banka, refers to its former employee Jerome Kerviel.
He lost almost 5 billion euros because of it.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to match his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all major banking houses, he early recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He's mentally weaker," said his superiors, who sent police after him.
But according to Kerviel’s testimony, published by French media, such as Le Monde, he was the man who made 1.6 billion euros in profits from his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros from the US crisis.
He saw the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to surface that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had repayment problems in the past, would have problems.
The whole economy was not affected by this crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet it right.
At the end of the year, its profits reached 1.6 billion euros.
“When I made my first half-billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn’t keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he falsified the records so they wouldn't come to him.
He even managed to fool the bosses, although Eurex became interested in his trades.
Risk was a profit
Was he afraid he would find out?
I don't think so.
"I thought just the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to risk so much?
He had to gradually work his way up to the position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became a separate broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew he would never earn as much as everyone else.
“As early as my first interview in 2005, I knew they were staring at me.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the start came the first big success.
Allianz made a profit from the London bombings, betting half a billion euros on the decline.
And that was the trigger - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told police.
But the bosses knew all about it, or rather suspected it.
"As long as I was making money, they were closing their eyes."
But then came the morning of the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
After a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cover it up.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
A few days later, the bank reported that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who isn't on leave is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look at his records," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to raise 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can receive EUR 14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion of the seven operational programmes will go to regions.
Czech companies will be able to get around CZK 100 billion from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, up to $150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic has so far been one of the least successful countries in drawing money from EU funds.
Nicaragua's 20-year sentence upheld by court
Nicaragua's appeals court on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former president Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of $100 million in financial fraud.
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of the Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison is unclear at this time.
According to Ileana Perez, the president of the appeals court, it will now be up to the prison officials whether they let Alemán serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that he regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious, and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to fund his 2001 election campaign.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year it passed with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The Chamber of Deputies has traditionally overlooked this, although the most influential, the law has been quietly passed.
It's a paradox.
Every rule begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government’s power rivalry with the opposition.
This is more media-gratitude, and therefore much more attention is paid to it in the media.
The arguments of politicians are much more interesting to the public than the stark figures.
State budgets in previous Social Democratic governments have suffered from three ills that the 2008 one is unable to solve all at once:
The first is a high proportion of statutory, so-called mandatory expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved by the silent "coalition" of the CSSD and the KSČM last year before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the first.
The third limit is public finance deficits, i.e. budget deficits of towns and municipalities.
But the biggest risk is not the budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
However, the time bomb is the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to money from taxes, fees, and loans from banks, often recklessly issue bonds disproportionately in debt to their city halls.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other grids they have received from the state in privatizations.
They no longer have that resource.
If we stick to the official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, like the rest of the world, which is constantly boasting of ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the government became more and more indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more wisely than our Republic.
This is a huge embarrassment, especially for previous governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which have, unfortunately, just in recent years become unnecessarily swollen to gigantic proportions.
Even if some of the nonsensical populist spending approved this year before the election has been scrapped, if the retirement threshold and pension reform are not pushed any time soon, then virtually any politics in this country will be over, and whoever governs will be in office.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically distributing the majority of the taxed money for pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the squeeze-out of normal spending by mandatory spending.
The projected deficit of $70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if past governments had not done what they could over the past decade.
If we do not want the ruling politicians to become mere officials, then we must be patient and allow this not-so-strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can in taxes and fees, peace to prepare further reform laws.
Only this will allow the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly fight the crisis in the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will be auctioned into currency markets.
In these auctions, the banks are auctioning the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the Fed will auction off $40 billion and make 24 more available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that national central banks have agreed on such coordinated action to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
“This move is intended to address the biggest economic difficulties, the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report to clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to non-performing loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more.
“Central banks must be really worried about what else they might do when they decide to do this,” said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are worried that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend to their customers more expensively.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
Central banks have failed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about mutual lending, even though central banks in the US, Canada, and Britain had cut their interest rates several times over the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move by central banks will help to avoid the crisis, because it does not solve the basic problem, and that is the collapse of the real estate market in the US.
The environmental debate is incredible.
Global climate change is most damaging to developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus has once again commented on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been levelled at the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not the Green Planet, he said that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, consisting of a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President emphasized that its topic is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book appears in German translation as well, because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my views".
Now people can read his unbiased views.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, in his opinion he has enough prerequisites for writing such a book.
He is an academic who is able to observe and judge scientific papers, has experience with statistics, and is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are normal, that there is no consensus among all scientists about the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totalitarianism, he considers imposing unproven opinions on others unacceptable, which he feels is a dangerous restriction of freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits."
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver’s license could not be changed by 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to exchange their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for a replacement so that the authorities can issue a new card before the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would be put on the road after the New Year without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the card was not exchanged mainly by those who do not want to drive anymore.
While municipalities are reporting a sharp decline in interest in changing their driver's license, authorities in the capital are overwhelmed by requests and interest in changing their license has increased this week.
The city handles about 2000 clients a day.
We waited in the queues for about half an hour.
About 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licences in Prague.
It takes 20 days to issue a new card.
However, it is possible to apply for extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who fail to change their licence by the end of the year and drive on the road without a valid driver’s license will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police officer can also deal with the offence by agreement.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine will amount to CZK 2,500.
According to previous information, even a person who is not going anywhere could be fined by the town hall.
He could have paid 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has previously called on the authorities to be moderate and to impose a maximum fine of CZK 1,000.
According to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, there is no risk of fines of 10,000 euros.
According to him, a driving license is a document that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not an identity card that every person must have.
People who don’t want to drive anymore should give up their driver’s license.
Just take it away or send it by registered mail to the relevant municipal office.
At the end of the year, passports issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
Drivers will also need to change their driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the sentences of detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are charged with criminal conspiracy with the gang of David Berdych, will be sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Prague High Court, which thus reduced their sentences for one year and the other for two years, has finally decided on this.
Originally, the detectives of the Prague Department for Combating Organized Crime were threatened with 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also indicted in this case, but he is still awaiting a first-instance verdict.
In other cases, he was sentenced to more than 16 years in prison.
That's all he can get.
In January, the regional court recognized 19 people guilty of participating in robberies, and the Supreme Court today dealt with the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have denied the charge since the beginning of the investigation, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, among other things, passed on information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave 30 percent for Opava and Koňařík.
The charges are gang crime from 1999 to 2001.
Especially about the robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious harm to health, but also about the abuse of the power of a public official and illegal armaments.
During house searches, police discovered illegal pistols, steel-core bullets, a laser sighting or a submachine gun.
The gang has been accused of looting tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly twenty men in the process, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of other people guilty of other robberies.
Other men from the Berdych area are still interrogating before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The trial has so far been avoided by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Child exchange account: 12 million
For the replacement of children in the maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured families, Igor Veleba, wants compensation of CZK 12 million for the Třebíč hospital, plus court costs.
For each of the mothers of three million, for the father of two million, and for the children of one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of $200,000 for each parent.
The hospital’s attorney, Ondřej Dostál, strongly disagrees with Veleba’s proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," he said after today's meeting.
"But in order to make an opinion about the counterproposal, we need an expert opinion, which the opposing party had prepared.
Let's see if it has any telling value at all.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for all," said Dostál.
The amount should be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for each month when they were not raising their biological daughter.
Veleb used an expert opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motola as a basis for negotiations on compensation.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the children’s parents suffered psychological damage and stress in varying degrees and depths.
Men were better able to endure the stressful situation, even though they struggled with the regrets that they had not prevented the confusion of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, are more difficult to cope with the actuality of the trauma experienced and with what is happening right now, summed up the contents of Veleb.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč maternity hospital on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermáková to Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Broža and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Vysočina Governor Miloš Vystrčil handed over CZK 100,000 to each of the families to reimburse them for the expenses incurred by the mistake of the Třebíč hospital, which the region is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured against liability.
In case of misconduct, they must go to the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for help from the founder.
Courts have so far awarded relatively low compensation to people, the sums were calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
The Soup of the Wallachian Kingdom
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand of the Wallachian Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, although he first used the name Wallachian King, the project built a long-term work team around Tomáš Harabiš, who cooperated with the actor.
The soup was not at the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team parasitizing Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
In the words of the Wallachian Kingdom, everyone remembers an actor and a comedian.
The same view is held by Harabis.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
To raise money and make up actions," he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
Years later, they realized that the project was successful and could have something to gain from it.
They want to parasitize on our work," he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the Wallachian king used the designation Polívka for the first time in his TV show.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, this had nothing to do with the idea of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionary event turned into a business and lucrative business activity, which Harabiš then followed up with the founding of the Wallachian Kingdom company.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to include his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to their holders when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only used the bare idea that Polivka published in a manner for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, which intensively devoted to him.
The cooperation of today’s contentious parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polivka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polívka and Harabiš have started to accumulate, culminating in the deposing of "the king of Boleslav I elected on a still".
At the instigation of Harabiš, singer Jarmila Šuláková took the leading role in the kingdom as the queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
It is clear that Harabish could bring about a contest for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
The details and deadline have not yet been announced.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It should be something like the ride of kings in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Polívka can join in," added Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearing prejudices
In fact, I’ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of shifting, steering and also production could sometimes be described as below average.
But the successor to the Peugeot 207 is now on the market, and it is much better.
And the wagon called SW goes a bit further and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about the headroom in the rear seats, for example.
This is the end of the grievance here, because the wagon body means that not even the two-meter-long ones will suffer in this direction.
Flying the World
I'm going through the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty cool design, where my only complaint is about a poor middle tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design invention, since the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The sideline has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As for the space, there is also an increase in the dimensions of the body.
In the wagon, the already mentioned lack of space above the head disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing about this car is its luggage.
I have to evaluate it as very accessible (thanks to the tilting rear window) and as decently storable.
Deaf spots are equipped with retaining rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not interfere, it can be stretched and at the same time can hold even heavier objects.
But let's pause on the volume together.
According to the tables in the basic layout, it is 428 l, which is more than the average value compared to the competition.
Not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot lags by a very noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when loading the stroller, this value is critical.
But if I have to highlight the positives, I still have to mention a completely flat floor after folding the backrests of the second row or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre petrol four-cylinder engine with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old who drives a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has little consumption and, above all, pulls.
If I compare it to the Škoda equivalent, which sometimes looks like it has a rag stuffed into the exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
The price list will tell
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a petrol fourteen hundred for 329 900 CZK still goes.
Our unit costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment then throws in the equipment for an additional 80,000 CZK on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, electric control of the rear windows...
The car costs 531,900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count the extra gear at Fabia and you'll come to a lot of a similar number.
So I have to decide on the label.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not successful
The number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing in British schools, raising concerns among local residents about the further development of local schools.
Meanwhile, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools have even registered cases where disputes between immigrants and Indigenous children have escalated into violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Controversy, bullying, and fights between students have also spilled over into parent-child relationships.
The situation went so far that police in Chatham detained a Slovak woman who was beating a 10-year-old student with an iron pole.
The accused pleaded guilty to insulting her with racist insults.
Police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls reportedly chided the man with racist remarks and threw rocks at him.
“When we got home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us, and then he revealed his ass," the mother of Slovak pupils described another unpleasant incident to The Times.
Complaints are from both sides.
One local resident even called disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools among locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in the UK to work there.
About 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
The most beautiful island in the Caribbean
It is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can come true for you if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
Only on one island you will find much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the stronghold of their conquest of America.
Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a treasure dump, which the Spaniards looted in America and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the very end of the 1920s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the USA (especially during Prohibition) was welcomed and promoted in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise houses were built in Havana, and cars were used on the wide boulevards, which were among the iconic symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paula, just outside Havana, and had his yacht in Cojímar.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio were left their signatures stars of show business and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls in Havana’s Bodeguita.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you can prepare a cocktail according to your wishes.
And those iconic cars from the 1950s still drive around Havana, because the gills and fiats that were once imported in that salty and humid air have long since rotted away.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is very dilapidated, there are not so many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there.
Other places are also becoming more beautiful, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings much-needed money, its development is green.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province, as well as on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more pleasure, which is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by train drivers.
Steam and motor trains carried reeds from large plantations to sugar factories on narrow tracks.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, so there are working machines, whose contours are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not miss.
There is no need to talk much about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps just to remind that in the already mentioned Hemingway homestead there is a museum, and who likes this writer should not miss a visit.
Viňales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viňales Valley in the west of the island.
The luxuriant vegetation grows out of the limestone bedrock.
Mogotes, limestones and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil takes hold in their cavities, thanks to which even weathered rocks are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be seen if you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also be interesting for some to know that the Chilean version of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave trade and the sugar trade brought him fame and wealth.
Wealth was transformed into the beauty and display of a small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, greatly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that it was not until the 1950s that there was a road connecting the region with the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him to stay away.
Nothing was being built there, and therefore nothing was happening, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more time in Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth taking a look at interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancón, or the Sugar Valley.
In the evening, it is advisable to go to Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music is silent in the morning.
Baracoa
A small town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely, this view is already influenced by the journey itself.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo have to cross high and rugged mountains and go through nature that has hardly been affected by human activity.
The eastern outpost of Cuba has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
They make the best chocolate there, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (in fact, it originated about a hundred years after Columbus' voyage), and from the hill where the former castle stands and today's Hotel El Castillo, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, santeria, the African religions professed by the descendants of former slaves, many pages could be written about.
But, as they say, better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are 'passive', says US
According to the United States, few troops and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, the leaders of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh.
In addition to growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, urged NATO troops to do more, the United Kingdom sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and stepping up development assistance.
"Development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start developing the economy and security themselves," Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is at its highest in five years, according to U.S. military data.
The number of violent attacks increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, while in the southern province of Helmand it increased by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the Allies have reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
"We're going to have to think seriously about specific targets for the coming time and how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been controversy among the participating countries in recent months about whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the combat demands are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British tabloid The Sun called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan bums exposed: Germans playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in the material, accompanied by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild counterattacked and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt rises to $1 trillion in 2009
For every Czech there is a national debt of over 84,000 crowns.
By the end of September, the total debt had risen to CZK 842.7 billion.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better developments in the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has decreased by CZK 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed today its data on the state debt from the beginning of October.
For every Czech there is a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state has been in debt by more than 111 billion crowns.
“For now, it seems that the lower deficit for next year will allow us to exceed the one trillion crown mark only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told news server iHNed.cz.
Vladimir Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, said: “We could exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
I do not expect this change,” he said.
Debts are growing
Government debt consists of central government debts and is mainly caused by the accumulation of government deficits.
Government debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or loans from the European Investment Bank.
So far this year, the internal debt of the state has risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
So far this year, the state’s external debt has risen by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called negotiable national debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt increased to 6.5 years.
“Overall debt rose 13 percent year-on-year in the first to third quarters, which is a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly for bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade when there is a pension reform,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
The strategy for financing and managing the national debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better developments in the state budget.
The amount consists mainly of the state budget deficit, which is expected to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the expected CZK 91.3 billion.
It also includes the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, financing of state bonds for CZK 43 billion and repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear in court today in Khartoum for giving her name to a teddy bear.
A British teacher on trial in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday evening, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting six- to seven-year-old pupils give the teddy bear the name Muhammad, despite the fact that any depiction of the Prophet of Islam is prohibited.
She was subjected to whip-wound punishment.
The 54-year-old British teacher, who works at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of Sudan's Penal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, our story begins in the month of September, when the teacher asks his six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for a class teddy bear.
"From the mouth of the children will be heard eight names, among them Hasan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
After the class votes, 20 of the 23 children choose Mohamed as their favorite name.
Of course Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but most of all it is a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photo of a teddy bear accompanied by a caption: "My name is Muhammad".
The teddy bear itself had no label with the name on it, but the trouble is in the very depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a fellow Muslim who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her well and would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: “I only regret asking children to vote for a name,” he said.
This view is shared by many of the teacher's pupils, who describe her as "very attentive to her pupils" and add that "she never talks about religion in class".
The given name Muhammad is also the second most commonly given given given first name in the UK, in English it is spelled fourteen different ways.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to give them a toy?
Of course, it is a matter of interpretation.
In the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Ultimately failure.
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome differing views on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were unable to reach an agreement on the status," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is "at stake" and called on Belgrade and Pristina to heed their commitments to keep the peace and be ready for dialogue even after negotiations are over.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he said, adding that "it is clear that the situation is tense".
Negotiations end on December 10
The Troika negotiators, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their final trip to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the population is Albanian-speaking, could be revealed in a brighter light as of Dec. 10, when Ischinger, Wisner, and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are due to hand over their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN mandated the troika to renegotiate in August this year.
Americans and Europeans expect the talks to end on December 10.
On the other hand, the Russians, who have previously blocked Kosovo’s independence from the UN Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
“Russia has been and remains in favor of a negotiated, compromise solution,” Bocan-Charchenko said.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance by the international community, the West sees Kosovo's independence under EU supervision as the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
“Unfortunately, we have not reached an agreement,” said Fatmir Sejdiu, president of Kosovo’s self-governing government, in a hotel in Baden, where “last-chance negotiations” have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and the province's future prime minister, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past that led to the murders and deportations".
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic, on the other hand, believes that a compromise is still under consideration, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo about the consequences of a possible unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "domino effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"This does not mean for Serbia," he said, "that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right of veto.
"Kosovo parliament will have final say"
"For Serbia, only a solution emanating from the Security Council is acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations took two years.
It must end as it began: on the Security Council floor."
Sedjiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the final say on status" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking residents, it would take place "by agreement" with the West.
Bush makes a deal with Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland convened at his behest, U.S. President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint statement.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to immediately begin negotiations to resolve the 60-year dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the responsibilities for both sides of the “road map” to peace they adopted in 2003.
He said the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, were aimed at “concluding a peace treaty that would resolve all pending issues without exception, including central issues.”
The statement includes three issues that are at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees displaced in the 1948 conflict in what is now the state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor after the US president, stressing that the ensuing negotiations should be "overall and thorough" and touch on all aspects of the solution, noting "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Olmert said the negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it is necessary to see that they are concluded in the course of 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the date for his "two-state vision," Palestinian and Israeli, existing side-by-side.
Saudi Arabia said it had made a commitment to this effect from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis has been a success for Washington, initiated a proposal accepted by all Arab countries offering peace to Israel in exchange for abandoning all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in Middle Eastern history, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview he gave to an Arabic-language newspaper backed by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the officers are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small news from the black chronicle, the official versions do not match what is said among the people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of an investigation by the Inspector General of the French State Police (IGPN), a police car drove through the rue Louise-Michel in Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in intervention mode, but was on patrol and was travelling at 40 to 50 km/h, without the side lights on," the police source explains.
Kawasaki's green motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore not authorized to ride on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, drove at "very high speed".
"The motorcycle crashed from the left side into the police car after not giving priority to the right," one police officer said.
A blood alcohol test carried out on the vehicle crew showed a negative result.
The condition of the car (punctured front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) testifies to the severity of the impact.
The Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérése de Givry responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had commissioned an investigation into "the acts of unintentional manslaughter and failure to provide assistance to persons in danger", which is also being undertaken by the direction départemente de la séreté publique du Val-d'Oise (Director).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
Three witnesses to the accident, who were interrogated on Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the police officers, namely, that the mini-bike approached them relatively quickly from the left."
A groove, no doubt caused by the friction of the clipsen to the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedged up until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened, right after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, rumors quickly spread among the people that police officers should have left the scene quickly without providing first aid to the two youths.
IGPN had, in all caution, also ruled out "any serious wrongdoing" at this point.
"This is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which one needs to be very careful," a police source said.
The newspaper "Libération" met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of the windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
“My cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, and I rushed down to try to resurrect them,” the witness said.
There was nothing we could do."
Then he saw "a limping, completely frightened policeman.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the youths, and a fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with rapidly increasing tension and the certainty that the situation of the youths was hopeless, police officers were taken by car to a colleague who had arrived at the scene in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one say that the police did not rush to help the young people.
These young people were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan.
Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first demonstrations since the declaration of a state of emergency by General Musharraf, two days earlier.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under the state of emergency, were injured by tear gas grenades, which, according to witnesses, were used by law enforcement forces.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were barred on Monday morning, in order to prevent rallies.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement gained the support of religious parties grouped in the politically powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "encouraged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and garbage to those who took the oath before Musharraf".
"Muzaraf's promise does not apply"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was due to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election, which took place on October 6.
Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, president of the court, was removed and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is unlawful, unconstitutional and against the judgments of the Supreme Court,” the official told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's pledge to give up military leadership and become a civilian president "does not apply" after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted ongoing speculation in the country that the deputy chief of the army should have ordered President Musharraf under house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies are unexpected.
This includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
More than one in three (36 percent) pregnancies are still unanticipated, according to a study led by the Institut national d’études démographiques (Ined), France’s state institute for demographic studies, forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which legalized contraception in France.
This includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
However, the enactment of contraception has allowed for better “fertility control,” the institute says, noting that the use of hormonal contraceptives among women between 20 and 44 years of age has now gone from 5% in 1970 to 60%.
After all, eight out of ten births today are well planned.
In fact, one in five couples will have their birth accurately calculated for the month and, if possible, in the spring, which is considered to be the most pleasant time of year for the birth of a child.
Remarkable Space Station Repair
More than seven hours of work in space required astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to remarkably repair the torn solar panel necessary for the station's continued scientific activity.
It was a risky spacewalk that set records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, speed at which it was planned, and the amount of "dwelling" that the astronauts spent to repair it.
The trouble arose on Tuesday while the Discovery astronauts unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical formation designed to install a European and Japanese science laboratory (see box).
This module is a kind of landing strip for modules-laboratories.
We need to be able to supply electricity.
The crew’s second task was to move the 17-gallon solar panel module, which was already on the ISS, to its final location.
After it was relocated, the crew began decomposing the module's 60-foot (67 m) solar panels.
And in this was one of the panels, unfolding like a pulling accordion, due to the clipping of the cable, damaged on an area of almost one meter.
Decomposition has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to make a control climb to the Discovery ship, and subsequently go to fix another solar panel whose rotation system had malfunctioned, were forced to attend to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, added to the arm of the station, and carry out the repair.
He is one of the best "spacewalkers" (spacewalker) of the U.S. Office of Aeronautics and Space (NASA).
Tall, stout, very agile, has a highly developed chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession of doctor was assigned to "operate" the "injured" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed some " splints" on the damaged areas.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the leveling chamber, and also from within, by other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, a mini-hockey stick coated with an insulating agent to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "do-it-yourself" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely decomposed and then inventoried his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as scheduled.
Shares of EADS are weakening
Shares of EADS are losing significantly on the Paris Stock Exchange after the airline, which operates in the aerospace and defense industries, announced it would have to spend 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to meet the A400M delay.
EADS has lost 4% and is now listed on the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21.96.
The financial group was forced to reassess its projected production results for 2007 due to delays resulting from the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the launch flight.
The cost of mitigating delays in the delivery of a military cargo aircraft, announced in October, has been quantified at "1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, more than a billion of which for Airbus," said EADS' parent company.
Because of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new earnings outlook before interest and taxes (EBIT) next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that the EADS production results fell by 86% in 2006 mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, namely the giant A380 aircraft.
Initially, the group expected to deliver the first A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
Decision for the status quo
Sunday’s election will be held without any expectation: the Russians will vote for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Affirming thus, after the end of the very little free election campaign, their preoccupation with stability, indeed with authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will give voters a pre-recorded television message on public television, but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so from the position of the leader of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that seems to celebrate a landslide victory.
When he received ambassadors of foreign states yesterday, the president let nothing out of him and settled for another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the value of true democracy and we wish for an honest, as transparent and open election as possible, an election without the slightest flaw in its beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They denounce a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "there has never been such a dirty election, not even under Yeltsin".
After the repression surrounding the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to be banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have remained the mentality of homo sovietica"
In the background of these parliamentary elections, which are devoid of tense expectations, there are two more open questions:
Who will be Putin’s successor in office?
The official newspaper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates may present themselves to the public until December 23.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third term in a row.
However, no follower appears.
What role will Putin play after March?
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, who chooses the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win outright in parliamentary elections, as well as in presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians still have the homo sovietica mentality, they do not feel that they are the masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg observes a more distant context: civil society, Christianized in this country five centuries after Europe, has been delayed; the glorious common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed a paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was accompanied not by terror, but by a certain economic well-being," believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today "voluntarily give up the personal responsibility" they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
Even the bureaucratic elite intend to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken over from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Tamara Cherednichenko, 54-year-old professor: "Why think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which recount the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler’s regime, are opening to the public.
47 million archival documents stored over 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were previously only accessible for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and by name, at the request of the former victim or his/her entitled persons.
The 11 states in charge of the archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is over, the opening up came into effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
Free access by historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to examine "in particular the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced labour," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, opposed making these nominal documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some of the information.
What are the presumed homosexuality or mental disabilities of some of the victims of deportation?
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants compiled by the Gestapo were gathered after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labor subjected to civilian citizens, bringing them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen still deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited benefit.
“Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Antisemitism at the Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
India and EU to reach free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India amounts to almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expected to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India already amounts to almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also the EU’s first foreign investor, but India is the EU’s ninth trading partner, according to the European Commission.
"The Free Trade Agreement will dope up both economies tremendously" and "India will gain better market access to 450 million prosperous Europeans", Peter Mandelson noted.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants will exchange "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services" each year. The EU and India will meet on Friday for the eighth summit of the European Commission in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential."

Bank of England takes note of concerns and offers 10 billion pounds in five-week auction
On Thursday, the Bank of England said it intended to ease current concerns that credit market conditions would once again deteriorate and announced a 10-billion-pound bid at a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an offer that has been in place for an unusually long time.
“In an effort to ease fears that conditions in financial markets will be very unfavourable by the end of the year and to give banks more certainty about how to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will begin on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation,” the statement said.
The bank specifies that the 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be placed on the financial market at 12:15 GMT on December 6 until January 10, at the basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time that BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open-market operation.
Normally it takes a week.
BOE adds in its communiqué that it "remains ready to take further measures to keep interest rates" of interbank loans on a daily basis at par with its base rate.
The interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has settled at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to fee rates that have discouraged banks from taking advantage of this offer.
According to some speculation boosted by the development of the pound against the euro, many preferred to opt for amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for a Popular Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to address the Socialists' (PS) proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss individual paragraphs of the socialist buy-back bill on Thursday, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text of the bill came on the agenda as part of the so-called socialist "nest" (a meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary group) and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS presidency, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the renewal of the fluctuating TIPP, a traffic check or rent regulation.
As the UMP and NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the session was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an opinion exchange, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised buyability speech.
PS MP Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club would resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the finance bill, which will be debated by the House next week.
A new festival is born.
As a result of much speculation that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey, in association with the Republic Festival, was announced by British promoter Melvin Benn.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with the person who has inspired the contemporary festival movement in America without exaggeration,” said Charlie Jones, C3’s director of international music at Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago's Lollapalooza Festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is the summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a private 500-acre farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s most respected festival organisers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, attracting 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 the Republic Festival established the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Beginning in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also in charge of production, licensing and organizing assignments at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he has ever experienced, and says his firm and Melvin Benna's firm are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival event.
“We originally chose Philadelphia as our market and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to set up a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
"We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
Unfortunately, however, we have become mired in politics because of the current management of the city, adds Charlie Jones.
“Luckily, we had the opportunity to discuss this with Melvin Benn and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional location that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005, after they excelled on the festival scene by hosting the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross sales of both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M respectively.
Both festivals take place in an urban environment.
“The Melvin Benn European model takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in green spaces in cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to somehow combine both concepts to create both the impression of a rural festival in Europe and an urban festival in America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is excited to support the realization of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to divulge the terms of the deal, but says "they are sufficiently advantageous to allow investment in such an event and to welcome a festival that will hopefully have a long duration."
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which can accommodate 80,000 people.
He says invitations have already been sent out to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed when the program is still in print.
“Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music will be varied to attract a wide audience if possible,” Jones said.
C3's partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award in the final year of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it.
This persuasion mission is one of the delegate's tasks.
But his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall into the "Governor"'s claws??
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he will go there.
Our job is to offer the ones they think are the best,” he said.
The Hunt for Festivals
For now, however, Denise Turcotte's priority is to promote the local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether it’s in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it’s about introducing Quebec films, drawing attention to them, and making sure directors give interviews.
The Age of Darkness was well publicized at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer at Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also presented four short and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon on the stock market at the end of the year? Experts have divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and investors are already holding my hands in anticipation of a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
But this year, experts aren’t so sure it will happen.
Banif believes that "statistically, the month of December has a positive course on the stock exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to make predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in the current context, the markets offer some doubts, at least in the short term."
These experts don’t expect the stock exchange to move in the last few weeks of the year, stating that “the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income affected by the effect of the turnaround to high-quality securities, both in the long and short periods.”
Therefore, they believe that the exchange will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, “primarily because the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inflationary pressure stimuli.”
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the time to make bold statements about a marathon.
"There's not much to be happy about," the expert assures.
Ibex lost nearly 4% of its peak on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to portfolio reallocations and traditional supplementary pension deposits occurring annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that things will be a little different this year, as he believes the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December, after a long weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
The analyst in question does not believe that volatility will affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching technical levels and “therefore we could observe an index rebound, triggered by reports from the US about the consequences of the credit market crisis.”
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles to drive Ibex to new maximums.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is the turn for strong titles".
The expert would include both major banks and some construction firms in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, by contrast, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves at this marathon if it happens.
“ACS has been regaining its position for several months now and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and the FCC will follow the same path,” he said.
Cyclic consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technology will also do very well, even if they are not very represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of slumps in two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year (Ibex has so far increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Bank Popular has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decided to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 8.30 pm and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 8.30 pm.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly assured that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
Meanwhile, it plans to strike a deal with unions to close 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of its opening hours by one afternoon, though not for the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be decisive for others to join or not to join the initiative, which supports trade opening hours.
This is exactly the aim of the project, which was set by the bank Popular.
To get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, self-employed people and shops from selected streets, where branches will be opened.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, as this is not about opening new branches, but only about modifying existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernize the branches it already has in the business zones by adapting them to the profile of the clients in the individual streets.
The extension of opening hours is complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colours.
Ángel Rivera, the bank’s chief commercial officer, assures that this restructuring will not entail a large investment, but more recruitment, as it shifts from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three branches in Madrid.
And it was a positive experience, Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía were selected and, according to Rivera, this seems to have been a happy choice.
The Bank Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specialized immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax affiliates will not follow the BBVA model, with a number of its affiliates offering a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our clients,” Rivera said.
They've just reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell their phones through external personnel.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We did it.
Paolo Vasile, Telecinco’s executive chairman, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the deal yesterday, stating that the television he controlled had doubled the value of its rival Antena 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'what I regret is that it was not because we had grown more, but because we had fallen less,' he said.
And he stressed that because of the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended trading yesterday with a 2.54% shift.
That profit pushed their loss for the past part of the year to 15.86%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with Vocento (another 13%), according to Bloomberg data, reaches 4,488.88 million euros.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and has fallen 40.5% since January, is worth $2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that were rated is 3.571 billion for Sogecable, 2,518.53 million for Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is offered because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we evaluate it in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first TV channel to surpass a billion gross ad revenue this year, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespana, the affiliate that runs the group's advertising.
If the forecast was actually achieved, this TV channel would see an increase in advertising revenue of 3.6% this year, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, Antena 3’s net sales increased by 1.6% (to reach 734.4 million) in the first nine months of the year, while its net revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on for Telecinco’s best relative development on the stock exchange is the increased pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, split 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33 percent of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, to whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its Telecinco profit estimates by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected revenue growth stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antena 3’s projected profit by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress Approves MiFID Transposition Effective November 1
In parallel to the parliamentary deliberations that concluded today with a Congressional vote on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has submitted to a public hearing a regulation that is being developed by the new bill, with the goal that both enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of individual parties have consistently praised the efforts of MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities needed for the efficient functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory bodies of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable the provision of financial advisory services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (AFIs) that join securities companies, securities brokerage offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments is expanding, with MTFs and order internalisation systems joining regulated secondary markets to compete with current stockbrokers.
The law also obliges firms providing investment services to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and ways of dealing with risk, and requires a statement of all operations performed to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During deliberations on the Congressional Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among which stand out that securitised receivables should be considered a "complicated" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor that has been demonstrated by what has occurred in the US with high-risk subprime mortgage debt.
Moreover, the transposition of the directive has been used to legally define the functions that can be held by bachelors in economics and business management 30 years after the Royal Decree was passed in 1977, which outlines the professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC rises five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data of a time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final figure, which will become known on 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to maintain a relatively high level"
Pedro Solbes, the second deputy prime minister and economy minister, said the ISC's rise to 4.1% in November was "temporary" but also predicted that the price index would remain at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has made clear in Congress’s corridors that “although this will not be a favorable number,” Spain’s inflation differential with regard to the monetary union has remained “more or less” the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the economy minister said in a statement.
Virgin plans to make 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have plummeted by more than 50% to as much as 12 billion pounds ($16.8 billion).
At the time, the bank was managing record deposits worth more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually fell in disbelief over two and a half months, despite the government offering a 100% guarantee for the money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which replaces the name with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to raise around a quarter of the revenue it has put into British banks over the next three years to raise the remaining ?18 billion to reach the ?30 billion target.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom for his conspicuous advertising campaigns, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named Virgin’s bid, which includes three other companies, as the one they prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana Arrested for Alleged Corruption in Construction
In the early hours of this morning, the Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murciy town of Totana (from the People's Party) for his alleged involvement in the construction corruption practices that were revealed this week.
In addition, one of the town hall's secretaries and the head of the local police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current MP and until then mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources approached by Cadena SER television, may have been the "head" of the entire enterprise.
Police continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the construction commission, and no further arrests in the coming hours are ruled out.
In addition, a lawyer for Juan Morales, the prime suspect in the construction of the building, was charged earlier this week.
As Caden SER was informed yesterday, a 'humanitarian' lawyer, MP Juan Morales, who was being investigated, was arrested on leaving Morales's residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to investigative sources, Morales is under investigation for allegedly collecting commissions for his signing a construction agreement with a Galician construction firm that reclassified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted an offer to lead the Toledo PSOE candidate and, if they win, to preside over Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and General Secretary of the Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to head the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo at the next general election and, if the Socialists win the general election, became President of Congress.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE’s secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself, following a meeting with Zapatero that took place at the party’s federal headquarters at noon today.
The head of the executive branch justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" this La Mancha politician will be the Socialist Party's candidate for President of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who on November 15 published his decision not to run in the next general election and to abandon his active political career in order to devote himself to the fight against climate change within university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister was constantly urging him to return to top politics, which he abandoned two years ago.
He went on to say that just as citizens know who will be the deputy economy minister if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who would preside over Congress.
If Bono takes office, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect and not of swearing or shouting" and make it "more and more like a citizen".
"Unfortunately, it sometimes seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't speak in peace and quiet is in Congress, the Prime Minister of the Senate was interrupted 26 times on one occasion."
He also spoke praises for the current president, Manuel Marín, and "his good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place, so as not to stoop to what his opponents might consider "greatness".
Climate Propaganda
As the climate-change movement subjects ruthless persecution both to those who view its predictions skeptically and to those who prefer other political and social struggles, it must show solid cohesion.
Moreover, to have a leader of the movement who is prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why his government's actions or inaction have contributed significantly to Spain leading the European Union in its failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this default, in which sectors it is happening, and why his government, the treaty government, did not prevent it.
In addition, it forces him to explain as clearly as possible to Spaniards what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be harmed by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, which energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept, and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But we have not seen such explanations, nor will we see them.
This is because we have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient, and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one centi centi of the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed to Zapatero so risky in terms of elections that he hastened to dismiss it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet so that it does not cost anything, pure propaganda, slogans devoid of any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And by covenants with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, does not accuse, does not demand anything, but is an adornment of meetings and arouses tenderness.
If it is limited to just being a virtual contracting party and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool ourselves with a fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totana arrested on suspicion of corruption during construction
According to investigators, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murciy town of Totano, José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a businessman in the hospitality industry, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and taken to the town hall, in whose premises he is now located, together with a number of police officers who also attended the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Lands and Apartments.
The three arrests coincided with six last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation linked to the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of farmland into suitable land for development so that the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term, could build 4,000 houses there.
In addition, two others have not been arrested, but are charged in an accelerated trial in the first instance court of the city of Totana.
The first six arrests were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totana and now a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, are under investigation.
His ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, was also charged, as was his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Niger (province of Pontevedra) and Pablo José M. G., director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company, which is part of that group and through which bribes were handed over.
The investigation is being carried out by a crime group in the construction of an operational central unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrests, also carried out eleven searches, mostly in companies related to the arrests, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (province of Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, in the area of a well-known owner of a poultry products company that could serve as a mediator.
The Nuaria Group was tasked with building the largest residential complex of the Murciy town of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project was to double the settlement of the village, which has a population of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which support the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking on the streets of Corunia, Venezuela, and Fernando el Católico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on direct marketing, and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this commentary from yesterday’s edition of Finland’s most important newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on November 18, the same day that Blackburn’s book criticism also happened to appear there:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in the city of Jokela.
The killer of the victims, a high school student, quoted works by Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, the education councilor responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded in the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that professors take a critical stand on Plato, arguing that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in a compulsory elementary philosophy course in secondary schools."

One colleague reports on the introduction of the crime of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a felony with rates ranging from six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal boards in the store with a price of less than 400 euros, it is considered a mere offense (Section 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in a store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (Section 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than an exchange of compacts.
To participate in the riot has a rate of three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be a rate of six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading a movie on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is more punishable than providing pornographic material to minors (Section 186).
So if my colleague's right, someone's got their hand out, and they're doing it right.

My attending physician shoves me with one of his articles on weird research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
The feelings caused by the monthly salary of employees depend on how much their colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomograph, and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The greatest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his colleague incorrectly.”
The researchers observed that if both succeeded, they received the same salary, activation was moderate, but when one received a double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Applicants from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecutor’s office in The Hague.
Her term expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings as the main culprits in the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which the documentary film "Karlin list" by Swiss director Marcel Schoepbach (2006, not known in Spain), which follows the work of a Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York, at the pace of a detective thriller, in the pursuit of fugitive criminals and pressure on the respective states to pull the net.
Which insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident, represents a significant expense, which depends on various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This liability takes the form of an insurance contract, which provides that the insurance company receives an agreed insurance sum of a certain amount for taking charge of the payment of damages in the event of an insured event.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors, such as age, status, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, the type of vehicle being insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the more likely an accident is to occur, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, based on checks, insurance companies have concluded that married people have fewer crashes than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of trips and thus the likelihood of having an accident.
Increasing the frequency of trips increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the premium price.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the insurance that best fits his profile as an insured person.
We will show here the most important variables for choosing this or that type of insurance, which, in addition to meeting the type of insured, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five face various disadvantages such as low driving experience and short possession of a driver’s license when they want to take out premiums at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discount of premiums so that they get insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume the client’s participation in the settlement of the insured event.
"The part of the claim settlement provided by the client will be pre-determined when determining the premium price, which will be the higher the lower the deductible," explains Luis Noguera, Head of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other traffic participants so that the client insures against damages caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance premiums in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that an insurance company has.
Malus, on the other hand, is the increase in the above-mentioned base rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus,” explains Noguera.
After crossing the threshold of twenty-five years, drivers have it easier when they go to take out insurance, as their client risk index decreases, thanks to their experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to take out insurance against all risks at a discount.
“Young people are usually unable to take advantage of the experience they have gained in the event of an accident, and even in driving,” the director of a European company in Spain said, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the “newcomer’s fear” has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not have children yet, it is better to take out insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows it.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to have the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks at a premium discount (which could amount to 300 euros) or at a high bonus, the insurance extended to other traffic participants, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
“Their proceedings are calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount,” Luis Noguera points out.
Pensioners are recommended insurance against all risks with a discount on insurance (which is 150 euros) or insurance extended to other participants of the operation, if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of a crash, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a good reason to study the insurance options that would suit us best given our personal situation.
Celtic are trying to score a point on AC Milan, which means the eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will match their strength this Tuesday at San Siro Stadium in an effort to get the point they lack to reach their respective goals at the close of the Champions League, as for the Italians it would mean being the first and for the Scots it would decide the placement.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured a promotion in the fifth match by a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but they need one more to make sure that they do not get ahead of the Shakhter with six points, who will play Benfica, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round ends, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will play for the first time on the 13th in the semi-finals, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed earlier than the others, and a tie at Giuseppe Meazza seems most likely, although both teams will try to compete for the win, because the Italians will not want to tacticalise at home and Celtic knows that after the win he would be first and would secure a better place in the semifinals.
Even a loss to Gordon Strachan could be enough to advance if the Shaker doesn’t win, but he can’t rely on that, because the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow (2:1) last week but won in the first straight match (2-0) will advance with the same number of nine points.
Thus, AC Milan players will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who believe they will make it to the semi-finals of the reorganized Champions League for the second time, just as they beat them in the same match in the last competition with a Kaka goal in overtime (1:0) after a 0-0 score in the regular time.
The hope that the "rossoners" will win will be Shakhtar, for whom it is worth winning, if only Celtic would lose, both for advancing to the eighth round and for remaining in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being the last one and not being able to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with one win, so she would play in UEFA.
The Spice Girls’ first concert was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators since breaking up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they opened their gig at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver said their group's reunion was "great".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which included a video recounting the band's history, which sparked a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tours take place at the same time as the release of EMI's new album in Spain, which features a selection of their main successful tracks, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage adorned with bracelets given to them by the husband of "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, despite a nervous Victoria forbidding him to do so a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham stated of the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he'll think of the show".
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also showed her nervousness during a meeting with journalists two hours before the show began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that world opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the reunion of the group, which she herself dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time "things have settled down and we all love each other very much".
However, a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
In the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with Virgin Airlines.
On arrival at the airport was waiting for the army nannies.
Five have a total of seven children.
After the show in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He will perform in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns over new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A dispute is underway between Russia and Ukraine over natural gas prices, increasing the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is channelled through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises Ukraine’s gas prices, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two reduced supplies to EU countries last year.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia’s state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, try to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more, as it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused an overwhelming drop in exports to Western Europe, which sharply raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of all gas supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of them remain underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom is replenishing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS 'must control foreign staff'
The inspector said that the Scottish NHS Chamber must improve criminal records checks on non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the Glasgow airport attacks in June.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate idea of the amount of foreign staff it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key checks were in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The president of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in staff from outside the European Economic Area immediately after the attacks on Glasgow Airport in June.
Bilal Abdullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of links to attempted bombings in the UK.
NHS chambers are expected to check foreign staff in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for work in the UK prior to his employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland for criminal background checks, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the commissions should be guided by the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we found that part of the personnel records contained evidence of these controls, they are not being conducted regularly," the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS is in much agreement with its own pre-employment screening policy, but also added, "Our report highlights areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information on the amount of foreign personnel is available."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that current pre-employment checks at the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what additional value those comments will bring," he said.
Scottish health authorities have said they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers will probably be higher also because the commissions had trouble identifying personnel with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the control procedures in place with the NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits, and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising the policy and guidelines for pre-employment checks for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said, "I wanted to finish this job immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish government, in agreement with health committees, will consider the report's recommendations and ensure that best practices appear in the updated pre-employment screening guidelines for all staff - including foreign staff - that it plans to release next month.
Joy Division wins film awards
Control, a biographical film about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, collected five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the award for best film.
The awards also went to star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and co-star Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller The Scandal Notes.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won a Variety Award for bringing British film to the world stage.
The awards were presented at the Roundhouse in London.
Control describes Curtis's journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film - whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie, and New Order - cost just 3 million pounds.
But it won Dutch photographer Corbijn, previously known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, two prizes - for Best Director and Best Debut Director.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner - as Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won the Best Actor award for his role as the driver of the Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg's London thriller Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, won the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the next Indiana Jones film, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of this award, which is named after the star of the Camelot and Harry Potter Harris films, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door for people like me."
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film awards, known as Bifs, are awarded by a jury consisting of filmmakers, actors, and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal, and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people over terror plot
Saudi Arabia said yesterday it had arrested 208 militants because of their membership in cells preparing for an imminent attack on an oil facility as well as clerical and security forces.
State-run state television said one of the cells wanted to smuggle rockets into the country.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have campaigned against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants, led by a foreigner, had planned to attack an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid response unit to defend the facility from a failed al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report cited an internal ministry statement: 18 of those arrested were from a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who slipped into the country.
She said the militants planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
The 22 detainees were to prepare the killings of clerics and security personnel.
The government has urged clerics to do more to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting with Allied troops and the US-backed Shia government, which conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militants - backed by calls from al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by security forces over the past... five months," an internal ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested to promote "Takfirian thinking" - an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
Venus’ climate may be a glimpse into the future of Earth
Scientists reported yesterday that Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live.
Data from an orbiting European station show that the planet is even more similar to Earth's willful twin than previously thought.
Venus is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit in similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago Venus had conditions similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the runaway greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and lower rotational speed have sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today the planet is without water, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is ravaged by storms and hurricane-force winds.
The findings from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which studied the planet for one year, offer a sobering look at how Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the University of Oxford's Department of Physics and one of the heads of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began as did Earth, possibly with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police arrest ‘enriched uranium’
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was seized by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people were detained and the material is being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million.
Always wide open
Mitt Romney said it was not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters uploaded their questions to a video and relayed them to the candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28, were as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other side's YouTube debate.
But questions and answers this time reflected much about the state of the Republican Party heading for elections next year.
It is not clear exactly how the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose the clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This is one of the most important Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something gratifying: the announcer noted peaks of approval when candidates talked about a hard border approach.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who poked his way forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of being soft on illegal immigrants as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
The two wrestled particularly fiercely when interviewers asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (giving illegal immigrants normal status and citizenship).
Side candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to throw their bit into the mill on the subject.
None of the two have a chance to be nominated, but both remain in the game, perhaps because they started to sound the alarm about immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, candidates have roughly the same view: more strictness at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, coupled with fears of toxic toys from China and other concerns with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very uncomfortable when it came to other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the technique of simulated heating should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Through this, Mr. Giuliani stumbled to the conclusion that although the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another inquirer asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who now stands out against all odds in a recent Iowa poll due to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, making him laugh.
The fight remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with recent fundraising successes and Ron Paul's loud cheers at Wednesday's debate.
The two bounced back, as both wings of the party still cannot agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with the victorious message of American greatness on his lips, winking at both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Labour's Pain
Gordon Brown once again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary in British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
No orders appear to have been sold, no bills in the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been sucked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would do without it being discovered that some wealthy businessman for four years had masked the party's ruling Labour party's contributions in the amount of 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million) under other people's names, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election and insulted the British intelligentsia by claiming that the decision was not influenced by the polls, there was hope of securing a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly witty deputy chairman of the Liberal Democrats put it, the once-feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of the troubled Northern Rock bank showed weaknesses in management and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has exposed unimaginable administrative mismanagement.
The three retired generals started a rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending, claiming that being a commander in the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many-edged gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s secretary general (and their former internal discipline watchdog), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably heading towards his end.
Despite this, governments can reach a tipping point beyond which they find governance difficult.
The people don't trust politicians and don't like them, but they usually put aside their mistrust when a new gang takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and does not even have to be in office for a long time, this postponement is gone: the state administration is becoming leaky, ministers are starting to make briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one way, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, as he cannot take the position of a new broomstick compared to other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the tax office are related to the decisions that Mr. Brown made as Secretary of the Treasury.
And although he was not directly involved in Blair's troubles, such as a long investigation into the funding of political parties caused by "ranks for money," voters may well conclude that he was.
Yet Mr. Brown's troubles are not as bad as they seem.
These missteps are not as gruesome as conservatives make them.
As far as Mr Bean is concerned, no one has died or been outright deceived.
And the cure, painful as it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid, and slightly brutal government.
The latest uproar over political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity, says he did not wish any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but it was not his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of big political donors are clear, and they exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who could buy access to those who govern the country.
Mr Watt, who said he knew of Mr Abrahams' advance but did not know that it was illegal, will certainly be thoroughly interrogated; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labour money-gatherer who learned of the tricky donations in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these schemes, even though the bulk of the payments were made after his arrival in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly denounced this violation of the law by his own party, but diluted his resolve by reaching for a well-tried instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - moreover, led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as find a permanent chair of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had none for six months, and proceed with a real reform of the funding of political parties.
This would require Labour, who are in dire straits, to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a devoted party man like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a solid lead in the polls; he has two years to win back the voters; and the only way to win is unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the subprime mortgage crisis affect the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, the dorsal fins naturally start to flutter around excitedly.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is shrinking, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if other consumer loan options become infected with subprime mortgages.
Signs of tension are evident.
There is an increasing number of defaults (with a delay of more than 30 days) and debited accounts (accounts considered unenforceable by the provider).
HSBC said last month it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market, also due to insolvent credit card loans.
It is still too early to panic.
Depreciated accounts and inability to pay are still few.
According to Moody’s, the 3.89 percent default rate in the third quarter was almost a full percentage point below average.
Deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
A change in the 2005 U.S. Personal Bankruptcy Act led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies that make up a large proportion of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore rise regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers have deteriorated.
The industry also shows a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts each month.
And confidence in secured credit card securities is solid, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the research firm TowerGroup predicts that their 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct ways to spread infection between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market: when property loans dry up, consumers are more likely to go into debt through credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, look at cash flow rather than the values of collateral items, so falling home prices don’t necessarily mean a change in borrowers’ credibility.
They can even be beneficial to lenders.
The incentive for consumers to repay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards moves up on the list of priorities for repayment.
Card issuers can also respond more quickly and flexibly to more tumultuous conditions than mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risks of a rapid change in the prices of collateral items.
“It’s not like we’re going to rethink all of our loans one fine morning,” said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
Although the risk of a subprime-style explosion is low, the risk of a gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron case
The three British bankers, who were to be tried for their roles in the fraud linked to Enron's former finance chief Andrew Fastow, changed their story Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew were initially charged with seven counts of fraud when they and Fastow were supposed to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- enriching themselves at the expense of their employers -- they denied.
They were due to appear in court in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each confessed to one fraud.
The case of the three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been featured on the front pages for the entire two years of the extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of an investigation launched after the 2001 Enron crash.
The charges brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he had been the target of a government investigation into the Enron crash.
The lawsuit against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot fraud along with Fastow and his former chief aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron’s Fastow-controlled affiliate, which was the architect of a series of Enron scams that pushed Enron spiralling toward bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its stake in this branch zero, but our three Britons knew that it was actually of considerable value.
The company, under Kopper's control, bought the bank's stake in this branch for $1 million.
The incriminated bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in Greenwich NatWest.
But the $20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers were charged with $7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others were charged with $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a Texarkana facility.
All three Britons were released on $1 million bail, which ordered them to stay in the United States for an upcoming trial.
Enron, once the country’s seventh-largest company, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks made it impossible to hide billions in debt or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion of market value, and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company's downfall.
Skilling is serving more than 24 years in prison.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were dropped after he died of heart disease last year.
The Moscow Non-Powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel for a nonstop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is a small return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in so many jobs because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires' Show, which is a four-day orgy of flamboyant consumption in a mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers have built their stalls, hoping to lure freshly-made Russians into everything from mahogany-inlaid yachts to diamond-decorated car counters that 50 Cent wouldn’t be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the next stall.
"That's a nice car, but it's pennies and dimes against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets."
On the waves of oil, money is pouring into the Russian capital just as it did when Dallas had its days.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans got tremendously rich and went to Europe where they were viewed as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi spenders of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part in this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a luxury industry conference attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford, and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like Russia’s.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes’ list of richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a combined net worth of $282 billion.
In addition, the Center for Economic and Financial Research published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "second-rate" millionaires in Russia, whose assets total $ 670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jewelry store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are well-groomed and men are worth a fortune."
As they walked through the halls in their evening dresses on Sunday evening, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and five-year-old Svetlana Turovcova called themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I've been looking at these cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who was dressing up in designer clothing as a red carpet veteran, with Joan Rivers looking like a housemaid next to her.
The fair seemed to be mainly focused on fresh rich people, brand-managed Russian shoppers who are willing to sit in the road for a few hours so that they can walk around the warehouse, which shrillly mix Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, ice cream Mävenpick, custom-made pool tables, apartments in Dubai, plushies Gund and avan.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's painting from a hand-painted blue tile in life-size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in tinsel."
Indeed, local sellers say that the Russians with old money (by Russian standards it is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from flashy logos to little-known limited edition brands that would never show up at a shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaire ambassadors or ordinary tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
Some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said he had sold two mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, interspersed with gold threads, for $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company had sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, which modifies luxury cars on request, said he had sold three car grilles in the style of connected chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a wheel of a car designed for a Russian casino owner that had a string coated with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for four of those.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife from cubic zirconium doesn't have to ride those wheels yet," Mr Karapetian said.
"She puts them in her garage of thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean much of an exclusive at the moment, given the large increase in the prices of local properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company has erected four red British-style payphones stuffed with a column of fake notes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaires' Fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw a lot of money around, or let their friends take a picture of them with their mobile phone, resting in the middle of a spare fortune, or simply stuffing a few million in their pocket.
"You know, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr Karryev said.
New Jersey death possibly caused by botched surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out the big windows of the local restaurant and watched the ambulance come to the white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car soon joined in.
And then another.
"Then I saw the medical examiner's van arrive," said Mr Livingston, a restaurant inspector.
“At that moment, I knew someone had died.”
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and they hope that toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help resolve the mysterious death that sent a wave of grief through New York City police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious and worked hard," Mr McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy stated that Miss Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney, Theodora J. Romankowa, said detectives are trying to determine if Ms. Arroyo died as a result of unlicensed surgical surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"Investigation is ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at around 3:00 p.m.
They found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, authorities still say little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh did not say if the authorities had questioned Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as a practice.
On Wednesday at Miss Castro's house, with a damaged rose bush in the front garden and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered
Next to the door that led to the basement, a blue barrel was enthroned in the open garage with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain bikes on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York City after 25 years in the New York City Police Department, Miss Arroyo gave him invaluable help in getting through the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should watch out for this or that,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will lower interest rates leads to the strengthening of world stock exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm borrowing conditions by further lowering interest rates were boosted by reassuring statements by the US Central Bank’s vice-chairman.
The stock exchanges jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line behind Ben Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, said that in responding to the ongoing pressure on financial markets, executives must be "flexible and pragmatic".
As part of an apparent effort to calm irritable markets amid signs of a resurgent credit crunch, Mr Kohn said that recent upheavals had "partially reversed some of the improvements in the functioning of the markets towards the end of September and in October".
He also said that if the increased instability persists, the possibility of financial conditions for households and businesses will increase further.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver more fresh bursts of capital to U.S. markets, and possibly lower interest rates to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid other bad news about the U.S. economy, with home sales at record lows in October.
The consequences of financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of a cost cut to compensate for the heavy losses caused by the failed bet on sub-prime housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to be eliminated in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index grew by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, with the value of the UK blue-chips rising by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index rose 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 grew 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets showed their full strength after the European Central Bank’s three-month money package auctioned these funds to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB into extra money on London’s money markets has increased, with rates on three-month UK interbank loans “Libor” rising to their maximum since the end of September after uninterrupted growth from 12 November - 6.59 percent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to be number six for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make that decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the selection committee, who holds this position at best on borrowed time, has Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, captain, making the decision to help, and because the table of Hugh Morris, head manager of the English team, begins to fill up with applications for the position of national selector, if not necessarily full-time.
Whoever doesn’t take sixth place will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It is not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets past the lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket that the choice is demanding and requires a review, which in the end always has to be subjective.
Is this the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is that fair to Shah, if so?
We could ask the same question in another area, say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with a good education and insight in the field, should be promoted to the committee - the place is only for one.
Who's to say which level is right for a cricketer if he doesn't get a chance to drop or swim to the next one?
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
In a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right moment if he is to take a wicket, and a batsman needs regular chances in starting positions if he is ever to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the view of the collector is more complicated.
For example, last season there were a lot of better James Andersons, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched like an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 wickets in the first grade at 33 runs for each.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 at the same meager average, but both had their moments at the highest level and are hoping for another.
Whether he plays at Asgiriya Shah or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice may start or finish the career of both, or it may not have much effect either.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and in the first class he gave good performances, five wickets and 40 allowed runs, but it was Paul Collingwood who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer who is extra despite having scored twice a hundred points in Australia, perhaps still underrated.
Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores are more likely to follow their conservative instincts after one further discussion following today's training entirely at Asirgiya Stadium, preferring Shah's greater experience to Bopar's youthful exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test innings speak at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in first class against six Boparov, who is, at twenty-two, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
However, Shah made only ten runs in two innings in May against the Caribbean at the Test at Lord's, his home ground in Middlesex, and that, along with an immediate rejection by the selectors, when Vaughan wanted to recast him for the next match, his batting seems to have taken away something of the vigor that was so evident in Mumbai.
In contrast, the Essex universal has a joie de vivre in its bones.
Nothing scares him on the cricket field, and his off-field behavior is symbolized by a recently overturned four-wheel-drive car at the exhibition day of the English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He got away with minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he pulled out was his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who watched it from a distance, to excitedly ask him, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, giving away his medium-fast skidding pitches on local courses that seem to suit him, effectively and batting confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of choice.
Personally, I’m leaning towards Bopara getting his chance now, which is not to say that Shah won’t excel if, as Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he’s the one playing next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, emptying out refugees who had run out of money or expired visas, and others hoping the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the militants who had driven them from their homes.
Mansour bus station was already there before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy about a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by private transport.
"I have decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor, said.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant cleric Muktada al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Qassem al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni Amariya region, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariya called him, saying that the local militia, with the support of the U.S. military, had helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the western capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newly arrived from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that was driven from his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, by a grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“The day before yesterday, several friends called me and told me that they were running a militia in Sleikh against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi said.
Many spoke of the attraction of pacification in the capital after the strengthening of the U.S. military presence and the growth of local "groups of biased citizens" who are arming alongside the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But more was said to have been driven back by visa obstructions and money loss in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced suspicions shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas to force them to return.
According to the available data, more than two and a half million people have fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis so they would have to go back to Iraq," said a Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house down after I left".
Part of the reason for attenuating the violence is that Sunnis have been pushed out of Shia areas and vice versa, reducing tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Tiny Saarland, good education
Germany’s smallest state plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even in the international focus of its universities.
In only one area of education is Saarland concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"To a person who is not from Saarland, I explained yesterday for the fiftieth time that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest state.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar education system, which ranks fifth in the monitoring of education at the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbruecken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a reasonably high proportion of international students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Saar children are admitted to college - many of them without attending high school.
"The professional education system is being used in Saarland", says Axel Plennecke, an educational expert at IW.
With more than one in five young people eligible to study at a vocational school, the Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are plenty of opportunities to combine practical and academic education in Saarland.
The opportunities to study two majors are second best in Germany in terms of population.
Despite practice-oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saar Education Ministry has now ordered universities to create a promotion campaign for engineering majors.
"After the first study of Pisa, we have made several reforms in the general education schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that is also taken over by other federal states.
If students’ performance improves significantly, future comparative studies will show.
When the Pisa study was carried out in 2003, the proportion of high-risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20%.
Overall, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
Beavers are better at counting.
And to the disappointment of the Saar Studies of Pisa, they do not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise Saarland could score points in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in grammar schools - even if the inhabitants of the Saar are not French.
Chávez moves the clock
The hours in Venezuela will be different than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will move the clock back half an hour in this South American country.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figurehead.
The official newspaper of Venezuela reported that under the new law, the clock will move by minus four and a half hours compared to world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chavez, an enemy of the U.S., justified his decision, among other things, by imposing whole-hour divisions of time zones on the world.
On Wednesday, Chavez said he was severing ties with neighboring Colombia over the hostage case.
This left-wing nationalist has stated that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can't because of my self-respect any more," said Chavez, who is pushing for constitutional reform, which the citizens of this oil country must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The dispute was sparked by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's authorization to negotiate with the Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of the hostages.
Uribe's decision "spit in the face" of Venezuela, he criticized on Sunday Uribe Chávez.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chavez.
The new mobile ringtone caused a stir: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet anymore?) - this is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
It was voiced by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who at a recent Ibero-American summit was so angered by the left-wing populist’s remarks that he silenced him in this way.
German workers face lower wages in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are at risk of reducing their real wages this year despite strong economic growth.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Bueckler Foundation, in 2007 employed people can realistically expect to receive a lower salary than last year.
"The blame lies with a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and a price increase for food and energy," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics und Konjunkturschung told Bild.
New burdens on workers may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbräck told the Neue Osnabrucker Zeitung that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
The Federal Employment Agency, however, would no longer be allowed to fall into such difficulties that it would have to demand loans or contributions from the Federal Youth.
On Tuesday, it was reported that a price explosion of food and oil products drove inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In the annual comparison, prices increased by 3%.
Venus is Earth's Hell Twin
Despite its life-threatening atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought. The European Venus Express spacecraft recorded phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is glowing.
Now the European Venus Express spacecraft has produced evidence of electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere, with lightning flying from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, according to Nature science magazine Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to the well-known theory of the origin of primordial matter, lightning may have created life on Earth. The storms are said to have triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
It wasn’t like that on Venus: “If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus; the atmosphere is about 100 times denser than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500 °C.
"Venus may be Earth's hell twin, but he's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in terms of mass and size, began to evolve in a completely different way, is a fundamental question of the Ace mission.
Since no spacecraft has been launched since the early 1990s for the sole purpose of studying Venus, the Venus Express launch in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of the planet.
According to scientists, the latest research, which has been published in several articles of the journal Nature, has not only emphasized the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They have also shown that our neighboring planet is more similar to Earth than previously thought," Esa said.
In addition to the already known winds at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that spins much faster.
This phenomenon resembles air currents in the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km is almost as large.
This planet, called Morning Star or Evening Star, orbits the Sun in almost 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly around its own axis, with one day on Venus lasting 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble Earth at a surface temperature of 460°C and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that the two planets formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both of them, but it remained in the oceans on Earth, while it evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Koehler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President Koehler has called for an end to partisan disputes over the Dalai Lama's acceptance into the chancellor's office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Koehler is concerned about Germany's reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We should not present ourselves externally as a nation that is not united on this issue," Koehler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed sympathy for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s (CDU) decision to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," he said.
While he stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not prevent him from standing up for Merkel when she was reproached for creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows that, too," said Koehler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his opposition to the Dalai Lama's admission, and was attacked from within the coalition because of it.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition's "demonstrative" foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government cancelled the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbräck (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL, it has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that accepting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China disapproves when European politicians officially accept a Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas that are also located in China, is trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar riots in France
Street battles with police, gunfights, burning cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not turn into violence on the streets, the German Interior Minister said.
Barricades were burning, rioters fired shotguns at police, and after serious riots among young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is worried about similar developments in Germany.
“We also need to be careful not to create social tensions that escalate into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the newspaper Neue Presse in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to fix the problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, we are seeing our first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In recent nights, youths have fought fierce street battles with police in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Cars and public buildings were also on fire in Toulouse.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
With regard to the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "imitation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25, who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "above average".
Above all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed, "We must give youth hope."
However, the head of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is more social control of families.
Moreover, many of the youths from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat admonished, "But we still have to be careful."
We must "quickly allow the youth to start working and educating themselves."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained largely peaceful.
Hundreds of police were deployed and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorized authorities have reported three arrests and several burning trash cans and cars.
As of yesterday, approximately 1,000 deployed law enforcement forces are taking care of the peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after the visit.
About 80 police officers were injured in riots in the Villiers-le-Bel suburb on Tuesday night.
The following night, riots took place in Toulouse.
Sunday's car accident left two teenagers dead.
According to the initial findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of juveniles.
In the realm of Angela "Cloud"
The Chancellor's remote output documents that the coalition is programmatically at an end and that we can expect nothing more from it.
What country does the Chancellor live in?
After her bleak, indifferent-sounding and content-poor speech at the general debate of the Bundestag, we must state: not here - not in this country, which, after all, she should manage.
To the reproach of focusing too much on foreign policy, Angela Merkel responded with one very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she didn't want to understand what the critics were up to.
In the Bundestag, she visibly demonstrated to everyone how much she deserved the reproach.
There was no real interest in Merkel, let alone a sense of the country’s problems.
Instead, Angela "Cloud" presented herself: a politician who stands out from the rest, who flees into foreign policy and even there expresses herself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it constantly praises the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but it no longer says how the climate targets should be achieved in Germany.
Such self-praise - such immodesty would have been forgiven by the CDU chair two years ago.
Now she confines herself to idle phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, she damages her image as a pragmatist who does not need flattery because she solves problems.
But in the realm of Angela "The Clouds" internal political problems are a peripheral matter.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage people?
There are a few minor issues on these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel is resented when it comes to child benefits.
Merkel has to start from the beginning three times in order to be able to say the right sentence at least in part.
As soon as things start to get too concrete, it stumbles like in a completely alien terrain.
Department of Attack
The debate over the Republican presidential candidates on YouTube has erupted into heated debate among Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney's favorites - and both must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident in the first issue.
Mitt Romney tosses it to rival Rudy Guiliani for making New York "a haven for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly reacts with sharp regrets: “I believe his own house was just one such refuge,” he replies, throwing to the former Massachusetts governor that he privately employed undocumented immigrants.
With the Republican base not yet having a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their rivals.
Half-minute videos recorded by Internet users and uploaded via YouTube serve only as such hints on a key topic.
"It is precisely this policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to seize power," John McCain told rival Ron Paul, who is the only one advocating for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain spares no regrets, not even Romney, for refusing to condemn the torturous method of interrogation called "Waterboarding", in which heating is simulated.
Audience reactions in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that neither the war in Iraq nor methods of torture are among the important topics of the campaign.
The audience breaks out in applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney lamented, asking the party's base and television audience to forgive him for having been a supporter of abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in civilian clothes for the first time
The day after his resignation as Commander-in-Chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf took the oath of office on Thursday and will remain in office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony, which took place in the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to honor the constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office as commander-in-chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, putting himself under international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules as a civilian head of state for the first time.
By resigning as commander-in-chief, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on November 3.
Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayyum said Musharraf would lift the state of emergency soon after his oath of office to meet Western demands.
The country’s highest court, which seized Musharraf after declaring a state of emergency in early November, rejected all objections to the disputed re-election of the head of state on October 6 last week.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Waziristan tribal area, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The krautrock fathers are back
The famous German band of the 1970s played again. Three members of the group Harmonia took up their electronic synthesizers again at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
At that time, they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation then lies in the appearance of three sedentary gentlemen, who initially look as if they are just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and buttons in front of them.
The 63-year-old Dieter Moebius is sitting in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
The 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who leans over the synthesizers, is on the right from the audience’s point of view.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by mistake, they create a traditional composition.
Musicians don’t seem to care much.
Among krautrock lovers, Harmonia's revival caused quite a stir.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not so well-versed that this band has been painfully lacking for twenty-three years.
But why shouldn’t even a German be able to celebrate his still-living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when he values the musical style, mistakenly called krautrock, more in England and America than in his own country.
When the music business awarded the surviving members of the Cologne band Can the Echo Award for their life’s work in 2003, the hall was full of questioning views of German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Duesseldorf and Neu! during their speech, the audience’s amazement no longer knew the limits.
Michael Rother later joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
Remembering the band Harmonia unnecessarily overloads the memory, this trio existed for only two years and even then it was far from having the effect that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they performed in the basement of the Berlin Schaubahne Theatre.
Then in Dusseldorf, for economic reasons, at a record label run by the church.
Rother briefly helped out with the band Kraftwerk, but only gained a reputation as a guitarist with the band Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of a commune who had fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to toil as a nanny.
It was more of a life in such a Spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for the art is said to be derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge is said to have been found in the trash can.
Much of this harmony is preserved.
The first album was titled "Music by Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Gathering the plants wasn't just for self-knowledge.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" is said to have been cut during a concert in Griessem in front of a record-low, barely 50-piece set.
At that time, Rothera expressed the wish that the members of Harmonia should work out and exercise occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebio, it was a totally rude request.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up in the esoteric realm and insured his future with the album "The Burning Heart".
The band Cluster came back to life in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia ever was.
For the live album from Griessemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grunemeyer.
His record label, Groenland, intended krautrock to be Germany's original contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered to be Roedelius' solo work at the time.
The physical resurrection of Harmony will take place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Performances at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
Present will be Brit, Julian Cope, an old punk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
Love Parade founder Dr. Motte will also be attending.
Thus, we have outlined the overall extent of the influence of krautrock on future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence, accompanied by the most bizarre sounds, floats in the hall: "Unique true music, she owns the future."
There are paintings in which the producer is in a peasant seat with Harmony.
The projection of other black-and-white photographs with wildly connected cables also contributes to the creation of the legend.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No more sticking microphones to organs and drums to get the never-before-heard, self-made tones out of the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the technique of immersing pedantry.
The House of World Cultures does not change that either.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place she sings emphatically "Aaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find roots rather than in the blues in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk), or in escaping from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts '68' in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia will not allow herself to be led astray even now.
Even the most obvious thing on the scene is carefully thought out.
Where does the music begin and when does it end?
This question will either rob a person of his nerves or allow him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With the release of the films The Hunting Party and Muerderischer Frieden, there were two films about the war in the Balkans.
But none of them are convincing.
The films either put too much emphasis on action and shooting, or are too moving.
Even an actor like Richard Gere can’t stop him at The Hunting Party.
Good news first: The war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the grim background of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Recently, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the eighties, not only because he has played many attractive, non-serious roles in relaxing women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences eternally on the topic of Buddhism, a person will take a taste for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the Hunter Gets His Booty (Why do movie titles have to be so long and tangled these days?).
His war reporter, Simon Hunt, is basically what Gere would have been if fate and the film industry hadn’t been so merciful: a man who has his best years behind him but still retains a remarkable charm as a ruin-like monument.
But, despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German film M rderischer Frieden, which is also coming to cinemas this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
We can do a short process with the film: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, whereupon one of them falls in love with her.
While it is commendable that Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television-shy film turns too soon into a shooting and action.
There will be something very similar from the movie Kobru 11, without the highway, but with the war.
The Hunting Party explores why the Balkan War has never been a good movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who go after a "fox", Serbia's top war criminal, could possibly become the new "Apocalypse" at another time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (here both are Richard Shepard).
Surprisingly, both stories are similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is not capable of doing, but their journey becomes a road to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauched and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the draft will also prescribe him a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
We can finally write off The Hunting Party after the reporters in the last five accelerated minutes of the film do what NATO, the CIA, and all the world’s criminal hunters have failed to do in the past five years: catch criminals and leave them for the righteous revenge of Bosnian Muslims.
This is so contrary to the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
This film has a deeply human message.
It denounces the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (who are exceptionally united here) that they are not pursuing persecution intensively enough under secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women can think of the famous Brecht poem.
There is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the swollen veins on his forehead, noting: how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party, there are just such swollen heads, but they indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the issue of war in the Balkans.
It was recently reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were major setbacks.
One thing to add: No good film has ever been made about South Africa.
It’s almost always true: When a star roams a crisis zone or walks a minefield, a movie like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Breaking Bad with Angelina Jolie, or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio is made.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it must have been decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust movie - Schindler's List.
Many films must have matured - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse" or "The Lead Vest" - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Writers don’t have the ability to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good, after all, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps he needs to form a sarcastic artistic perspective like novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lempriir's Dictionary" and the "Balkan War", he stated: "The resemblance lies only in the fact that some things never change.
Cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust has been criticized for canceling the Olympics.
The mayor’s resignation from the Hamburg Summer Olympics has come under fierce criticism from politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the arrangement of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, encourages realism in the estimation of chances.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jorg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called the decision "unfortunate from a business point of view".
No other project in the city has awakened as much motivation as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to sustain this sporting and political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which builds on the changed timetable."
The mayor of Hamburg, Ole von Beust, said on Wednesday that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Federation will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that in early December, the Sports Union will decide on Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means for us that we have no realistic chance of having a 2028 timetable."
“The dream is not over,” said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) called von Beust's comments regrettable.
Hamburg does not want to bid for the next 25 years.
"It's still too early to ruin our chances by marking plans buried at this early stage," HSB president Gunter Ploss said on Wednesday.
To renounce the application would be contrary to the testimony of the head of the Senate, which he gave at the General Meeting of the General German University Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce his candidacy for the 2015 Universiade as a replacement for hosting the Olympic Games.
Last week, the Hamburg University Sports Association nominated the city as a candidate.
The SPD faction in Hamburg's Senate parliament has accused it of wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered for years by the Senate's bet on hosting the Olympics and excluding the construction of apartments," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area was still planning the Olympics, with the entire area later to be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked a lot of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg was wrecked in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
He who combines the terms Sweden and wooden boxes does not think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes currently produced in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's list of works.
Most of his list of ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's 1968 "Brillo boxes", comes internal research of the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm with the result that brought disillusionment; six "Brillo boxes" donated to the Moderna Museet Museum in 1995 by its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - like most of the other "Brillo boxes" in the international market of the Stockholm type
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red-blue-white design of the Brillo soapboxes.
An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo cases in Sweden, but they are not on display in the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time now speak of fifteen crates that rightfully entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the designation Typ Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that about a hundred cases had been made and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then handed over to him.
In fact, 105 of Hultén's crates were only made in Malmo for the St. Petersburg exhibition in 1990.
Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Bystrom, Chief Conservator of Moderna Museet, examined in addition to the six Brillo boxes that are owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood boards had been painted base paint and sanded, they were painted oil white with a brush.
The structure of copies from 1990, on the other hand, showed that the paint was applied directly to the plywood board without the previous primer - in addition, it is acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box list," said Moderna Museet director, Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies."
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would look into the "core allegations" that had been made about soap-powder boxes.
However, the organization remains unrelentingly silent.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers surrendered, fortifying a hotel in Manila and demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Riot leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption during the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denies responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had earlier attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had fortified themselves in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were on trial for thwarting a 2003 coup attempt, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with about 30 of his sympathizers.
The military police officers who were supposed to be guarding him apparently defected to his side and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government's loyal troops have cordoned off the area around the selected hotel.
The president called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We encourage people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former Scout Rangers elite unit, said other military units would join the march in the short term.
Critics of the government called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Corruption has been blamed on the government for months.
Manila's financial district became the main staging area for the 2003 uprising of about 200 soldiers against Arroyo.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the revolt failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, the Philippines has tried at least seven times to overthrow a democratically elected government.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatelu
United Internet acquired a more than 20 percent stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05 percent of its share capital.
There has been speculation about a takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increase of its stake in Versatelu.
United Internet has announced that it is taking this step to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the network operator by another 5% to 15.1%, there were rumours of entry on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this monetary institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had almost a 10% stake in Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications network provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch has given a further 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros to be sold.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were bought for 31.4 million euros by United Internet.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the area of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman explained.
In order to take over the competing Freenet companies, the companies together set up an SME joint venture.
United Internet said Thursday that the two companies will settle for more than 10 percent in Freenet and will not use their right to take over another 18.49 percent of the business.
For the time being, it is considered that the companies keep all options open, in particular the possibility to further increase their stake in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet regarding the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This months-long and hard-to-transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million full or DSL customers at the end of the third quarter.
United Internet and Drillische held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will receive an additional 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the Vatas investment company was agreed as early as August.
