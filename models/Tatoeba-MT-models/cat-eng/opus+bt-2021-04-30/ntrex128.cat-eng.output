Members of the Welsh assembly worried that they would identify them as Muppets.
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title for MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, a member of the Welsh parliament).
This controversy has arisen at the root of the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become motive for ridicule.
A member of the Labour party's assembly has claimed that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP is using Twp or Pwp.
For readers who are not Welsh: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly commented that the party as a whole -- doesn't see it in good eyes -- and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh conservative member has claimed that his group was showing up -- in the face of the name change, but commented also that there is too small a difference between the term -- MWP -- and -- Muppet.
In this context, the letter –w – in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter – u – in Yorkshire English.
According to the assembly committee responsible for drawing up the legal draft to introduce the name changes: - The final decision on any qualifier to name the assembly members will of course lie in the members themselves -
The Welsh government's 2017 Act grants the Welsh Assembly all power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with extensive support for the proposal to change the assembly's name to the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of the assembly members, even though the committee stepped down from - Members of the Welsh parliament - or -WPM - the option of -MWP - is the one which received a wider support for public consultation.
Apparently, assembly members are suggesting different alternatives, however, the attempt to reach a consensus may mean a full mischief for the assembly's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the legal draft on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the operation of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of its members and design of the committee system.
Members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their denomination during the legislation-related debate.
The Macedonians will vote in referendum on changing their country's name
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name to the ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that has lasted decades with neighbouring country Greece, who already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted on the fact that its northern neighbor's name represents a way to reclaim its territory and has repeatedly opposed this country's attempts to be part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, contrary to the plebiscite on the name change, has claimed that he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favor, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Bells of St. Martin's Stop Ringing: the Difficulties of Harlem Churches
\"Historically, the elderly I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner -- Mr. Adams comments.
\"Today, there's none left, both of them--\"
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be come to be understood.
People have a different way of socializing today -- they say.
\"The bars have already ceased to be that kind of living rooms for the neighborhood where people periodically went.\"
Regarding churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as what his leaders foresee – and that sooner or later they will return to the place where they came from –
The churches, he adds, could eventually be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will be of no help to temples remaining in the neighborhood.
- The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white - claims, - and so what they will do will speed up the closure of all churches, since it is entirely unlikely that most people moving to these condominiums will eventually be members of these churches -
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation there originally left during the 1930s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, which led a boycott of retail merchants on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black-bred people.
In 1939, a fire caused severe damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, that was when they commissioned the laneway.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly described the laneway as the bells of poor people.
The expert who sounded the laneway in July described it differently: \"A cultural treasure\" and an unreplaceable historical instrument.
Expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the world's first laneway that was played by a black-bred musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who had to move to the Riverside Church's largest laneway 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded at St. Martin's for the past few months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July while expressing concern that the diocese, which was intending to transmit the costs, to the council, although the latter was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy while searching for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while doing a dive to search lobsters in California on the first day of the locust season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to explains Chad Hammel at KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy begging for help, and then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was about the joy of having taken a lobster, but then he noticed he was yelling 'I was bitten!
They bit me!'
He had the whole striped collarbone - he observed Hammel when he reached the boy.
'Because everyone came out of the water, I shouted, 'There's a shark in the water!' adds Hammel.
The boy was airborne to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted into serious condition.
It is not known what the species of shark responsible for the attack is.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that work a few weeks that a shark had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that that species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim was suffering from traumatic injuries in the upper area of the torso.
Authorities closed for 48 hours access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas due to investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans, towards the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's has decided to make competition to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty products corridors in the style of the large occupied stores with specialist employees.
These large corridors are only a part of a considerable investment in the market for beauty products in the UK, a market moving about 2800 million GBP and continuing to grow as long as the fashion and household products sectors stay behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year if the test becomes a success.
Investment in beauty products is the product of supermarket avidity to take advantage of space on their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's claims that it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3000 different products, first included brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of brands similar to those that can be found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also under relaunch of its range of Boutique make-up products in order for most products to now be suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two Sainsbury's stores. the first did so last week in Croydon, south London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and changing towards a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day at small supermarkets has made big supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, the stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since acquiring both chains two years ago, which, it comments, has served to relaunch grocery sales and increase profitability from acquisitions.
The supermarket chain's previous attempt to relaunch its beauty products and pharmacy departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's took a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but all ended hastily in disagreeing on how to split the pharmacies chain profits to within supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its 281 pharmacies business to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of leather product luxury brands, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, comments: \"We have transformed the look of our beauty products corridors in order to improve the environment in the face of our customers.
We have invested in trained workers specifically who will be of great help in offering counseling.
Our brand range is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the favorite destinations for beauty products and that we challenge the traditional way to shop --
Peter Jones - furious - after Holly Willoughby backed out of an 11 million GBP deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left – furious – after TV presenter Holly Willoughby backed out of an 11 million GBP deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to engage in the joint home product business and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
37-year-old This Morning host used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones enraged at retiring in the last minute of the lucrative joint lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts of his own with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will report great profits to him as well.
According to several sources, Jones was -- furious -- when the blonde TV star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at her empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the presenter's new agreements, worth 1.5 million GBP, implied that she would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of home products and Truly accessories.
The business had come to compare to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When 37-year-old Willoughby used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane toward one of his holiday residences outside the UK.
According to one source: 'Truly was by far Holly's main priority.
It was meant to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to step back left all parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of goods in its Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined it by taking over as chairman last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together. in addition, Jones owns 40 percent stakes in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will be the next brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity programme.
A source close to Jones commented last night that \"We won't make any comments about his business\"
Hard accusations... - and then we fell in love -
He joked about the potential criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider -- not a president's own -- and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump claimed, all mocking the tone of a news presenter's voice:
- I didn't give up anything -
He observed that Kim had an interest in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the summit held in June in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a correspondence response - by the US to the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
However, he observed, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump's view, on the other hand, was far more optimistic in his speech.
- We're doing very well with North Korea - he claimed.
- We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions would have lost their lives.
And now we maintain this great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: end of missile testing, help to free hostages and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relationships with Kim.
'It's easy to be a presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this precinct full of people, we'd have about 200 of them' said Trump, pointing to the crowd standing in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations from other countries were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster whatsoever was declared, a prerequisite to be able to catalyze international aid.
In many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is rather demanding.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not certain even if foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies are allowed to contribute when providing aid.
Given the constant seisms suffered by Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters have been built in the event of a tsunami, they are not frequent on other coasts.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, even if there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
To move between the huge amount of islands of Indonesia is, at best, quite a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is now heading towards Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as the central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's damaged infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railway tracks.
However, Joko's government is facing re-election year loaded with funding deficits.
Joko is also facing pressure from the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative edge faith.
Over 1000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced people are the result of the fighting taking place on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge makes the pitch goal with a far shot in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat in front of Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate when his team was losing 1 to 0.
He accommodated the ball to the left before dropping an incredible shot directed at the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great elevation as it propelled towards the right cross of the gate.
The ball finally started the downhill above a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
‘I was just trying to get to that position so I could shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward everything possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible.' Sturridge comments at LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kanté coming, I took a knock and I didn't think about it very much, I just dedicated myself to kicking.'
Chelsea won 1–0 on the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute via their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
On the play, the Blue team's lead returned from heel a pass to Mateo Kovacic before tearing from almost midfield and spiriting towards Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from midfield.
Next, he made a magnificent pass deep, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball controlled.
Hazard overcame the defence to finish at the second pole with a shot with his left leg where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker was unable to arrive.
Liverpool will face Naples at the group stage of the League of Champions next Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for their part, will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll reaches 832

Cromwell's statue of the British parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around--rewriting history--
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction to the Taliban's purest style of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as a – crazy - and an - attempt to rewrite history -
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: 'In the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps it would end up sacrificing the incorrect Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor he did during the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent portrayal by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of being commemorated.
Goldsmith told the The Sunday Telegraph: -Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than he is now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously of monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes an entirely accurate representation remains a subject of historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A killer pig wounds a Chinese farmer from death
One farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, as reported by local sources.
The man, identified solely by his last name - Yuan - was found dead with a carved artery and all covered in blood near a pig court in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported on Sunday on the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into the pigs in a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as is known, he had traveled Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The following morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that he gave to a court of contiguous pigs.
According to claims, in court there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg garri had wounded the farmer from death, according to the report.
- My cousin had his legs shattered and filled with blood - said the cousin, last name - Wu - as mentioned in Guiyang evening news.
Scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the property of either Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market managers commented on the evening news that the pig remained locked and isolated in order to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while police gathered the evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although very uncommon, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig nearly 300 kg took a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to frighten the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood may act as a – decaying one –
- They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious...they don't go with the idea of hurting.
Just give them the respect they deserve - he commented.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout the southwestern US
According to forecasters, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the colder waters on Mexico's northern coast.
However, the Rose will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern US over the next few days.
El Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, owning a category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. Sunday, eastern US time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rose is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is beginning to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving east towards the west coast of the US. when the Rose approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a heavy tropical humidity northward toward the southwest US.
El Rosa will leave Monday up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate generalized torrential rains throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous laughs, waste flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will lead to near-50 to 75 mm per hour rainfall rates at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility of riverside forming, since the situation is getting worse very quickly due to the scattered character of tropical rains.
It is totally discouraged to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause gorges to become uncontrolled rivers, and storms can carry flurries of wind and clouds of dust at specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains at certain points off the coast of southern California.
Total rainfall above 50 mm may be recorded, which could lead to minor waste flows and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
They will begin arriving insulated chaff of tropical rain in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday.
Torrential rains will spread out to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and persist throughout Wednesday.
October there will be several important temperature oscillations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can at times cause drastic temperature changes in a short distance.
The central region of the U.S. on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Nearly 20 degree temperature differences have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected to start in October with heat in much of the central and eastern area of the US, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern Plains area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, representing about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there is much chance that temperatures will be recorded above average in the eastern US during the first half of the month of October.
Over 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's statement
Over 20 million viewers watched Thursday the passionate testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The witness was broadcast to six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular Friday programming due to a turn of events at the last minute: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford explained to the senate Committee for judicial matters that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, over 20.4 million viewers are likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
Hearing figures were not immediately available for other chains that broadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN, or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems in calculating people who see it from his office.
Put in perspective, this is an audience similar to that of an American football playoffs game or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most audience-wise chain, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the one-day all-time testimony, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS achieved 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest remains high after witness.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, Flake was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was ingrained by protesters when he tried to step up to an elevator to go to a view of the Judiciary Issues Committee.
Flake stayed several minutes with his sight downed as he was taken up live on television on CNN.
'Here I am, in front of you,' said a woman.
- Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
They told him 'you have power, while there are so many women who don't have them.'
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he commented that he will have more to say in the view of the committee.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcast chains were already broadcasting live the moment the Judiciary Issues Committee had to vote on whether or not it followed with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary to submit it to vote.
Flake said, on the other hand, that he would only do so by understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee facing next week, a condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part thanks to the talks he held with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of \"playing politics\" in connection with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticised her plans to leave the European Union to play politics with the future of the United Kingdom and to disregard the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative party congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview in addition to the one conducted with May on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign affairs minister of May Boris Johnson strengthened his attack on the so-called Chequers for Brexit plan, where he states that the proposal that the UK and EU collect taxes mutually is – from all absurd –

A volcano spits out ash in Mexico City
The ash spit by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The national disaster prevention center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center was monitoring several tights and tremors that had recently occurred.
Images on social media where you appreciate a thin layer of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in volcano activity located 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as -Don Goyo - has remained active since 1994.
Police are dealing with Catalan separatists shortly before the referendum anniversary on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favour of independence confronted riot police and thousands of people joined opposing demonstrations to recall the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia over their secession.
A group of independent individuals held by riot police began throwing eggs and powdered paint at them, resulting in the appearance of dark clouds of dust in the streets usually invaded by tourists.
Later the same day, bouts occurred with police, who used their hogs in order to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups chanted, \"We don't forget, we don't forgive -- face-to-face with unionist protesters calling out -- Long live Spain\"
Fourteen people had to be cared for by slight injuries suffered during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not declined in this independence-minded region a year after a referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but equally carried out by Catalan separatists was held on October 1.
Voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the participation index was low, since those opposed to secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting entering polling stations across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
Independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a national police support demonstration.
The demonstration took place anyway, but protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration along with his wife, said that he no longer had much hope about the chances of Catalonia attaining independence.
- Last year we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy at the fact that I could vote, but now we're stuck -- he commented.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although by little margin, in autonomic elections last December, Catalan independence parties have suffered to maintain the push this year, since many of their main leaders are in a self-imposed exile or detainees waiting to be tried for their role in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, tapes the police support demonstration with his phone, and claims that the conflict has invigorated him from politicians on both sides.
Tension doesn't make it any more than increasing -- he comments.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed before the trial since late last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
\"Presenting as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the backlog in democratic values and repression that we have seen by the Spanish government\" it claims.
Londonderry: Men arrested after they invested a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly invested against a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says door damage and the same building were caused.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone has shot a crossbow at the car.
A Menga play gives Livingston the 1–0 victory in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston resulted in the victory
Livingston, who had this year stepped up, surprised Glasgow Rangers in what is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox neighbourhood club.
Dolly Menga's play made a difference, as, with this win, Gary Holt's team climb to the second position, which they share with Hibernian.
Gerrard's, on the other hand, continue to be winless outside the Premiership this season. next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they separate an eight-point difference.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Vienna Rapid in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend to six games his unbeaten streak in the league, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what the defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston doesn't take his chances in front of the direct game of visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead at the score long before the goal, as their direct game caused all kinds of problems at Rangers.
Scott Robinson paved his way between the defence, but he was wasted his occasion when he found himself in front of the gate. then, Alan Lithgow sent the ball out on stretch to try to finish Craig Halkett's head pass, which crossed the gate.
The locals were already well off letting Rangers approach their area, as they knew they could get visitors into trouble on isolated plays.
And that's how this decisive goal came about.
The referee whistled a fault against Rangers interests and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so Menga could play it first and finish from the central part of the area.
Up to that point, Rangers had dominated possession, but met with impenetrable defence and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had quite little work throughout the match,
The stage was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop of merit.
For his part, Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped with his feet one occasion from Scott Pittman and Lithgow finished deflecting another Livingston combination play.
Rangers engaged in hanging over and other balls in the Livingston area, only to be rejected, plus two penalties were claimed, one for an alleged entry by Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for hands, both of which were dismissed.
Livingston -phenomenal -: analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man feels that they were excellent, and keep exceeding all expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top grade, although much of the merit must be attributed to Holt for the way that he has galvanised the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, at the head of a perfectly organized defence, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be pending Menga throughout the match.
Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite bright moments displayed with Gerrard as coach, they definitely haven't known how to keep the level.
They did not know how to create occasions (only once they clearly overcame local defence), and this Rangers, who are at the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Aggressive reception for Erdogan in Cologne
They were all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to matters such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
And it's just that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25 000 from congregating in front of the mosque, while a lot of followers gathered around it so they could see their president.
Hundreds of counter protesters in Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard while condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and called dictator by others.
Deptford Traffic Accident: One cyclist dies encountering a car
One cyclist has been killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident has taken place near the junction of Bestwood Streets and Evelyn Street, an area with strong Deptford traffic, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedic services cared for the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist died in a escape hit case on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan police have said their officers are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest relatives.
The street has been cut off and deviations have been applied for bus routes; drivers have been advised to avoid the area.

Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with major laughs (the drought areas might prove benefited)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that is precisely what is likely to happen early next week when what remains of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, with the consequent risk of riversides.
National weather service has already issued alerts for rivers for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Rosa is expected to reach Phoenix directly on Tuesday and to approach it on Monday night with rains.
Phoenix's national weather service commented in a tweet that only – ten tropical cyclones have maintained storm status or tropical depression within a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed 64 km from Arizona border -
The most recent models of the national hurricane center forecast 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas in the southwestern desert, including the central Rockies and Great Conca, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For out-of-risk areas of brooks, the Rose rain could become very good news, since the region is suffering from a severe drought.
Despite the fact that the rivers are a serious reason for concern, some of the rainfall could prove very beneficial, as the southwestern region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the US drought control service, over 40 percent of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reportsweather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will touch land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
El Rosa continued to have hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which causes it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force on the afternoon or Monday evening.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with considerable risk of laughs.
According toweather.com, they are expected from 75 to 150 mm total rain from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility that they will reach up to 250 mm --
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning with tropical depression strength, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach southern Utah well into Tuesday night.
The main risk we expect from the Rose or what's left of it is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern US desert -- according to the national hurricane center.
Rains are predicted to cause dangerous riverine and waste flow to deserts, plus landslides in mountainous areas.

Trump says that Kavanaugh -- has suffered the meanness and anger -- from the Democratic party
– The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for rejection of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic party – decreed Trump in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has -- pacited the meanness and anger -- of the Democratic party throughout its naming process.
Kavanaugh stated before Congress Thursday, bluntly and emotively denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of having sexually abused her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also stated on view in relation to his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's greatness, human quality, and bravery.
“The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable course of citizenship service, ” he commented to the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as he talked about the importance of the Republican voter participation index in the midterm elections.
- We're five weeks away from one of the biggest elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but actually I am going there - he said.
- That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our big candidates -
Trump argued that Democrats are engaging in - resisting and obstructing -
The first key procedural vote to be held in the senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place as very late Friday, as reported to CNN an assistant to Republican party leaders.
Hundreds killed by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by giant waves crashing against the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities claimed Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered Friday for a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast into dusk, dragging many of the people to death and tearing everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and they didn't run right away, so they became victims -- said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a statement in Jakarta.
\"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, smashed all that was on the ground\" said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting on the coast.
There are people who climbed atop a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he comments.
Some 16 700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where the amount of shattered shops and buildings are appreciated, bridges turned over and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake this coastal city Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's technology assessment and enforcement agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the atomic bomb power dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical features of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have increased the magnitude of the tsunami exponentially.
Nugroho described the damage as - considerable - and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he remarks, were found trapped among the rubble of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 stray.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicentre.
Communications -- they were completely paralyzed, so no information came -- from Donggala, Nugroho says.
There more than 300 000 people live there - commented on the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their workers and volunteers were heading for the affected areas.
\"It's a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse--opine.
The agency was heavily criticized Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although agents said the waves came during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a shared social media fan, you can feel like a man located on the top floor of a building gives desperate warning cries to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water bursts by the sea, taking buildings and vehicles away.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused widespread cutting of electricity supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to co-ordinate rescue duties.
Despite the fact that the army has begun sending humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, evacuees are still needing food desperately, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport has reopened for relief duties only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit evacuee centers in Palu Sunday.
The death toll for Indonesia's tsunami stands above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Despite World Vision workers in Donggala being able to reach the city of Palu safely, where employees tap into canvas shelters installed in their office's yard, during the route they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba claims.
\"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed\", he claimed.
It's a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the desolate gesture of starting relief work, some people complained that it was preventing humanitarian workers from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fund-raising, supplies and staffing from abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a catastrophe has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
\"It's still a disaster at the provincial level\", stated Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says it’s a national disaster, we can start calling for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared.”
As it fell on the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place Friday, friends and family members of the missing people maintained hope that the miracle would occur and their loved ones would circumvent the desolate account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was rescued trapped in a sewer.
Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr Mandagi, among the people trapped in Roa Roa hotel, were his students.
\"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden\", he pointed.
Mr Gendon explained that, in the hours after the fact that news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse among the parapentist community circulated, he had desperately sent messages for the WhatsApp to Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, messages appeared with a gray check mark rather than a double blue mark.
\"I think that means the messages were not received\", he added.
Thieves take $26,750 during the filling of an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport police department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated to the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM into the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his task, another man \"came close running behind the Brink's employee\" and stole a bag of money intended for distribution from him.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changed Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is renamed to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote, \"The being formally known as Kanye West.\"
It's been a while since West, 41, mooted him with the nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurs before her appearance on the Saturday Night Live program, in which she is expected to present her new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation with \"emotional reasons\", according to the program's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had earlier commented that the word has a religious meaning to him.
\"I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you\", West said earlier this year, while talking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
‘So it's you, it's us.
I've gone from Kanye, who means the one, to just Ye, who's a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more of a reflection than we are.\"
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year has announced his preference for Love and Brother Love names.
JAY-Z, West's former collaborator, has earned his nickname with or without dash and in capital letters.
Mexico's President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, when little is missing for the country to fulfill the 50th anniversary of a grueling retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that \"no military force would ever be used again to suppress the Mexican people.\"
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the deaths of 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were rooting all over Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
has stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds intended for AI
\"While China is becoming more active in the area of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money it devotes to research in this field\", states Kai-Fu Lee, investor and professional specializing in artificial intelligence that has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several US Government members have announced measures in the field of IA, despite the fact that in the country there is a general lack of formal strategy in AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the world's number 1 in terms of innovation in AI by 2030.
\"Dupling the budget intended for AI research would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are far behind the U.S. and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the AI field,\" Lee pointed out.
\"Duplicating funding could double the opportunities for the U.S. to achieve the next major discovery in AI\", Lee stated to CNBC in an interview conducted this week.
Lee, author of the book titled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Sinovation Ventures society, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent IA companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an IA system that surpassed the American Othello player with the best ranking and subsequently served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee positively rated previous US Government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge (DARPA), and wondered when the next would take place in order to identify the upcoming visionaries.
\"So often, American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships\", Lee protested.
According to Lee, \"it is not China that takes academic leaders; it is companies\".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university eminences to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the US task in the field of AI could also be driven with changes in immigration policy.
\"I think permanent residency cards should be automatically offered to doctorands in AI\", he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
\"The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Sciences Foundation and other public bodies in the U.S. give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior to China\", Lee pointed.
Earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, conceived for contributors to the industrial sector and academic institutions to participate, and the White House announced the constitution of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month the DARPA has announced a USD 2,000 million investment in an initiative called AI Next.
Regarding the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently allocates over 100 million USD a year to AI research.
Meanwhile, no measure has been applied for months in relation to US legislation intended to create a Commission on National Security in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide if they change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on changing their names to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia', a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, holds that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic-majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has protested that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign makes doubt whether the necessary 50% participation minimum will be reached for the referendum to be valid.
The question indicated on the referendum paper is, \"Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?\"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to attain the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to agencies such as the EU and NATO.
\"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live with freedom in the grip of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life\", opined 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
While not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have protested that it will abide by the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Election Commission reported that no irregularity had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, the stake was only 16%, compared to 34% registered in the last parliamentary election, held in 2016, in which it voted 66% of registered people.
\"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe\", declared 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which would open to him the way of membership in the Union Europe and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of Skopje's Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by the people who would boycott the referendum.
\"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with the high head, not the back door,\" Kavadarkov exposed.
“ We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asian integration.\"
Prime Minister Zaev claims that incorporation into NATO will come accompanied by investments rather than necessary in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate greater than 20%.
\"I think the vast majority will vote in favour of it, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO\", Zaev pointed before depositing his ballot.
Zaev protested that a \"yes\" would mean the \"confirmation of our future\".
In a poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Political Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another poll, run by Macedonian chain Telma TV, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70% stated that he would vote \"yes\".
For the referendum to be valid, the stake must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would mean the first hard time for pro-Western Government policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero of Manchester City makes a goal after retaliating the entire Brighton defence
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2–10 victory in the match at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute on a play that looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine lead received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He left for speed between three Brighton defences, raking with what was coming out of him on the pitch.
Then Agüero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He regattaed a defence before overtaking a few more on board the Brighton area.
He then made a pass to his left which found Sterling.
The English lead returned the ball to the first touch, within the area, at Agüero, who with his right leg beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a shot that sneaked inside the net on the right side.
\"Agüero has foot annoyance\", Pep Guardiola, City coach, communicated to journalists.
\"We have decided that he would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky I scored a goal at the time.\"
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
On that play, Agüero received the ball deep in field from Brighton and
made a precious pass into space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long pole.
The Sky Blues' lead finished the ball inside the net before walking out the bottom line.
City face Hoffenheim Tuesday in Champions League group stage match at 6:55 p.m., Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off fight, there were not much reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to go out to the mound of the pitcher Sunday that comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold an advantage game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have chances to play the play-off.
The Rockies secured a wildcard with the 5 to 2 win against the Nationals Friday night, but still seek to achieve their first division title.
‘Though we don't play anything, we can at least go out and throw out knowing the environment here, in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably contest every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to miss this match?\"
The Nationals have yet to announce an opener launcher for Sunday, but are apparently determined to let Scherzer drop if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a warm-up session Thursday and would launch Sunday, on his usual rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has an 18-7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 eliminations for strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
\"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections of our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones, I don't show up, but actually I do show up, so that's why I'm everywhere fighting for the great candidates,” he protested.
Trump continued: \"You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, is happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, their meanness is seen, their poor intention.
They don't care who they hurt, over who they need to go through to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them.\"
The Democrats' mission, he said, is to \"resist and obstruct\".
\"And this can be seen in the last four days\", he reeled, and called the Democrats \"angry, petty, dirty and false\".
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranked Democratic Senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, causing strong public scolding.
\"Remember Your Answer?
You leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no. Wait a minute...That was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen.\"
The Labour Party has ceased to be a diverse party.
It's intolerant of those who say what they think.
When my local party's Momentum activists voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of British parliamentarians who have told us that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she protested with determination against antisemitism.
In my case, with the censure motion I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, similar issues in respect of which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the notice of the Friday meeting of the Labour Partir of Nottingham it was communicated that \"we want meetings to be inclusive and productive\".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly so.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and it has long since forgotten the promise of \"more generous and kind\" policies, if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged depending on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision expected me to take a 180th turn and take positions he would never have adopted, be it on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say whatever I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made so that my candidacy is not renewed, centre policies are reported and I am told that it should not be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, as the messages I receive are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who have to deal with a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they don't snarl.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of 'no confidence' or every change in the rules of selection, the party is more tightening.
In the last two years I have received many advice and have recommended that I keep my head down, that it not be so expressive and \"all would be well\".
But I didn't go into politics for it.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by Thatcher's negligent government, which left my entire class literally sunk, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, be it as a local councillor or as a Government minister.
I have never concealed my politics, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion Friday, I would tell them that at a time when the country walks towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey is not directed towards Nottingham Momentum, but towards my electors, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or no political interest will prevent me from acting, according to my opinion, for the benefit of the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeaten Ayrs lead the lead
Two last-minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs deserved victory in this vibrant Tennent's Premiership day game.
The Ayrs, who are the only unbeaten team of the ten, occupy the first position in the ranking table.
In the end, the local team imposed itself thanks to its defensive superiority and the fact that it knew how to take better advantage of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
\"The matches we've played so far have tested us and we still remain unbeaten, so I have to be happy\", he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose opined, \"Enhorabone for the Ayr, have taken advantage of occasions better than we have\".
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayrs ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, given for the match by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted trial.
Climo broadened the Ayr's advantage with a penalty and, right at the half, scored and converted a trial to put the score 17-5 in favor of the Ayrs at the break.
But the Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then, the match was interrupted for a long while due to the severe injury Ruaridh Knott suffered, who retired in berth, and on reprisal the Ayrs again extended the distance with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
Next, alternate captain Blair Macpherson was admonished with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted trial by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of heavy pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw yellow card to make a plating to Climo without a ball, from the penalty alignment, MacPherson recorded a counter try behind the Ayrs' penetrating mole.
Climo scored, as he had done it again almost since reprisal, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot by David Armstrong and passed the ball to third line wing Gregor Henry to score the fifth trial of the local team.
The Still Game series star appears to be ready to start a new race at the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, appears to be ready to move on to the inn sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed as director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-protagonizes with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comic partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it appears that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make any comment about it, although a source from The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's 'florent sector of restoration'.
'The Sea Is Ours': Bolivia, landlocked, expects the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters covered in aisle in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a sea blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazons are grafted with the motto: \"The sea is ours by right.
Retrieving it is a duty\".
Throughout Bolivia's landlocked territory, the recall of a lost coast in front of Chile in a conflict of grueling resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the longing to sail back across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
\"Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, wait with a positive stance for the result\", pointed Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at TIJ's resolution on large screens across the country, hoping that the Court of The Hague will dictate in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has much hope for Monday's resolution.
\"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean\", he promised last August.
However, some analysts think that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in Bolivia's favor and that, in case it did, things would not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The TIJ resolution, which occurs only six months after the final allegations were filed, indicates that the case \"was not complicated\", stated Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law specialist.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a setback in the past four years.
\"The current Bolivian Administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea\", Zárate pointed out.
\"The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile\", he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will keep talking at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this episode.
The two countries have not swapped ambassadors since 1962.
The previous President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally rapid.
Next Monday Bolivia will have \"an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile\" and an opportunity to \"put an end to 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits\", he claimed.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crusade.
\"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean\", he added.
\"Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past.\"
North Korea claims nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the US
North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong Ho, claims that his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a chimera to think that ongoing sanctions and U.S. objection to a statement ending the Korean War can cause North Korea to ever kneel.
Washington is suspicious to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament movements beforehand.
Both Kim and President. U.S. Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang takes the issue of giving up an arsenal seriously which the country considers the only means to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the latest range of large hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look for more.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented to the walkway a range of disproportionately sized extravagant hats from their SS19 collection, which ignited the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer the Instagram has been razed by very impractical hats, and this designers have brought their amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's outstanding piece was an exaggerated birch hat, adorned with a broad, feather-shaped wing that flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jewelled syndrias, a witch hat and, even, a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of stray masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of vivid colors, had sewn lips and seemed more of Hannibal Lecter than they did of high seam.
One creation resembled a full team of underwater, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a hollow ice cream cone.
And if you follow the big trends in fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats could implant in the main streets near you.
Large hats step on the heels of \"the Bomb\", a straw hat, with two-foot broad wing, which everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult tag behind the hat so impractical that it spread across social media brought another great creation to the gateway: a straw bag for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed in bather carrying it.
The raffia bag, dark orange, adorned with raffia locks and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: \"I hope I see people wearing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer.Note that the designer has had a major impact, it would be a pity that the demand for large accessories would be ignored.
John Edward: Language competences are essential to world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to offer a service of the best level to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we observe that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: \"If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will come to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.\"
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend on English alone if we want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of pupils who studied foreign languages obtained the top A note.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students earned a higher A rating in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital powers that children and young people will need without doubt in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are held in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to curriculums from independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Competitions Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave to the fact that they cost to cover vacancies, 17% was attributed to the lack of language competencies.
Therefore, language competencies are increasingly indispensable for preparing young people for their future careers.
Since there are more and more potential job opportunities requiring languages, these competencies are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with permanent competence like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of competition.
According to a poll conducted in 2013 by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% did not know how to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important to today's children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important work.
In Scotland there is diversity among schools in terms of languages being taught.
Some schools focus more on the more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK facing the future, by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, he will always be able to choose from a series of languages in independent schools, which rely on specialist teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the powers necessary to succeed, regardless of what the future depares.
In the global commercial environment of the current era, it cannot be denied that languages remain of vital importance to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered \"international communicative competences\".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
The wait has practically ended for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the minutes he will play have yet to be determined.
\"They will be more than one and less than 48\", Walton told the Lakers official site.
Mike Trudell, journalist for the Lakers, tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season calendar.
\"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready\", he reeled.
Trump's Mything in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign acts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled Trump rallies for the next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy is on hold, Trump intends to get support for the upcoming midterm election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can he be seen online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be seen online at the link that is specified below, through live video transmission by the YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing started this week with Supreme Court-nominated candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained due to allegations of sexual abuse he faces, while the Senate's planned confirmation vote remains on hold until a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans running for the delicate November elections to collect momentum.
Therefore, President Trump's five campaign rallies scheduled for next week are aimed at \"stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and the Camera of Representatives, according to Reuters.
\"Congress control is as important to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, in time as we are headed for a cramped campaign season\", pointed out a Trump spokesman who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could congregate supporters \"of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract Pittsburgh media coverage\", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
\"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him impetus in the polls\", commented Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: American team shows their ambition to keep hopes alive facing individual Sunday games
After three unevent sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So which side is the positive dynamic now on?
\"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're on a small positive beat\", Jordan Spieth stated as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little bit in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely for the form state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both count on three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is giving example.
The guttural cries of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his lap and put in a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the match on the 15th hole with a similar scream, of the sort that indicates that he believes the American team is not out of the competition yet.
\"You have to strive to the fullest and worry for your own party\", Spieth pointed.
It's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave a mark on.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple carry four out of four and make no mistakes.
‘Moliwood' were the only couple who did not make a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogeys Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the bustling public, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who partnered Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles at the first nine holes sank the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never had any choice to get out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see for the interactions between matings, the advice they give and those they don't give, and the way a strategy can suddenly change.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the USA team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, had questioned.
Europe reach the Ryder Cup final with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the fourballs and Saturday foursomes with a 10 to 6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to get two wins against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave their record, so far, on four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago to Hazeltine, dominated an unhesitating American team at the fourballs in the morning and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the foursomes and won two parties, but were unable to reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points at 12 individual Sunday games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to get four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known by the nickname \"Molliwood\" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to earn four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they knocked out a brilliant performance to beat an unflattering Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had crawled in two games Saturday, showed sparks of sporadic geniality, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who did not participate at fourballs in the morning, again partnered Henrik Stenson at foursomes and fell 2–0 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked as first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have it all facing on a pleasant, windy day in south-west Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set Saturday a landmark for the Americans getting two points.
They achieved a 2–1 win against Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter at fourballs and later won back Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4 to 3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team had gone back a four-point difference to individual games, although Furyk's team, title defender, only needs to draw to retain it.
However, after being second best for two days, it appears that a coming Sunday counterattack is out of reach.
North Korea declares it will not be unilaterally disarmed 'in any way' if no signs of confidence are appreciated
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs communicated Saturday to the United Nations that ongoing sanctions were intensifying their distrust of the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate, in any way, its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken \"important goodwill measures\" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test center and committing to not proliferating nuclear weapons and technology.
\"However, we don't observe any response in line from the US\", he said.
\"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament in any way.\"
While Ri resumed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a 'by-phase' denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it took paulatinely measures, his statements seemed significant for the fact that it did not refuse full-fledged unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referenced the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US president in office and a leader from North Korea to Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the \"denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\", while Trump promised assurances for North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to put an end formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has communicated that Pyongyang must remove its nuclear weapons before.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
\"The U.S. insists that denuclearization must first occur and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, as well as opposing the \"end-of-war declaration\", Ri pointed out.
\"The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that ongoing sanctions are intensifying our distrust.\"
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: \"If the part involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea rather than the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnation situation\".
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he kept last year, when he stated to the UN General Assembly that targeting US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President \"Mr. Evil\" Trump called Kim a \"Rocket Man\" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to 'completely destroy' North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but protested that there is still a lot left to do and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that \"it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months\".
China and Russia contend that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated Thursday to the UN Security Council that: \"The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and final denuclearization\".
The Security Council has pushed sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006 on a bet to cut funding from Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then to communicate that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying breakthroughs had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of making \"proper requests of a gangster\".
In a meeting with Moon held this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took \"measures in line\".
He said Kim had communicated to him that the \"measures in line\" he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habitudes
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep longer, in an attempt to combat culture, increasingly extended, to study throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
An academic observed that often the world's number one university students are dejected by what goes to the basic aspects about how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Son Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
\"At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said: 'Why do they tell me now, all of this, in my last year.'
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me\", he reported to The Telegraph newspaper.
In the course, first implemented this year, students are explained the basic concepts about how good sleep habitudes improve academic and sporting performance, in addition to general welfare.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, claimed that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered from serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory, where students must click on cups of coffee, curtains, bamboos and books to receive information on the effects of caffeine and light, on how it affects sports performance at lack of sleep, and on the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are reported on how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of suffering heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
\"We know that the conduct of students will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects he has on health smoking cigarettes\", Professor Czeisler pointed out.
The pride culture of staying awake all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and growing pressure suffered by students make sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Making sure to enjoy good quality sleep for long enough should students' \"secret weapon\" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a mode of inanition and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes the past year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened its eyes and inspired it to promote the course throughout campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask graduate students to conduct a similar studies program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact that they put an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and be aware of the detrimental effects of the 'blue light' that the electronic displays and LED lights emit, which can alter the harmony of circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disbanded team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home which is another stumbling block outside.
Ibrox's conjunto sought to add his first home win since last February's 4–1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as coach to leave his team drifting, 8 points from the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half, and it never seemed like Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equal the score.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climb to third position, behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And Rangers might face further difficulties afterwards, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object he apparently threw from grad.
Gerrard made eight changes in respect of the lineup that swept the Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven headliner who tore a point against the Hearts last week. most likely, he felt satisfied by the way his, well-organized team suffocated their rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored within two minutes of the match, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder shot deflected and wasted the big occasion.
A striking missing pitch from Keaghan Jacobs topped captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot at the rear pole.
The Rangers were done with control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their game at the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a penalty at the fifteen minute signal, as he and Steven Lawless topped, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only led two shots to gate the first part, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head-on blow and docile forward Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi's first act on the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers could not deal with Jacobs' worked play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to pick Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at pause in changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. the change had a virtually immediate impact, as the extreme made a pass to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the lock.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the visitors' attention by playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after another.
Holt's side could have surrendered the direction to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a deflected shot from the coroner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton still asked for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made a big eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger count
And now a page on the Sunday Morning-- Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting-- the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans--Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as - Geiger accountant -
The Geiger counter, which has been a pillar of science since then, also became a pile of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film, \"Bells of Coronado\" starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, seemingly failed cowboy physicists:
Man: 'What a day is that?'
Rogers: 'It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emanating from radioactivity to minerals.
Evans: -Sure it's bursting now -
-Hans - Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system (see) malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system (see) and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize is malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory
It can be seen, a protein common to many cancers and then reinject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with diverse cancer types.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw ovarian cancer suffering disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab so that they can see -- a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then reinject them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A.: ‘The resultants we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine.
The HER2 protein - favours the growth of various types of cancer - including breast, ovary, lung, and colorectal, has explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach consistent with extracting immune cells from patients, and teaching -- these cells how cancer cells treated has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West clutched at a pro-Trump diatribe with an MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL program.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was scolded in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in that he congratulated the US President, Donald Trump, and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began criticizing Democrats and reiterating his support for Trump.
‘Whenever I talk to white people, they say to me, ‘How can you like Trump if he's a racist? ’
Well, if I cared about racism, I'd left the United States a long time ago -- he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee for sexual assault complaints filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval on social media.
It has not been clear if Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated between backdrops because of the cap he was wearing.
- They threatened me in the backs.
They told me not to go out with that cap on.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position -- he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: \"You want to see the lower position -- as he said he'd put on Superman's cloak because so they couldn't tell him what to do. \"You want the world to move forward?\"
Try and love.
His comments provoked the public's scolding at least twice and the team members of the program seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, that he had a reporter explain in the post: 'The entire studio was completely muted.'
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former rapper Mac Miller had died some days ago.
West left much of the audience perplexed with the interpretation of the song I Love it, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West gained support from conservative group TPUSA chief Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of the bravest spirits: GRACIES TO DESTACH OUR MULTITY.'
But debate show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just--being who she is and that she's absolutely wonderful.--
- But I chose not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we -- he added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now – the formerly known as Kanye West –
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the missing music legend Prince changed her name to a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge for stabbing at Belfast restaurant

Throne Game star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for depicting the role of swordsman Jon Snow in the HBO medieval violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the manly hero stereotype, by stating that these roles give insight that young boys often believe that they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with Culture magazine of The Sunday Times, Kit said that he believed – something had gone wrong – and that he questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married the throne-playing co-protagonist, Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that she feels strong determination to face this problem.
‘Personally, now I wonder where we have been wrong regarding masculinity,’ she says.
- What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?
According to Kit, television can have part of responsibility for increased toxic masculinity thanks to its such manly characters.
He added: ‘What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have to have that facet of manhood?
I think it's one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because something certainly has gone wrong with young boys.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series finale is scheduled for next summer, all saying he is fed up with battles and horses.
Beginning in November, Kit will star in a replenishment of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best that has provided him with Game of Thrones.
- I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life on the move - she claimed.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character representing Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series winning an Emmy.
The couple entered into a marriage in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Sida: China notifies 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are over 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officers.
Only the second quarter of 2018 40,000 new cases were declared.
The immense majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike what was happening in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health officers at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV by sexual route is a serious problem for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination from the LGBT collective is common.
Considering the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to the lack of precautions suited to sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to medication for HIV as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies an employee leaked data from Republican Party senators and dismantled dangerous--and--conspiracy theories--
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced Saturday the accusations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican senators from the U.S. on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the lawsuits were driving them critics and far-right websites.
“Thinkings, lies, and more despicable lies,” Waters stated in a statement on Twitter.
Supposedly, the published information contained the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and published it someone unknown in the Capitol during a Senate commission session on sexual abuse complaints against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to Waters' office and revealing the information of a Waters staff member, denounced the Capitol.
This unsubstantiated complaint is completely false and a pure lie -- Waters went on.
- The member of my staff, identity, personal data and security that have been compromised on account of these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for this leaking of information.
This baseless complaint is completely false and pure invention. -
Waters' statement quickly generated criticism online, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This denial is full of indignation -- Fleischer wrote.
‘That makes you think you have no temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone gets accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
You don't have to show challenging.
He doesn't have to question the accuser's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's criticism of Democrats, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to overthrow Waters in the mid-legislation election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
‘Important if true,' he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the authorities and security forces pertinent of these fraudulent statements.
We will make sure the offenders were revealed, he went on, and that they will be legally held responsible for all the actions they have carried out and that they have harmed each and every member of my staff.
Johnny English Strikes Again criticism: limited spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is already a tradition to search for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this franchise repose of Johnny English's action-comedy parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and re-appeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous autosatire about how despicable we are will be a new export opportunity of the country?
In any case, the incompetent eye out and rubber-faced Johnny English has been able to renovate for the second time his license to thorce it all. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious Atkinson traveller who represented Barclaycard's now-forgotten TV ads, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good times on this last JE trip.
I loved the approaching Johnny English guy in a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and propeller leaves repicuated on his helmet.
You see Atkinson's gift to physical comedy, but humor seems pretty fluffy and strangely superfluous, especially because film brands -- serious -- like 007 and Mission Impossible now already include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems intended for children rather than adults and, to me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as witty or focused as the muted gags of the character Mr. Bean depicting Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, which causes the dismay of the service agent, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and harassed figure, who already suffers from a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson donates the best of herself with this bald character of Teresa-May, but the script comes no further.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as every active spy gets in danger, he will have to recover some retirement one.
And that includes the ill-fated Johnny English, now employed as a teacher at some luxury institution, but teaching extra-official classes on how to become an undercover agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his sequestered yardyard Bough, a role that re-represents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So, Batman and Robin from when things get really ugly in Her Majesty's secret service get into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular - femme fatale - Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister dangerously falls under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous insanities: disguised as waiters, they set a French fast-food restaurant on fire, sow chaos by smuggling aboard Volta and English's luxury yacht causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize itself with the inside of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been drawn from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all seems like a children's program.
Pretty normal stuff.
As with Johnny English's other films, it has not been helpful to think whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that he did justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and cover five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of the companies to spend the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers by giving them a further day of partying.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would receive the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would fit the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The change to a four-day work week is supported by trade union confederation Trades Union Congress as a method so that workers can profit from economic change.
An experienced Labour Party source stated to The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that fits into the party's prospect of balancing the economy in the worker's favor and the party's overall industrial strategy. -
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not jointly support this aspiration currently.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: \"A four-day working week is not party politics and the party is not considering it.
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of the anonymous directors and speculators in public service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also imply that the shareholders of the water companies might not recover all the investment, since the Labor government could apply deductions for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on companies boards and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector firms' shares to employees, who expect to funnel dividends annually for a value of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains at -60 Minutes - if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their minds.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week, and has raised the question as to whether the agency's findings could influence some Republican senator withdrawing his support.
In an interview that will be published Sunday, the correspondent for the -60 Minutes - Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was shown more open than his South Carolina colleague.
\"I'm serious,\" said Kennedy.
- I said I talked to Judge Kavanaugh at the session.
I called him when it all happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had done so.
He looked steadfast, determined, and secure. -
But Graham's vote seems etched on fire.
- I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would file an explosive indictment - he stated.
- Dra. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it -- added Graham by referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
- And none of the people who appoint will be able to verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I can't see it's going to change anything new.
Have you done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event this Saturday, which presents an absolutely impressive star program, which carry out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse awareness of the overall goal of the event to end extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defense group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people helping to actively combat it.
To receive a free entry for the event, attendees had to do a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, phone calls, or any other activity to raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
What successes have Global Citizen reached now that he has 12 years left to reach his goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way of persuading her to demand a call to action or simply a further case of what we call \"clicktivism\" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million shares - of their supporters, which have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped stimulate world leaders to announce equable commitments and policies to more than USD 37 billion, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 engagements and advertisements derived from their actions, of which they have already disbursed or raised USD 10 billion at least.
The group estimates that at the moment protected funds have exerted a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the founding The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and realtors based in the United Kingdom, which is committed to - helping children grow as much as possible - and promises to send USD 35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 Global Citizens tweets.
(Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens members, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a foothold in history - said The Power of Nutrition ambassador, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.)
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and infants with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of their website's P+Fs asking for -- what makes you think we can end extreme poverty --
Global Citizen replied: \"It will be a long, hard road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and previous apartheid defense movements, we will succeed, because together we are stronger. -
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at the this year's event in New York, which will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as an - blockade - to impede Russian energy exports (Inner Secretary)
Washington can, - if necessary - turn to the Navy to stop Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, has revealed US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has reported that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
- I think the reason they're in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe - has allegedly said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to stop their energy from entering the market -- it has stated.
Zinke was addressing the event attendees held by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group self-defining as the (energy consumer's) voice in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are effectively equal.
\"The economic option in Iran and in Russia is to take advantage and replace fuels,\" he said, as he indicated that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option by European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, turned Berlin into a -- captive -- from Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion USD and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's earnest opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of disloyal competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak stated after a meeting with US Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US's stance has led to a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main sector organisation, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has appealed the US to turn away EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply -- Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren has claimed that she will – think in custody – her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren claimed Saturday that she would – think in custody – her candidacy for the presidency after the mid-legislative election.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
\"The time has come for the women to go to Washington and fix the government's divide, for the women to hold high positions -- he said according to The Hill.
- After November 6, I'll take my candidacy for president seriously.
Warren intervened on President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and claimed that he was taking the country in the wrong direction -
- I'm frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy - he said.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, \"It's clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election\"
However, a poll that was published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed it should not be presented by 2020.
About fifty-eight percent of the voters -- probable -- from Massachusetts, they said the senator shouldn't show up, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
About thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed wider support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in connection with a possible nomination for 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator for Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would reveal his decision officially in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites TEPT Track Palin affected at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
Monday night he was arrested and charged over a domestic violence incident
- With what my own son has been going through since returning, I can understand other families suffering from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers return to - told the public at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest - the elephant in the room - and said the following about his son and other war veterans: - come back a little different, get hardened, come back wondering if there is respect for what his fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other army members, have given the country -
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged for domestic violence with a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and arms tenure under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed an amicus curiae Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs. Sessions case lawsuit that the American Union for Civil Liberties filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner, and the children of the violent gang member, assaulted her, but US officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the US, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine declared on Friday that the new policy - ignoring decades of state, federal and international legislation -
Federal laws require asylum lawsuits to be awarded according to the facts and particular circumstances of the lawsuit, and this ban infringes on this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy denying immigrant input harms the US economy, since it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and - provide for necessary jobs -
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant any further asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
- Asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion - said Sessions in his June 11 announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never intended to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply into a splinter to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation becomes more and more desperate.
'The atmosphere is very tense,' said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she reassured her child with fever at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance is carrying bodies.
There's a lack of drinking water.
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to take flooded belongings and try and save what they can.
There are hundreds of injured, and hospitals, damaged by 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside the Palu military hospital, as patients are treated out due to the strong shakings that are repeated.
Tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the hotel's fifth floor room where he met his wife and daughter.
- There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think -- Haris told Associated Press, and he added that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
- I heard my wife cry for help and then I heard her no more.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay.
US ambassador accuses China of harassment with propaganda announcements\"
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in an American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed last Wednesday China Daily's pay supplement to The Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of immisciating itself in the US Congress elections of November 6 U.S., accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get immisciated in the US election marked what US officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to insert advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently travailed in a trade war that intensifies and has seen oranges rise in mutual imports.
China's vengeful oranges at the outset of the trade war aimed to punish exporters of states, such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, stated that Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and companies in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion paper on The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: \"It's rehabbling harassment with publishing propaganda ads in our free press.\"
In divulging their propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and free press to insert a payment announcement in The Des Moines Register -- Branstad wrote.
On the other hand, on the street down here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and see no real reflection of the disparate views of Chinese citizens being able to have on China's troubling economic trajectory, since the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party - he wrote.
He added that, one of China's top newspapers dodged the offer to publish, but did not say the publication's name.
Republicans turn away women's voters before mid-legislation elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
Since many of the leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several lawsuits for sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming mid-legislation election.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans already officially show that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone - explained Grant Reeher, a Maxwell School political science professor at Syracuse University, at The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last-minute pressures of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation to be conducted are sufficient to calm angry voters.
\"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, not tomorrow or November,\" said Karine Jean-Pierre, lead counsel and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants shouted, \"november is coming\" while protesting in the Senate lobby as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to the Mic.
'Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will be out of the chart,' explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst on the news site.
- People say they've been high already; that's right.
But they could have been more, especially among the voters of female in younger suburbs and voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don't vote while they don't like the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony, where he detailed his demands for sexual assault on the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed with confirmation.
\"This has become a mess for the GOP -- said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee president, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
It's not just about the vote of the board or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh sits on the defendants' bench, he also has to do with how the Republicans have managed this issue and how they treated it -- he pointed out Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be divided between those who believe in Ford's stela and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the balance being decryed slightly towards the last.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents undoubtedly believe or likely in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to believe undeniably or likely Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that he believed Kavanaugh had probably lied or undeniable during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed Ford's same.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating lawsuits filed by Ford and, at least, from another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez denounces that the Supreme Court candidate taught him the genitals at a party while studying at Yale the 80's.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to doom the world.
- We have to do it now - he said of the emerging company.
- It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's platform technology to allow users to create their own personal online data storage - or a pod.
It may contain contact lists, to-dos lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a browser at the same time.
What is exclusive to the personal online data store is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it personal empowerment through data.
Inrupt's idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to integrate appropriate resources, processes and aptitudes for the Solid platform to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications via the tools available at the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said no one on his team is talking to--Facebook and Google about whether a radical change needs to be introduced where all business models are completely empty overnight.
- We're not asking them for permission.
In a Saturday media post, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice at the network's neutrality debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
- I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web - added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the I GM Victory Cross Clergyman
The only clergyman in the church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and reverent Bernard Vann obtained the keeper on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the most important British military honour.
His two grandchildren uncovered a memorial tombstone at a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was – magnificently symbolic – that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's guarded prowess.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal – through a very thick fog and under intense cannon and machine gun fire –
He later ran to the line of fire and, with the very mighty courage, made the row move forward before throwing himself on a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment astonished.
The lieutenant colonel was shot down by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a feat that could never match, which produces you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who ran out of sleep all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine you stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206 and refuse to watch the most important event.
San José's poster contained 13 struggles, including six from the main card and were to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, UK viewers were astonished when programming switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted to have spent the night awake until the morning to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change for cartoons as a kind of vomiting joke.
Government regulations say at 6:00 this content is inappropriate, so they switched to children's programming -- said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
- Peppa the little pig, yeah.
Bellator company chairman Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
- I think when I think about repetition, I think it might work - Coker said.
- But there it is six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won't be able to solve it until Sunday in our hour, Monday in theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed channels, there were a lot of messages going and coming, and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. it was a governmental problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six like we normally do.We tried to show it again by the followers, but it was over.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt--lower--about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old sportswriter has stated that he did not realise until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights to give – hope – to other people.
He also said that being a father had remained important to him winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a wrecker on Laverne’s first program, said that she felt like she felt - less than - others because - it was not socially acceptable as children -
He said the following: \"To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference, they have been real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph\"
He wanted to prove that it was – something – he said, not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image the previous year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give – hope – to other people.
The world's tri-champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American realtor, Dustin Lance Black, who met me in 2013, - took me by surprise -
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 older than him, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you go through so much when you're young (he participated at his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone the same age that he's experienced high and low alike.
The couple were parents in June of a child named after Robert Ray Black-Daley, according to Daley, – all their perspective - has changed.
- If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold - he said.
- There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie. -
His son is said to be like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
\"I couldn't tell him--father, you won't be there to take the front row--he said.\"
\"While I held his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then that he was dead, I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible,\" he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
\"I knew that was what I'd dreamed of all my life--jumping in front of a crowd home at an Olympic Games--there wasn't a better feeling--he declared.\"
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Proud by Heather Small), which he had listened to during preparation for the Olympics and which still put the hen skin on him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worsened Mickelson appeared at the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record Sunday in playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to become an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will take part in the biennial event to hit a record for the 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for the modes:fourballs - and - foursomes - on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments deals his time between making an animator and working on his playing on the field, hoping to rectify that which hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for Le Golf National's difficult trajectory, where the long rough tend to punish deflected blows.
And if his own trajectory isn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, at the ninth game Sunday, will face the precise British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson's party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
‘He understood his role for that day, made me a palm on my back and surrounded me with my arm as he told me he would be ready the next day,’ Furyk said.
- He's got a lot of self-confidence.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed much to these teams previously and this week.
Probably, I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I figured more of it, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we should move forward.
He wants to be there just like anyone else.
Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of the top number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has not matched his individual record.
Mickelson has earned 18 wins, 20 defeats and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has contributed intangibles to the team.
\"It's funny, sarcastic, joker, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great partner for the team -- he's explained.
- I think younger players had fun getting in with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He brings a lot more besides his game.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advantage may soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with considerable advantage the individual last day Ryder Cup duels can easily become a tough day.
The Danish started 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they got the win by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
-You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and Valderrama, where we won, but by little - claimed Bjorn, in the picture, after seeing the 2018 team win by 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score at 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History has taught me and all members of the team that isn't over yet.
You have to go to every machine tomorrow.
You have to go out there and do everything right.
This isn't over until the points go up to the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I've already said, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also keep in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world -
Enchanted with the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: 'I'll never rush with that.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow individual performance will make a difference and changes everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all going well, but individual duels test your ability to play golf as much as possible.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself too.
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his player to render better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on last day's rendezvous, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before eventually losing in the - Medinah Miracle - which won Europe.
He answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, motivated his players earlier in the last day.
We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but we want to start with a good footing, as was seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment depending on the circumstances and in the best way to try to do magic tomorrow -
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the rendezvous against Rory McIlroy at the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
- I chose that order because I think it covers all possibilities - says Bjorn on his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Army should have been finalized in 2014 to replace the old Cold War era warships, but it will not, at least, until next year following faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the -- Rheinland-Pfalz -- the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but post-construction problems have marked the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Army commissioned in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-bug missiles, as well as technology against stealth actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other prominent features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these ongoing delays imply that vanguard ships, which were predicted to be able to project into Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they go into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was already reported last year, when the German Army refused the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Armada returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known about the reasons why it has been returned, but the German media has cited several -- material and technical defects -- from the ship that made it unusable if used on combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as approximately 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the former Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
Moreover, the ship's weight has also been known to be excessive, reducing its performance and limiting the Army's ability to add future improvements to it.
It is believed that the - Rheinland-Pfalz - of 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by Germans during World War II.
Besides faulty materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached an astonishing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of €2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, if recent warnings are taken into account indicating that Germany's maritime military power is being weakened.
This year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Army is running out of ships that can be used.
The officer has claimed that the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were no longer used, but none were provided again as a spare.
He has regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Army.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
A new investigation conducted at an estate in the Highlands of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed.
Discoveries are expected to be able to provide new data on the behavior of these only flying mammals and assist in future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common bats, in addition to northern and water-edged bats at the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations on the property to track bat activities during the station.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The sound analysis of recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed image on a scale of the landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation advisor to the National Foundation of Scotland, expects the results to show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has been considerably reduced in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do the matamosque role and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, the ears are more useful to them than the eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated localization technique for echoing to place insects and obstacles that stand in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is taken bats very seriously.
He has ten experts with the proper training, who conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues habitually.
Even, the organisation has created Scotland's first and only reserve dedicated to bats on the Threave Estate estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate's administrator, David Thompson, states that it is the ideal territory for the species.
- Here in Threave, we have a large area for bats - he claims.
- We have old buildings, many old trees and a whole good habitat.
But we are still unaware of many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us to understand better what they need to grow.
Remarks the importance of checking if there are bats before doing maintenance work on properties, as it may be that possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young people, resulting in the disappearance of an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Rat Conservation Foundation officer, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He has stated: - We still have to learn a lot from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data about their population -
Ronaldo denies the rape charges as his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the allegations of rape against him are – false news – and has claimed that people – want to become famous – thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
The frontman of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a room at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Presumably, he paid at the time $375,000 for the incident not to become public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video of Instagram Live on which he addressed his 142 million followers hours after the accusations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed they were -- fake news --
- No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says the five-time Gold Pilot winner on camera.
- They want to become famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything's in order -- he added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the charges, which they have called inadmissible information of suspicions about private life, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has claimed that the player will seek to obtain compensation for – moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant breaches of personal rights in recent years –
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed in the Court of Clark County District, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him he was about 99% good boy - except for about -1% -
The documents contend that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sex, but were consented to.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of his injuries in the hospital, but later accepted an agreement outside the courts because he had a spate of retaliation and was concerned about being publicly humiliated.
The woman, 34, claims she is seeking to overturn the agreement, as she continues to traumatize over the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to set up Real Madrid coming from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer has spotted Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of €100 million.
Brexit: The UK - would always regret - losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would always regret it if it lost its world leader's state in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He has added that it was – worrying – that Toyota's UK base has stated to the BBC that, if the UK left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at Burnaston's factory near Derby.
- We need an agreement - Clark claimed.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the event of an unagreed Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced last year 150,000 cars, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production is to be stopped at our factory -- Marvin Cooke, Toyota Managing Director at Burnaston, has claimed.
Leaving the EU with no agreement on how trade will work with the rest of the EU countries has aroused fears from other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims that it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is carried out on a base – just on time – with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for car manufacturing.
If the UK leaves the European Union without reaching any agreement on 29 March, there may be riots at the border, which the sector considers could generate delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to retain inventory for over a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a consequence.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is -- calibrated accurately to avoid these border checks --
We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity -- has stated on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
- Testing not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers indicates that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.
Toyota has not been able to confirm for how long production would stop, but, in the long run, has warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of Unite the Union at the plant, has claimed that members are starting to be very concerned about the situation: -For experience, when these jobs are lost, they never return -
A government spokesman has stated the following: \"We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU\"
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be backdated
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be -- put on a week -- as the fight continues over the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in White House statements Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the job of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and aid to Trump and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fired the deputy Attorney General and put Mueller's independence at risk, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times already reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record the talks with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump has claimed that he would – prefer not – fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate-wide vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she answered the following: - No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may delay another week for all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed,
Some journalists might refute this statement: Sanders has not made any White House briefings since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of briefings was not because he didn't like the bragging of television journalists, although he said: \"I won't deny they're bragging.\"
Next, he implied that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
\"The president asks more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president,\" he said, before adding the following without quoting any sources: \"We have consulted this data --
Sanders has claimed that the briefing sessions will continue to take place, but -- if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it is very infinitely better than talking to me.
We often try to do this, you've seen us do a lot in the past few weeks and replace the briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press wheels with dignitaries on official visit.
Individual press wheels are uncommon.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal appearance and, in some moments, strange in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers of Scottish National Health Service following fears of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU personnel working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes they will continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months from the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of state applications for residency for EU citizens working at delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: – During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union over exit have continued, and everything seems aimed towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in case of a possible scenario without agreement.
I know it's convulsive times for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate now that I appreciate very much the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, bring valuable experience and stresses that strengthen and improve the task of health service, while benefiting patients and the communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, backline of the Tennessee State Tigers has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ, of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed has communicated to the press that the injury occurred shortly before the half.
- He came to the line and collapsed there - Reed said.
Trainees and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him in a litter and taking him in order to run further tests on him.
A Tennessee State officer has informed Chris Harris, of WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris has added that - there is still no information on the type or scope of the injury - and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is Abercrombie's first season, second year, with Tennessee State after pitching there coming from Illinois.
He had completed five platings Saturday before leaving the game, which make it a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher bell tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher bell tax when buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new Conservative Party plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Hisenda hopes to get up to £120 million per year to help people homeless.
Foreign buyers are expected to be recorded a higher bell tax on buying a property in the UK and that money will be used to help homeless people, a measure Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in bell tax will be recorded in those people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will be allocated to government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current bell tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to obtain up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's newly built properties are of non-British residents, making it increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up to the property scale.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become a ghost town, following the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a reduction in bell tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the major constructs of keeping property prices high by purchasing land quickly and not using it, and urged May to overturn quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's real estate disaster.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as rent checks and completion of evictions - no guilt.
He also wants to give city councils more power to build new homes.
May has stated the following: 'Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work, and create a life here.
However, it cannot be correct that it is just as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to British inhabitants who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home on the property is too distant and the indignity of homeless people makes everything even more real.
Jack Ross: -My utmost ambition is to train Scotland -
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has claimed that his – his very own ambition – is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman has accepted the challenge of reviving the northeast club, which currently ranks third in League One, three points from the leader.
He reached the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
- I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me once as support and that's all - he has declared Ross on BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
‘But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland play Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it's always something that keeps me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I'm successful in training clubs, but--
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland coaching position include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach claims that he does not feel the pressure to be next on a list of names enshrined in such a large team, after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
- For the time being, my criteria for measuring my success will be if I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its site is the Premier League - it has claimed.
- It's not easy to get there, but I'd only consider that I've succeeded here if I can get the club back.
Ross only has three years of experience as a coach, after a period as the second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts' technical corps.
He helped Alloa avoid down to the third category and transformed St Mirren from struggling for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross states that he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player at the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
\"It was probably a decisive moment--he remembered about accepting the position at Alloa.
- I always believed training was what I was better at than playing.
It sounds weird because I did well, I got away with it reasonably and enjoyed enough good high times.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot you have to get through every week.
I still spend it in aspects like stress and job pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've felt since I'm an adult.

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has fired consumption at bars with Britain's difficulties, but has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have gained a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but consumption at restaurants has been reduced by 4.8%, as indicated by statistics.
Peter Martin, from CGA's financial advisory, the company that has collected the data, states the following: \"The continuous sunshine hours and England's share of the World Cup, which has been extended longer than expected, have in July followed a pattern similar to the one in June, with the increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption at restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by drink consumption, have got the best results, while consumption at restaurants has gone downhill.
Bars offering food have also suffered with the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
At the bars and taverns we've consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6 percent during the month, while food sales have declined by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of the leisure analysts and hoteliers RSM, stated the following: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to the sales of the external leisure market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of an inter-yearly 4.8% would be especially detrimental, more than continued pressure for costs.
This long, warm summer couldn't have come at a worse time for trades serving food and time will tell if the most moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide that necessary respite.
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those opened recently, has been 2.7% in July, data indicating the slowdown in brand presentation.
The sector sales indicator The Coffer Peach Tracker for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of over £9 million and is the sector's set landmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts hiding from parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to data from a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in pages – Insta's falsas –
News has brought up fears about publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students claim they have an account--mainly--that shows parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey among 20,000 high school students has given a rapid increase in accounts – false Instagram reference, the site for sharing photos.
News has brought up fears about publishing sexual content.
Some 20 percent of students claim that they have a primary account, netting that they show to parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to rape me.
The investigation, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Private School Directors' Committee (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of teenagers between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, of which half has admitted that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan has stated: \"It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them\"
Eilidh Doyle will be the – voices of the athletes – in the directive of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation directive at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the field and track athlete with the most medals in Scotland and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from its dillated experience internationally in the past decade.
The Eilidh has respect for the athletics community in Scotland, the United Kingdom and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive. Beattie has declared.
Doyle has stated: \"I'm looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can grow the sport and contribute to it in Scotland\"
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors told me only time will tell if I can recover or to what degree.
It's been exhausting, but I've fully recovered, relearned to walk and today touches on doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement.
A stripping ad comparing mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A tirannette company has divided opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows that are milking.
To mark the launch of what is considered to be the world's first silent stripping, consumer technology company Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a prank music video to show the freedom that gives mothers the new tirade.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of fodder and cows at the pace of a song that includes lyrics like: \"Yeah, I'm munching myself, but you won't see any tails--and--In case you hadn't noticed, they're not brags, but my tits--\"
The return goes on: 'Bomb, pump, I feed the babies, pump, pump, munch the girls.'
However, the announcement, posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, of which many claim to show the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
‘Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and peer to produce milk, the difference that they are removed from their babies a few days after they were parried -- a person wrote.
Elvie tiracing is discreetly concealed in a lattice bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented on the following: \"Awesome traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to announce a roll for mothers who will keep their babies -
Another user added, \"It's an off-site ad\"
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that finding the song was – fun –
- I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the roll made me feel exactly like I was a cow.
Advertisement is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as what it is.
It's a great product - it wrote a user.
Another person commented on this: \"It's a fun advertisement for mothers who pump with tirades (usually in their workplace or in the toilet and feel like they're cows.
It is not an announcement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the tirallet discreetly into the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say that they feel like they're cows when they use the tiral .
However, the Elvie tirallet is completely silent, does not have any cables or tubes and fits discreetly into a lattice bra, giving women more freedom to move, holding the babies and even getting out while pumping.
Mother’s early partner and early childhood developer Ana Balarin stated: “The Elvie tirallet is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
By tracing parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a tiral is used and the challenges it is supposed to do so, while demonstrating, entertainingly and didactically, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new tiral.
This is not the first time that the Elvie tirallet has ever been on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the gateway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrating children silently relocated to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of emigrant children held has increased even though monthly entries across the border have virtually remained stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made children's appraisal difficult.
Traditionally, most patrons were paperless immigrants, who have been afraid to put at risk their chance of staying in the country if they decided to take in a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential patrons and the other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking officer of the Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to host unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
- About 80 percent of the people who have taken in or lived in the home of a person who has welcomed are in the country illegally, and a vast majority of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore, we will continue to persecute these people - stated Albence.
To prosecute children more quickly, officers have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court in a month after being held, rather than 60 days, which was the prior standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by video conference, rather than face-to-face, to defend their case to obtain the legal state before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help, will be deported from immediate.
The longer children are spent in custody, the more likely they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramblings or escape attempts, according to workers and reports that he has made the system known in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified into larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of its size, signs are overlooked than indique that a child is suffering.
They have added that moving children to camp without having time to emotionally prepare them or say goodbye to friends can cause them with trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges - occupation forces - from the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Muallem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has already lasted for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as deputy prime minister, has claimed that foreign forces were in Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and - the matter will be dealt with accordingly -
- They must withdraw immediately and without condition - he said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the “war on terror has virtually ended ” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of people.
He has claimed that Damascus would continue - fighting this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory - of both terrorist groups and of - any illegal foreign presence -
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to form and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1000 troops on the ground of a country struck by war.
On the matter of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and he has blamed – some Western countries – for spreading - irrational bodies - that make refugees want to stay away from him.
- We have claimed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns - he has claimed.
- They're politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian -
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition occurs to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have claimed that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russia's help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has clear terms, and has expressed hope that military action will face jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, who will be eradicated.
Staffan de Mistura, U.N. envoy, hopes to call soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and preparing the way to elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of Syrian government participation in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to - review the articles of the current constitution - and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for a second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the election again in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, scandals and the process of removal end his presidency prematurely.
What it would be, no doubt, - the end of a more dramatic presidency in history -
At the moment, no signs of fatigue are seen in viewers.
Since 2014, the number of on-time peak audience viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and virtually tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on a peak audience schedule, since the 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and --MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major briefing nights.
People have been dumped because they don't understand, says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series - designated Survivor - about a cabinet decreer who happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of – Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club - has another theory.
He recalls a taxi trip to Boston prior to the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote Trump.
- Why-- he asked.
‘He answered that because he made her laugh,’ Scovell told me.
There's an entertainment point in chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families will be able to meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go further when you meet at the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources -- for private use -- for his book -- Fear -- Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich fur jacket -- a piece of thick clothes like his pride -- headlined the Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions Stormy Daniels made of, say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I'm not going to see Super Mario again.
\"Part of what makes it seem like that I'm part of a telereality show is that every night it gives you something new -- says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of --Pawn Stars -- about the changes in characters and the scripting twists of Trump's program (barring off with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because you stay behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house he has on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed shut looking at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not disengage, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
- I remember when we were doing those crazy programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization - he called me Fleiss.
- I thought it'd be a kind of joke, but it seems they were right.

External Money Floods Mid-Legislative Election Races in the Most Adjusted House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a cash flood in Pennsylvania's 17th district, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has caused two current members to compete for the same spot.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburg involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who gained the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, who conflicts with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decreed in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the parties' main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in a special election much in a row held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held office for over a decade and President Donald Trump won in the district by 20 points apart.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on the Savior for his support of China, but withdraws them
The diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response by Washington.
Trump held a strained meeting with Panama's president, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners threw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to remove the heads of the US diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for the 'recent decisions' over the ceasing to recognize Taiwan' declared Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department, this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador was contemplated, which received aid from the United States of $140 million in 2017, according to estimates, for drug trafficking control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on issued visas, would be detrimental to the Central American country and high numbers of murder and unemployment deaths.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar encounter maintained last year and that was seen as a step forward to stop emigrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to occur, effectively ending any likelihood of sanction for the Savior.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration gives there, according to diplomats.
The three US envoys discreetly returned to their positions of Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without hard messages or sanctions by Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton's White House refused to comment on the details of the debate that described the three officers, which include two diplomats, who agreed to debate internal deliberations from anonymity.
An external analyst, close to administration and also from anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study History
The next event to occur could be special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there are numerous evidence to public records.
As far as is known, Mueller also investigates whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be found rendering accounts to the body, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and, even, before a jury of party members.
They are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's downfall, or any of his European homonyms, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both shores of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to make a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted it and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed a chance to avoid all the years of terror that followed afterwards.
The course of history fluctuates on turning points like this and accelerates or backs up the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States faces several turning points currently.
What will happen if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, the deputy Attorney General, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water in his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly record the president and speculated that he was inappropriate for the post.
Rosenstein claims that the Times information is not accurate.
-How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in half a legislature for a Congress that will make Trump responsible for it?
If we don't pass those tests, democracy will begin to run into danger.
But I think we won't fail, because I already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles at that table with the swastika.
With this baggage, like I don't have to be optimistic about the future.

Graham Dorrans, of the Rangers, optimistic facing the match against Vienna Rapid
Rangers receive Vienna Rapid Thursday, aware that a win against the Austrians, after an impressive draw in the field of the Real Town this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify to the Europa League G group.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from being able to play the first few minutes of the season to 2-2 draw against Vila-real, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to get great results.
It was a positive point for us, because the Real Village is a good team -- the player claimed, 31 years old.
- We played the party, believing that we could get a valuable result, and we got away with a point.
Maybe we could have taken something more out of it at the end, but, in general, probably the pitch was a fair result.
They were better off in the first part, but we were better off than they were in the second part.
About Thursday, it's another big European night.
We hope we can stay with all three points, but it will be a difficult match because they brought out a good result at the last party, but I'm sure we'll give everything and achieve a good result with the support of the hobby.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes to the club, but now it's a good place to be able to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it all up, leave last season behind and be successful -
Women lose sleep over fear of savings for retirement
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
Approximately half of respondents nationwide claim that they have spoken to their partner about the cost of long term care.
Only 10% of respondents claim that he has spoken to the children.
People want a family member to look after them, but they don't dare to raise it -- said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company nationwide.
We need to start over here.
Talk to your spouse and your children: you cannot prepare your family to care if you do not communicate your desires with sufficient anticipation.
He works with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to receive attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Includes your financial adviser to the conversation: It can also help you determine how to pay for such expenses.
Your funding options for your long-term care may include an insurance policy for traditional long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy of effective value that helps you cover expenses or insurance of your own with your own resources, if you have the money needed to do so.
Prepare Your Legal Documents: Cut Step into Legal Battles.
Look for a representative so you can designate a trusted person who oversees your medical care and makes sure professionals fulfill your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary empowerment for your finances.
It is appropriate to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of disability.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your elderly relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor to be determined, but also with which doctors you want to deal with -- Martin indicated.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a severe earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, authorities say that the death toll is expected to increase.
Since the communications are cut off, the relief units could not obtain information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Some important data on Palu and Donggala, Celebes Island, are included below:
Palu is the capital of the province of Celebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Celebes Island, with an estimated 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency extending over 300 km of coastline northwest of Celebes Island.
The regency, a lower administrative region than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Celebes province, especially in the Donggala coast region.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but is concentrated, mainly, in Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, there was also a tsunami west of Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific firebelt and there are usually earthquakes there with some frequency.
The main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are listed below:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that tore down the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 rocked an area to pop in the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 rocked one of the islands of Mentawai, on the Sumatran coast, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that shattered dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but over 100 people were killed due to buildings falling.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the tourist Indonesian island of Lombok that killed a further 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The quake shattered thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges for assault.
Palin, 29, a natural from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspected domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a well-known woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she stretched her phone.
Palin is detained at the interim detention center in Mat-Su, where he is held with an unsecured obligation of USD 500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he pleaded not guilty, for sure -- when asked how he declared himself, according to that string.
Palin faces three Class A faults, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to USD 250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B fault, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 USD fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges were recorded against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interference with reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in relation to the incident.
His partner stated that he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups for associating her child's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead

Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack who killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan and hit pedestrians and cyclists during his path, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must show that Saipov killed the eight victims, intentionally, and that he intentionally incurred serious personal injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both offences could amount to a death penalty, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with a writ of prosecution with 22 faults that included eight charges of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of motor vehicle violence and destruction.
Prosecutors claimed the attack required considerable planning and premeditation and described Saipov’s act as unhumane, cruel, and depraved.
-Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco - according to notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last time the southern district of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
Police explained that he claimed to investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the prosecution writing, Saipov explained to authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also called for the ISIS flag to be deployed in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 faults.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, claimed that they were -- obviously disappointed -- with the prosecution decision.
- Let's consider that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a declaration of guilt and a life sentence without the possibility of freedom will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved - Patton stated.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative party parliament member claims NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilise popular troops during a protest at the Conservative party conference today.
UKIP’s previous leader has claimed that politicians must feel pressure from Eurosceptics, when one of Theresa May’s own members of parliament suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP without charge Peter Bone told Birmingham's march that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Ms May faces when reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when the Conservatives in favour of the union have come forward in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The Prime Minister is fighting to retain her Chequers commitment plan between attacks by Brexit supporters, union supporters and the EU.
The allies insist that he will make it to an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr Bone told Solihull's Leave Means Leave rally that he wanted to undo Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been nominated as a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he'd been in charge, we'd be out by now - he said.
Member of parliament Wellingborough added, \"I will defend Brexit, but we must undo Chequers' commitment\"
To precise their opposition to the EU, he added: ‘We did not fight world wars to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country -
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions stating that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: \"The idea that the British population has changed their minds and wants to stay is totally false\"
Brexit Conservative supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and stated in front of reporters: 'I'm just telling her, Prime Minister, that I listen to people,'
Chequers's commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the street and get us to win an election.
Abandon Chequers’ engagement and start listening.
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: \"The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises\"
Mr Farage said that rally politicians must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
- This is now a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class - he claimed.
- They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we're not going to allow them to--
In a message to the enthused crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.'
We are mobilizing the popular troops in this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK -
Meanwhile, union supporters made a march for Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists stirred banners on the Conservatives against Brexit following the group's launch this weekend.
Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the safety problems they suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada agreement plus plus plus plus, for the border without friction, for free borderless trade in Ireland, he added.
- It's a complete sham.
There is no option for a good Brexit - he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of running as a presidential candidate
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will examine the possibility of running as a candidate for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Saturday, Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He has been a centre of speculation on the possibility of taking up Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was their 36th meeting with constituents with the open meeting format since Trump took over.
An assistant asked her if she planned to run as a presidential candidate.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome.
One person arrested for the shooting death of Sims, from LSU
Baton Rouge Police, La., announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 ET press conference.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday and requested collaboration to identify the man from the footage.
Sims, 20, received a shot and died near the Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
-Wayde Sims got shot in the head that finally killed him - commented on police officer Murphy J. Paul Saturday in the media for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and he was taken into custody in the district police department East Baton.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 starts during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton earns the world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas remained ahead of Lewis Hamilton Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play an important role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and nearly exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into boxes before and let Hamilton run with the traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at boxes and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after some wheeled action which caused the Ferrari driver to leave the inside free with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third coroner.
Max Verstappen started on the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap was going in the seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good standing much of the race, as he retained his wheels to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen and move into fourth position.
He eventually entered the boxes on lap number 44, but was unable to increase the pace at the next eight laps and Raikkonen stood in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and it was a real lord who was told to let me pass.
The team has done a fantastic job to have a one-two - Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday to insist on her not leaking Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but remarked that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are -- painstaking, cruel, and lying --
\"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful of what's going on in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, bad, cruel, lying people,\" he said.
- When you look at the releases and the leaks and they say--No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer-- did you leak the document?--
No, no.
I didn't leak it.
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked-- no, we didn't leak it.--he added while impersonating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak proceeded from his office.
- I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statement, I didn't leak her story - she told Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
‘He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, just as he asked.'
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night rally: ‘You know what, his body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, charged with inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purpose.
- They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see the badness, the cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to hit for power and control -- the President claimed, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's defeat at the Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back 5 to 3 in Dundee Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained a two-goal advantage thanks to the finishes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie moved up their team level, but, afterwards, Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard equalised the Dundee. Then, two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured his win.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who came from winning Dundee 2–1 in Belfast Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assist from Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assist, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this early agitated period, Sullivan placed the home team back in the game in the 13th minute:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equaliser in the 15th minute:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the Giants' advantage on the first break when he got the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to their level with a powerful goal in the 27th minute:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the match at the end of the second part and guaranteed their team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are home, to Milton Keynes and have their next game Friday.
Air Controller Dies to Save Hundreds of Passengers From An Earthquake Plane · Global Voices
An air controller from Indonesia has become a hero after he died to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake shook Celebes Island Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are taking place in the area and there are many people trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
But, despite his comrades escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place in the trembling control tower of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure Batik flight 6321, which was on the track at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then, she left the air traffic control tower when she thought she was sinking.
He died later in hospital.
A representative from Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
- This has broken our hearts - he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has communicated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
- The death toll is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that could not be accessed - Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency representative stated.
The waves, with a height of up to six metres, have devastated Palu, who will hold a common funeral Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying aid and groceries.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: 'Every minute, an ambulance is carrying corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the minimarkets have been looted.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: \"The Indonesian Red Cross works clockwise to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find.
This is a tragedy, but it could still get worse.
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu Sunday and told the armed forces: 'I ask you all to work by day and night to complete all duties related to the evacuation.
You are ready - he communicated CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the crash in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that is going to crash into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has been missing, although they previously said the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, since Saturday afternoon, they did not find a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
Local transports helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities communicated Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the US Navy claimed that the plane moored in the lagoon because the runway was short of it.
Some witnesses think the plane overlooked.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
- That was extremely positive - Jaynes claimed.
Jaynes said that himself and other passengers managed to walk with water by the waist to the plane's emergency exits, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and began shouting, and that he suffered a slight head wound.
The US Navy said that sailors who were working nearby to improve a dock also assisted in the rescue with an inflatable craft to transport affected people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded at PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concludes the case Saturday in reviewing the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness to the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to build the movements of the accused, 29, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his earlier statements, as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Saturday, Sanford denied this and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when she claimed she was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said she had lied, as her truck was in Nashville.
Another incoherence was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the text messages, calls and Chambers' contact information from his phone.
- He erased her from his life - Hale said.
The defense plans to start its final arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to pass by the jury throughout the same day.

Another black person?!
NY leader sues a couple for dismissal after a message-racist--
A New York-based nanny reported a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother protesting because she was a black person.
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the lawsuit with an extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay at seeing that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAW AWO AWO AWARDA PERSON NEGRA--typed Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But, instead of sending him to her husband, he sent him to Mrs Maurice, twice.
After noticing her pyphia, an uncomfortable -- Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nanny she had fired, who was African-American, had done her work wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs Maurice received the corresponding payment to her day's work and, afterwards, she was sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice claims the couple compensation for the dismissal and asks for compensation of, roughly, USD 350 a day for the six-month residency job for which they had hired him, although there was no contract.
- I want to show you that you can't do things like that - he told the Post Friday, - I know it's discrimination.
The pair have responded to statements that they are racist while claiming Maurice's dismissal was most reasonable, as they were afraid that they could not trust her after she had offended her.
- My wife sent him something he didn't mean.
It's not racist.
We're not racist people -- the husband, Joel Plasco, claimed to be in the Post.
‘But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on.
Plasco, who compared the lawsuit to an extortion, claimed that his wife had two months left to have a baby and was in a very difficult situation.
- Are you going to pursue something like this?
It's not a very kind attitude - the investor banker added.
The legal case is not yet settled and the public opinion court has been quick to report the couple on social media and to condemn their behavior and logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter: 'It's hard to put herself in the place of someone who first liges her before its publication.
It's funny now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success.
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before having the inspiration to write the children's book about a small teddy bone, was optimistic about the book's rejection.He also said that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was – grudging – after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and adds that his father was very proud of it, of the success he had finally achieved.
‘He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous one, ’ he said.
‘But, since Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son gets something: you pride yourself, even if it's none of your business.
I think he thus considered Paddington's success.
Though it was his creation and imagination, he always used to acknowledge Paddington's own merit. )
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, they took their daughter fast to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
\"Nad frequently called to say that he was very sorry and that they didn't expect me to get over it -- Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse commented.
\"I've got a call from Nad, and he told me he'd die in the next couple of minutes, and I had to say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, ‘Tashi, I love you so, beautiful.
I'll go with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs they had given him so that his body would continue battling were consuming and they were getting out of his system.
He had died earlier than planned and so it all went off.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn't yell or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family members and more people.
I had to keep up the good shapes.
Eventually, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted from the experience that was going on.
- No one knew - he said.
- He had a cot head and tears kept falling.
It turns out hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad overwhelmingly.
The feeling that I needed my love and my understanding.
I know I wanted her very much.
Grief Women Hang Cards to Prevent Suicides on a Bridge
Two women who have lost loved people who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call to receive assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13, when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, killed himself.
- I don't want any father or mother to feel what I need to hear every day - he said.
Mrs Davis, 45, with residence in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
- Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile could light up any room. -
But he quit his job before he died because he was at a very dark point.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after his own life had been taken off.
Mrs. Davis said: 'I'm continually concerned that there's a collateral effect.'
Mrs. Davis created the cards, for people to know there are people they can turn to, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent: you need to talk.
Mrs Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, a short time after Mark's mother died.
‘He never said he was not well or depressed or anything, ’ he said.
‘A couple of days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He touched deep on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and he did not look them in the eye or anything. -
He said that his death is a great trauma to them, but that they have to work it out: \"Open a hole in the family.
It shatters us.
But we must go on and on and on and on -

Brett Kavanaugh's future is held up by a thread as the FBI starts an investigation
\"I thought if we could get anything like what he asked for -- an investigation with limited scope and time -- we could get some unity -- said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and he also added that he feared the committee would destroy itself with the related death toll of the supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
Five weeks away from the November 6 midterm election. if, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, weaknesses will be seen in getting the man they want to get elected to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the senators and press them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI creates their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where, currently, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea – falls – with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, while citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry said that 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that strict border checks between North Korea and China and rising prices covering people traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Usually, the vast majority of deserters in the North are offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul sources claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers migrant deserters illegal, rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the standing negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to get a Korean peninsula free of nuclear power.
But Saturday, North Korea's external issues minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
- Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally - stated Mr. Ri in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is an hysterical and unfit to work on the High Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Superior Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is an - hysterical - and that his temperament incapacitates him to work on the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival that is held in Austin, Texas.
- I can't help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have told her she's an hysterical - said Pelosi in connection with her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh, thrilled, denied the charges of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh proved very excited, sometimes screaming and running out of words while talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the charges against him entailed a – grotesque and coordinated murder of a character – organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not work at the High Court, as he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
- I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats - he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
\"That's what I can say, if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he's not only not capable of being in the High Court, but not in the court where he is now,\" Pelosi commented.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge on the Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about decisions she could make Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she considers herself a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he evaded questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the High Court.
“ There is no time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the Court and hope it may seem wonderful, ” said Pelosi.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diatribe: months and years of plenty of fury and it can't get her out without crying.
‘We cry when we get angry,’ Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
- I don't think it's common.
She went on to---I was very much helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me she was crying when she was angry too, but she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, telling the person she was talking to:--Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.
And then it went on.
It seemed brilliant to me.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because, basically, they misinterpret.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a male-majority office, where I once ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of a greater woman (a cold directive who had always terrorized me a little) who grabbed me from the necktie and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
\"Never let them see you crying--he told me.\"
- They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad, because they'll have you. -
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic MP from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital adventure on a vessel called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no motive not to explore the idea of running herself as a presidential candidate.
“ It wasn’t a well - pondered decision, ” she told me while I was laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone said of it. White and seven Dwarves.
Since she was late for the campaign, she was backdated with fundraising, so she promised she would not access the race if she did not raise USD 2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated $1,000 USD to the men were only willing to give 250 to her.
- They think I have a discount - he wondered.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system over the difficulty of raising money and for guiding herself to voters, rather than doing so to delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she ran out of words.
\"You might have thought you had a nervous breakdown--remembered Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press.
- I thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, What will they put in my grave?

How the US-China trade war can benefit Pekin
Initial salvages of the trade war between the U.S. and China were deafening and, although the war does not seem to have to end soon, a distancing the countries may prove beneficial to Pekin in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the US, issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed taxes on China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new oranges affecting products worth USD 200,000 million. these oranges entail an imposition of taxes on half of all goods reaching the US from China.
Pekin has counterattacked every time in the same way and recently uploaded the five- to ten-percent oranges for USD$60,000 million of American goods.
China has pledged to replicate the U.S. and the world's second largest economy is not likely to backfire next.
Making Washington back up entail giving in to some demands, but bowing publicly in front of the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
Yet experts say that, if Pekin plays his cards well, the pressures of trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run in reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Pekin could create the conditions that initiate a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than the witnesses had anticipated,” states Abigail Grace, an Asia-based associate at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is \"prepared\"\" for refugees to return, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of over seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
(Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism - he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that terrorists shattered to restore normality.
All conditions are met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and maintenance.
The EU calculates that over 5.5 million Siris have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime thanks any help in re-building the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional help or help from the countries that funded the insurgency.
Europe selection earns Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Europe's selection has achieved the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American selection with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive times on European ground and they have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European selection won the crown again when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, pulled the blow out into the water at the par 3 16 hole, which yielded the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone to all his series and became one of four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was put away with a 5&4 by the less qualified European selection player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 career points.
- I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a really tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so glad I got the drink back.
The team is the most important thing... and I'm happy I could have helped - commented on an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition Sunday.
- I'm incredibly proud I won Tiger Woods, grew up following him - claimed Rahm, aged 23.
Woods lost all four games he had in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players that have existed, with 14 major titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American selection struggled all weekend to search the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke out after his team's frustrating performance: 'I'm proud of these players, they've struggled.
There has been a time when we pressed European selection.
We fought.
I take off my hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's to take off your hat.
We've been defeated.
