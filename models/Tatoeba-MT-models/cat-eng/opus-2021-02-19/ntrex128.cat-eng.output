Members of the concerned Wales assembly to "identify them as Muppets."
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay to the amendment proposal of their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has emerged from the plan to change the name of the Assembly for the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this arrangement may become mocking motives.
A member of Labour Party's assembly said his party cared about the fact that MWP "nearly with Twp or Pwp."
For non-Glalesian readers: In Welsh, Twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party's assembly commented that the set of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and proposed several alternatives.
On his own side, a conservative Gallish member has claimed that his group was "open" in front of the change of name, but he also commented that there is a very small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" in Welshman speaking similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire.
According to the assembly committee to draft the legal draft to enter the names' changes, "The final decision on any qualifications for naming the Members of the assembly will certainly resupport themselves."
The Law of 2017 of the Galles government gives the Wales Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with a broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of the members of the assembly, though the committee was decanted by "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the "MWP" option is that received a broader support for the public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting several alternatives, but the attempt to achieve a consensus can lead a head to the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal message about change in weeks.
Legislation of reforms will include changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on dequalification of its members and the design of the committee's system.
Members of the assembly will celebrate the final vote on their denomination during the debate regarding legislation.
The macedones will vote on the referendum in their country's name change
Citizens will choose Sunday if they want to change their country's name for the "Norther Macedonian Republic".
The popular reference was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted decades with the neighboring country Greece, who already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that his neighbor's name north represents a way to claim his territory and has repeatedly been opposed to the attempts in this country to become part of the U.S. and NA.
President Macedoni, Gjorge Ivanov, against the featuring the change of his name, said he'll ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favor, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price they have to pay to become a member of the United States and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Stop Sounding: Harlem's Challenges · Global Voices
"Historically, the elderly people I talked to said there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Evenue in daylight, there is no one left."
According to Adams, the bar disappearance can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he says.
"The bars have already stopped being those kinds of living rooms for the neighborhood where people periodically went."
Regarding churches, he's concerned that the money that gets caught from the sale of assets won't last as long as what his leaders predicted "and that sooner or later come back to where they came from."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and meet the kinds of people who will not be in any help for the temples remaining in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people buying condominates in these buildings will be of white race," he says, "and so what they will speed up closing all churches, since it is highly unlikely that most people who move to these condominate condominates will end up being members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolice; the Metropolitan Church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white methodist congregation left during the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's spent at the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycottt at 125th street retail merchants, one of Harlem's leading commercial streets, who resisted to hire or promote black race people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage in the building, and when Reverend Johnson's congressesses made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they commissioned the wagon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of the father Johnson and successor of his at St. Martin's church, described the lane as "the poor people's bells."
The expert who sounded the caterpillar in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert Tiffany Ng at the University of Michigan also observed that it was the world's first carrillion that was touched by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest carrilon of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's not replaced him.
What's sounded like at St. Martin's during the last few months, however, were the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them led by church secular leaders and others by episcopal diocesy.
The council, the ecliptic organ of the parish, made up of secular leaders, wrote in the diocei last July, expressing his concern that the dioccesis "presisted the cost" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the contractation of architects and contractors that the dioccesy sent.
Some congress have complained about the lack of transparency from dioccesis.
A shark wound a 13-year-old boy while looking for locusts in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy during an immersion to find locusts in California on the first day of the locust season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place right before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Incinitos.
According to Chad Hammel at the KSWB-TV of San Diego, he was carrying about half an hour looking for friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy's screams, asking for help, so they swung a group to the place where the boy was to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was the joy of holding a lobster, but then he realized he shouted 'I've bit!
They bit me!'
He had the full shrill plate," Hammel observed when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone came out of the water, I cried out, 'There's a shark in the water!' adds Hammel.
The boy was sent by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was severely engrossed.
You don't know what the kind of shark that's responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, the Soviet Larry Giles commented that a shark had been detected in the area for a few weeks, but it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered from traumatic wounds in the top area of the torso.
Authorities shut down for 48 hours, access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinithas due to investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of sainsbury's, towards the market for U.K. beauty goods
Sainsbury's decided to make the competition in Boots, Superdruug and Debenhams with a flock of beauty products in the style of the great warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These great corridors are only one part of a substantial investment in the market of beauty products in the U.K., a market that moves about 2,800 million GBP and continues to grow as the fashion sectors and products in the home are all over, and they will be tested to 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores a year that comes if the test becomes a success.
Investigation in beauty products is a product of supermarket advisence to exploit space in their shelves that was previously destined for TVs, microwaves, and home products.
Sainsbury's claims he'll double his beauty offer to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing formulas of the Orreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with marked areas similar to what are found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the rellance phase of their range of Boutique make-up products so that most of the products are now tight for vegans, one more and more aspect of asking for younger consumers.
The recorder The Fraple Shop, in addition, will open terms for two shops in sainsbury's, the first one did it last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second one will open Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
You buy them online and your change into a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made the great supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of sainsbury's, stores will become ever more like a large store in an attempt on the supermarket chain to fight against the supermarkets of discount Aldi and Lidl with more services and no feeding products.
Sainsbury's gone pointing up Argos sales points to many of his supermarkets, plus a number of shops in Hubby since he acquired both chains two years ago, which he says, has served to retaliate the groceries and increase the profitability of addictions.
The preceding instinct of the supermarket chain of relaiding their beauty and pharmacy product departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's done an operational test coupled with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended hasty when not agreeing on how to divide the profits from the pharmaceutical chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale of sainsbury's three years ago from their 281 drugs business in Celesio, owned by the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plane as it extends the range of luxury brands for skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a commercial director of Sainsbury's, says, "We've transformed the aspect of our beauty product corridors to improve the environment of our customers.
We invested in workers specifically that they will be of great help in offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the appealing environment and the practice of making us now one of the favorite destinations for beauty products and we challenge the traditional way to buy."
Peter Jones "Durious" after Holly Willoughby back off a deal of 11 million GBP
Peter Jones' star left "furiating" after Holly Willoughby took her back from a deal of 11 million GBP with the lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and IV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to devote himself to the home company and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had become compared to the Gwynethaltrow brand.
This Morning’s host, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' star for Peter Jones in anger at the last minute of the lucrative set of lifestyle trade to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring great benefits.
According to several sources, Jones was "furiating" when the star blonde TV admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, which the new presenting agreements, for the value of 1.5 million GBPs, meant that he would not have enough time to devote to the set of products from home and accessors Truly.
The business had become like the Goop Mark of Gwyneth Paltrow and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, who was 37, used Instagram to announce his departure of Truly, Jones took a private plane towards one of his vacation resides outside the United Kingdom.
According to a source, "Truly was the top priority of Holly.
It was meant to be his long-term future, and where we would see it for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to step back left the whole part unresponsively implicated.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of goods in the middle of Marlow about to be sold."
According to experts, the march of This Morning's host, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost millions to the company because of the important investment that had been made on products, from pillows and candles to clothes and clothing for home, and the possibility of delay for its launch.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Cape for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Cape in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined President in charge of March.
Both couples spend their vacations together, and Jones owns 40 percent of participants in Baldwin TV producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S tag ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a host of the program I'm A Celebrity at IV.
A source close to Jones commented last night that "We're not going to make any comment about his business."
Bare accusations... and then we fell in love.
He joked about the possible criticism he would receive from the media to make a comment that some would consider to "own a president" and to have such a positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did you give up Trump so much?
Trump stated, mocking the voice tone of a news host:
"I have forsaken nothing."
She noticed Kim had an interest in holding a second meeting after Singapore's first celebration was declared a big step towards shutting down North Korea.
However, negotiations towards nonnuclearization are stung.
More than three months after the summit held in June in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ring Ho commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that Korea in the North doesn't see a "resposed" United States's "repossite for correspondence" in the earliest initiatives of disarming in their country.
However, he observed, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's view, however, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well in North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we keep this great relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: end of evidence with missiles, help to free hostages and return to the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his uncommon approach by talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this precinct full of people, we would have about 200," said Trump, pointing out the crowd that stood before him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After Lombok's earthquake, for example, he told non-governmental organizations that were unnecessary.
Though more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared prior to the provision for an international aid.
"Really, in many cases, they have made it quite clear that they are not calling for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," Mrs. Sumbung says.
If Save the Children is planning a team to go to Palu, it's not safe even if foreigners can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesperson of the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palau to see whether it is allowed in international agencies to contribute to offering aid.
Given the sixth constants of Indonesia, the country is still unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Even though in Achah there have been shelters in the event of tsunami, they are not frequent on other shores.
The lack of alert sirens in Palu in case of tsunami, although there was a warning in force, it is very likely that he has contributed to the number of deaths.
Displacing between the enormous amount of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics harder.
A hospital ship that was lured to Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is now heading for Palu; however, it will take at least three days after arriving at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as the central element of his electoral campaign to improve the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure, and has invested enormous amounts of money on roads and railway tracks.
However, Joko's government faces the year that comes to the re-election loaded from funding deficies.
Joko also deals with the pressure of the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where majority Muslim members have adopted a more conservative cocktail faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced are the result of fights taking place on the streets between Christian gangs and Muslims with manches, arches, and arrows, and other sanctions.

The statue of Cromwell of the British parliament became the latest monument affected by the discussion about “rewrite history”
Their disappearance would be a sort of poetic justice for the purest style of Taliban many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as a "borgery" and a "rewrite-of-the-story".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Westminster palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconology of the English civil wars was not ordered or conducted by Chromwell.
Maybe it would end by sacrificing the Cromwell wrong for the actions of his ancestor that he did in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure which many still believe is worthy of being commemoated.
Goldsmith told The Surday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered to many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as a parliament champion in front of external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
Whether this fact constitutes a fully accurate representation of the matter of historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th century mid-century conflict was the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents a side of this division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy to be celebrated and commemorated."
A fascist pig dies a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a Southwestern China market, according to reporting local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a carved artery and covered with blood near a heart of pigs in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday on South China Moring Post.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer of pigs was preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a court in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
As far as you know, she traveled Wednesday with her cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that led to a curtain of contiguous pigs.
According to the court there was a big male with blood in his mouth.
The coroner's exam confirmed that the 250-pig man had been killed by the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had broken legs and blood full," said the cousin, "Wu," as mentioned in the news of Guiyang's evening.
Security camera scenes show how Yuan gets into the market at 4:40 a Thursday morning to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither property nor of Yuan nor his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig was locked and isolated in order to prevent anyone else from attacking, while police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
According to the story, Yuan's family and market-makers are negotiating compensation for their death.
Even though it's very rare, pigs' cases have been recorded earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his Massachusett farm, and left the man with serious wounds.
Ten years earlier, a pig in nearly 300 kg took a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife got the animal scared.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC news that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "chained".
"They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they're not going with the idea of hurting.
Just give them the respect they deserve," he remarked.

Rosa will leave Monday until 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, the tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is coming to generate generalized torrential rains all over the southwest for the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste flows, and the possibility of land breaks in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause some precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
They expect from 50 to 100 mm of rain to parts of the southwest, especially largely from Arizona.
There is the possibility that they form a laugh, for the situation is rapidly getting worse because of the character scattered from tropical rains.
It's totally disproved to walk into the desert in front of the tropical rain threat.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to turn into controlled rivers, and the storms can carry wind and clouds of dust at specific points.
The depression approaching will bring torrential rains in certain areas along the southern coast of California.
It's possible that the total hasty precipitations over 50 mm could lead to smaller residing streams and slipping paths.
It would be the first rain season hastags in the region.
They'll start coming isolated rain shafts from Tropical to Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before rain becomes more generalized between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread in the Four corners on Tuesday and persist for all Wednesday.

Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected that October is hot most of the central and eastern region of the United States, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the South Planes area to parts of the northeast.
The New York City could be up to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above the average.

More than 20 million viewers saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million viewers saw Thursday the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, who presumably took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impression continued, with stations disrupting Friday's usual schedule because of a turn of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Jeff Flake to run an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee for judicial matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average spectators of the CBS, ABC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The audience numbers were not immediately available for other chains that broadcast the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Tools Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems with calculating people who see it from his office.
This is an audience similar to that of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most audienceed chain, with an average of 569 million viewers during the testimony of one day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second on 3,26 million viewers.
CBS got 3,1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to data from Nielsen.
The interest stands high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying they'd vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the cameras of the CNN and CBS on Friday morning while he was increated by protesters while trying to upload to an elevator to go to a view of the judicial business Committee.
Flak remained several minutes with afflicted view as she was live-down on TV at CNN.
"Here I am, before you," said a woman.
"You think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, 'You have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!'
Flak said his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the elevator were closed, he remarked that he'd have more things to say in the sight of the committee.
Within a few hours, all cables and broadcasting chains were already broadcasting live the time when the Court of judicial matters had to vote if he followed or did not proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate's full to submit it to the vote.
Flake said, instead, that she would only understand that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominate of her face next week, condition demanded by the Democrat minority.
Flak was convinced in part by the conversation he kept with his friend, the Democrat Chris Coons Senator.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, since it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation for allegations against Kavanaugh.

The spit in the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhood of Mexico's capital.
The national disaster prevention center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and to record 183 gas emissions and ashing in a 24-hour period.
The center was monitoring several streaks and tremors that were recently produced.
Images on social networks where a thin cedra layer was appreciated in the car parabris in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.

Police face Catalan separatists shortly before referendum's anniversary of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in support of independence faced riot police and thousands of people gathered in untouched protests to remember the first anniversary of the voting in Catalonia on their secession.
A group of independentists held by the riot police started throwing eggs and paintings in dust, which triggered the appearance of dark clouds of dust in the streets usually invaded by tourists.
Later on the same day, they came batts with the police, who used their fears to hold violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "No forget, let's not forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters shouting "Larga Life in Spain".
Catorze people had to be cared for light wounds in the protests, according to local sources.
The tensions have not diminished in this region of independentist mentality a year after 1 October celebrated an illegal referendum in Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, since the opposite of the secession did mostly boycott the voting.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting entering the entire region's election stations, causing violent clashes.
Independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support from the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electricist, and one of the participants in the independentist rally along with his wife, said he had no doubt about the chances of Catalonia’s independence.
"The last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents weeping with joy over the fact that they could vote, but we're stuck now," he remarked.
Despite getting a life victory, although by little marginalised, in the autonomic elections in December, Catalan independent parties have suffered to keep the push this year, since many of their main leaders are in a self-imposed or detaineeous exile, hoping to be judged by their role in the referendum organization and later statement of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the police' manifestation with his phone, and claims that the conflict has alerted him to the politicians on both sides.
"The tension has only increased," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections of the European Parliament on next year.
"Becoming candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the renewal in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.

Menga's move gives Livingston victory for 1 to 0 before the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first gol with Livingston was victory.
Livingston, who had been on a category this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which it was just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as an Ibrax neighbourhood Cook coach.
Dolly Menga's move marked the difference, since, with this victory, Gary Holt's team goes up in the second position, share with Hibernian.
The Gerrrards, however, remain without winning them out of the house at the premiership this season, they will face the leader, the Hearts, who separates them from eight points.
But before that, Rangers get this Thursday, Vienna Rapid in Europe, League.
Livingston, meanwhile, broadens up to six parties his ray invite on the league, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since Kenny Mier replaced last month.
Livingston doesn't take advantage of his chances in front of the direct game of visitors
Holt's team should have gone in front of the marker long before the gol, as his direct game triggered all sorts of problems in Rangers.
Scott Robinson stepped up his way to the defense, but was barred his occasion when he met in front of the portery, and then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out to try to rim the past chief of Craig Halkt, who crossed the portery.
The locals were nice to let the Rangers get near to their area, as they knew they could put visitors in trouble in isolated plays.
And that's how this decisive gol came.
The Arabic whistled against the interests of Rangers and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that he could play it first and postpone from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated his possession, but found himself in impenetrable defense and a portenter Liam Kelly who had little work over the party,
The stage was repeated to the second part, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop merit.
On his own side, the porter of Rangers Allan McGregor stopped with his feet one occasion in Scott Pitman and Lithgow tore another set of combinations of Livingston.
The Rangers hanged over and over in the Livingston area just to be rejected, and two criminals were demanded, one for an alleged Halket entry to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another by hand, both were dismissed.
Livngston "rename": Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result to Livingston.
An opined man who was excellent and continues to overcome all expectations in this descending path.
His style of play and staff almost haven't changed since they came back to the full category, though much of the merit must be attributed to Holt by the way he gallvanized the team from his arrival.
There was a bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, at the head of a perfectly organized defence, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell had to be pending Menga during the entire game.
Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Even the brilliant moments with Gerrrard as a coach have definitely failed to maintain the level.
They didn't know how to create times (only after the local defense was clearly over), and this is the Rangers on the average side of the table, it should be taken as a warning.
Reception aggress for Erdogan in Colombia
These were all clear smiles and skies on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, which aimed at repairing the relations between NATO’s two allies.
These were deteriorated due to such issues as human rights, freedom of press, and the urging of Turkey in the U.S.
Erdogan, on the other hand, moved to Colonia to start a new giant mosque.
And it is that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25 000 people from being gathered in front of the mosque, if a lot of supporters even gathered around them so they could see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurdish, were also made to feel as they condemned Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and dictatorship by others.

Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with important rivers (the drought zones could be beneficial)
It's not common for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen earlier this week that comes when what remains of the Rosa hurricane goes through the southwest desert, with the risky laugh consequent.
The national weather service has already issued rivers for Monday and Tuesday to the west of Arizona south and east of Nevada, the southerneast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight to Phoenix on Tuesday and be close to the night of the rainy Monday.
Phoenix's National Weather Service commented on a tweet that only “all due tropical cyclones have maintained storm state or tropical depression in a radius of 322 km of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed at least 64 km off the Arizona border."
The most recent models in the National Hurricane center were meant to be 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points to which they would register up to 150 mm in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other parts of the southwest desert, including central Rockets and the Great Conca, could register from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For the areas outside the rivers, the rosa rain could turn to a very good news, as the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although the riverboards are a grave cause for concern, some of the precipitations could be very beneficial, as the Southwest region currently suffers a drought.
According to US drought control service, more than 40 percent of Arizona State are suffering at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reportsweather.com.

According toweather.com, "they are expected from 75 to 150 mm of rain from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of them coming to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will be headed north crossing Mexico with tropical storm force, before she arrived at the border with Arizona on Tuesday morning with tropical depression, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach south Utah well into the Tuesday night.
"The main risk we expect from the Rosa or what's left of him is strong rushes in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the United States Desert," according to the Hurricane national center.
The rains are expected to cause dangerous rivers and waste flows in the deserts, besides land barriers in the mountainous areas.

"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for rejection in the brutal and outrageous characteristics of the Democratic party," he decreed Trump in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.

Hundreds of deaths by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by giant waves crashing against beaches because of a major earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered Friday for a festival held on the beach in Palu city when waves from up to six meters hit the coast toward the sunset, dragging many people to death and tearing everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude earthquake 7.5.
“When the threat came for tsunami yesterday, people were still taking their activities to the beach and didn’t rush quickly,,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the BNPB mitigation agency in a statement on Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, smashed everything that was on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that tsunami had displaced by sea at speeds of 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed up a tree running from the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
About 16 700 people had to be evacuated from 24 different centers in Palau.
Aeries published by the mitigation agency of disasters, which appreciates the amount of shops and shattered buildings, rotted bridges and collapsed mosques surrounded by water.
The mirrors kept shaking on Saturday.
The earthquake series were heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian technology's evaluation and application agency (BPPT) said in a statement that energy released by the intensive earthquake of Friday was some 200 times the power of the atomic bomb thrown over Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the city's geographical features, located at the end of a long, narrow bay may have increased exponentially the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, commented, were found trapped between the rubble of the collapsed buildings, adding 540 people were wounded and 29 out.
According to Nugroho, the dead and damage could rise to the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, nearer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications "were completely paralyzed, so no information came" from Donggala, says Nugroho.
There they live over 300 000 people," the Red Cross in a statement adds that their workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end a lot worse," he thought.
The agency was heavily criticized Saturday for not reporting on the arrival of a tsunami in Palau, although agents said the waves arrived at the time of the announcement.
In a recording of a social media shares, you can feel like a man on the top floor in a building giving people desperate warning cries about the tsunami approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall bursts near the sea, taking buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have launched a general cut from the power supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate the ransom tasks.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid in cargo planes since Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, evacuates still need food in desperately other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuated centers in Palau on Sunday.
The number of deaths by the tsunami of Indonesia is located above the 800.
The situation is very bad.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Donggala could safely reach the city of Palu, where employees empeled themselves in laon shelters in the courtyard of their office, during the trajectage had to witness total destruction scenes, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although relief groups made the gesture to begin relief work, some people complained that it was preventing humanitarian workers from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fund collection, foreign staff supplies and donation can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster occurred is declaring national disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” Alia Arrini stated, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, well, it's a national disaster,” we can begin to ask for international assistance, but it hasn’t declared that level yet.”
While the second night was in Palace after the tsunami and earthquake that took place on Friday, friends and relatives of missing people were hoping that the miracle and loved ones would be produced by the story of natural disasters.
Saturday, he rescued a kid trapped in a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue teams freed a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subando, the coach of the Indonesian national team, had trained two of the missing parapetists for the Asian Games, who concluded early this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, there were their students.
“As a senorient in the field of the parapent, I have my own emotional burden,” he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that in the hours after he circulated the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel between the parapetist community, he had desperately sent messages to the WhatsApp competitors in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think that means the messages weren’t received,” he added.

Raper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: “It was formally known as Kanye West.”
It's been a while since they've been in West 41, they've replaced it with nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurs before its appearance to the Saturn Night Live program, in which its new album is expected to be presented, entitled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the Ariana Grande singer, who canceled his share in “enemy matrimonies”, according to the program's author.
Besides being an abbreviation from his current artistic name, West had mentioned earlier that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ye is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” said West in early this year, while talking about his album's title with the Big Boy radio presenter.
“ As for you, it is us.
I've been through Kanye, which means the only one, just Ye, which is a reflex of our good part, our bad part, our confusing part, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of what we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have been renamed.

Mexico's President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Opbrador has promised never to use military force against civilians when there is little to make the country meet the 50th anniversary of a raw retaliation against students.
Lopez Opbrador promised Saturday on Tatelco Square that “the military force would never be used again to repress Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when the students' left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Opbrador, who has committed to supporting Mexican youths by giving student monthly grants and opening more free public universities,
He has declared unemployment and lack of educational opportunities by young people who are attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double AI funds destined.
“While China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money that is dedicated to research in this field,” says Kai-Fu Lee, a investor and an artificial intelligence expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several American government members have announced AlA measures, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in AlA.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number one in the world regarding innovation in 2030.
“Duplicing the budget destined for the research in AI would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are much behind the U.S.A. and we want to be the pioneers for the next breakthroughs in the AI field,” Lee noted.
“Duplicing funding could double opportunities for the U.S. to achieve the next great discovery in AI,” Lee declared to CNBC in an interview conducted this week.
Lee, author of the book entitled AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houston Mifflin Harcourt, is the general director of the Sionovation Ventures society, who invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent CIAs.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an American system that overcame Othello’s American player with the best classification and later exercised as a executive in Microsoft Research and as chairman of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee appreciated positively theoretical competitions prior to the American government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defense Projects Agency (DARPA) and wondered when it would take place to identify the next visionary.
“Soving, U.S. researchers have to work hard to get public scholars,” Lee said.
According to Lee, "it's not China that takes academic leaders; it's businesses."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired university eminances to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the U.S. task in AI. could also be driven with changes in immigration policy.
“I think they should be offered automatically permanent home cards to doctors in AI,” he added.
In July 2017, the China State Council presented its development Plan for artificial intelligence.
“The National Science Foundation of China grants funds to people of academic institutions just like the National Science Foundation and other public agencies give money to American investigators, but the quality of academic work is less than China,” Lee pointed out.
Early in the year, the State of Defense Department of the United States created an Artificial Intelligence Center Across Conceited to engage partners with the industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the constitution of an Artificial Intelligence Committee.
Besides, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
About the Natural Science Foundation, currently more than 100 million USD hits a year in search of AlA.
Meanwhile, there has been no measure in relation to American legislation which intended to create a national security Commission in Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians celebrate a referendum to decide whether they change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Madedoni people celebrated a referendum on the change of the name in "Burn Republic of the North Macedonia", a time that would solve a dispute that existed for decades in Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's accession applications in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its neighbor's name is a reclamation of its territory, and has seen its entrance to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments came to an agreement on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argued that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the most Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has protested that he will not take part in referendum, and a boycott campaign hesitates to question whether he will reach the least of 50% of his share in order for the referendum to be valid.
The question indicated in the reference paper is, "Are you in favor of accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The changing supporters of the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to reach Macedonia accession, one of the countries that were created after the disintegration of Yugoslavia, organisms like the EU and NATO.
“I came to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia could live freely in the area of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life,” Olivera Georgiejska, 79 years in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentaries has manifested the outcome of the voting to make it decisive.
To change the name, a majority of two-thirds is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularity had occurred at 13 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared to 34% registered in the last parliamentary election, held in 2016, where 66% voted for registered people.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” Gjose Tanevsky declared, 62, in the capital, Skopje.
First Minister Macedoni, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and her son Dushko voted on the Macedonian referendum on the country's name change, which would open the way to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
At Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with our top head, not the back door,” Kavaldarkov exposed.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don't want to accept us as Macedonia, you can turn to other countries like China and Russia and be part of the euro Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO's incorporate will be accompanied by investments more than needed in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate above 20%.
“I think that the vast majority will vote for them, because more than 80 percent of the citizens are in support of the EU and NATO,” Zeev pointed at his role.
Zaev said a "yes" would have "confirmed our future."
In a survey published Monday past by the Macedonian Research School, between 30 percent and 43 percent of voters would participate in referendum, a figure below the minimum necessary participation.
According to the results of another survey, directed by the Mexican Telma TV chain, 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I'd vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in referendum would first lead to the policy of the pro-occiential government since it took the emphasis on May last year.
Look at the video: Sergio Riverro, from Manchester City, he does a goal after he retaliated the entire defense of Brighton.
Sergio Riverro and Raheem Sterling overturned the defense of the Brighton in the victory of Manchester City goes by 2 to 0 in the disputed party in Ethad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.

He left by speed between three defenses of Brighton, raving with what was going on on his passage through the playing field.
Next, it was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He rebuked a defense before he overcame a few more on the board of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass on his left that found Sterling.
The english frontier returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area in Riverro, which with his right leg beat the Bright Brighton pigter, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that sneaked into the underside of the right-hand network.
“Next has trouble on the foot,” Pep Guardiola said, the city coach, to journalists.
"We decided that I would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that you have marked a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in fighting for Premier League.
His gol arrived at about 29 minutes.
In that game, Riverton and Brighten Ball was taken deep in the field of Brighton.
He made a beautiful pass in the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before he passed it to Sterling to the long pole.
The Sky Blues Frontman scrambled the ball on the inside of the web before it went out on the line.
City faces Tuesday on Hoffenheim in the phase of groupings of League at 185 pm, at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinheim, Germany.
Scherzer, with no options, wants to delete Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the struggle for play-off, there were no many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, is waiting to go to the Sunday shuttle that comes against Colorado Rockies, in case Rockies, who hold an advantageal game on Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League, have a chance to play Play-off.
Rockies secured a wild card with victory for 5 to 2 against the Nationals Friday night, but they are still searching for their first title of division.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can go out and get to know the environment here in Denver, and knowing that the other team is probably going to have every point at the highest level, as no one has.
Why would I want to miss this party?"
The Nationals still have to announce a open shuttle for Sunday, but they are apparently determined to let Scherzer slip if this situation occurs.
Scherzer, who would do his 34th opening, did a Thursday warmup session and throw Sunday, on his usual day's rest.

Trump makes a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the republicans participation in the elections of half of mandate.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
That's one of the big ones, big ones, and I don't really introduce myself, but I do introduce myself, and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for the great candidates," she said.
Trump went on: “You can see this horrible, horrible Democrat group, it’s happening right now.
They are determined to regain power for all the necessary means, to see their petty, unintended intention.
They don't care who's going to hurt, above who's going to go through to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we're not going to give them."
The mission of Democrats, he said, is "resist and obstruct."
“And this can be seen in the last four days,” he rebuked, and called "informated, petty, dirty, and false Democrats."
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the democratic senator of the highest rank of the Senate Judicial Committee, which led to a strong public scredge.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, uh, no, wait a moment... this was an expression of a very bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour Party has stopped being a diverse party.
He's intolerant to those who say what they think.
When the activists of my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a series of British parliamentaries to whom we've been told that we're not welcome, all to say.
My Parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because he manifested himself with determination against anti-Isemitism.
In my case, with the censor motion, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of an economic policy responsible for national security, over Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
At the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party of Nottingham reported that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Parliament, the meetings of the General Committee celebrated on Friday night have been exactly like this.
Sadly, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of “more generous and kind” policies has long been forgotten if ever existed.
It is increasingly clear that divergent opinions are not tolerant of the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged depending on whether it is acceptable for the party's direction.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, because colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political vision expected me to take a 180o turn and take positions that I would never have adopted, national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made to stop my candidate, it denounces the centre policies, and I'm told it shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually politicians.
I'm impressed by the professionality and determination of colleagues who each day face a stream of sexist and racist attacks, and don't "round."
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era was politics to see how the abuse level was normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're not that diverse party anymore, and with every motion of "non-trust" or every change in the selection rules, the party is getting more pressed.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice and suggested that I keep my head down, which was not so expressive, and "It would all be all right."
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my study time, stimulated by the negligent government of Thatcher, who left my whole class in a literally crumbling, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, whether it was a local advisor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Notingham East could ever doubt my political positions and points disagree with the current direction.
To those who promote the motion on Friday, I would tell them that at one point the country is walking toward a Brexie who will harm homes, companies and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
But in fact, the message I want to convey went not to Notingham Momentum, but to my constituents, be Labour member or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of renewaling my candidate or any political interest will prevent you from acting, according to my opinion, in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose — Ayr nested in Leader · Global Voices
Two last hour trials distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr have deserved victory in this vibrant game of Tennent's Premiership's Day.
The Ayr, who are the only immature team of the ten, take the first position in the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that he knew better at taking the opportunities, and the coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
“The parties we have played so far have tested us and we still remain nested, so I must be glad,” she said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: “Regrats for the Ayr, have taken advantage of the occasions better than we are.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the minute 14, turned by Frazier Climo, put up front of the Ayr, but a yellow card for the Scotty Hughes Internet, ced by the Warriors party, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the numeric superiority and Jason Baggot a non-Create rehearsal.
Climo extended the advantage of the Ayr with a sanitation and, just in the middle of it, he noted and turned an essay to put the Marker 17-5 in favor of the Ayr on the rest.
But the Melroses started the second part and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, turned by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then the party was interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott was suffering, who retired in a stretcher, and the Ayr repression re-taliated the distance with a test in Stafford McDownall turned by Climo.
Then, the supreme captain Blair Macpherson was an ammonited with a yellow card and, again, Melrose used a man's superiority with a non-Cruce Colvine trial at the end of a strong pressure moment.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw yellow card to make a plaza to Climo without a ball, from the sanation line, MacPherson noted an anti-trusion against the penetrant of the Ayr.
Climo marked, as he had done it almost since the repression, after Kyle Rowe collected a shot by David Armstrong and passed the ball to the third line at Gregor Henry to annotate the fifth trial of the local team.
Stil Game series star appears to be ready to start a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, star of Stil Game series, seems ready to go to the hostery sector after it's been discovered that he was appointed a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor, interprets the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular series of BBC, who writes and reportagonizes with Greg Hemphill, his comical couple for a long time.
Duo announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and apparently Kernan is planning his life after Craiglan.
According to official records, it's Adriftmorn Limited's director.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, even though a source of The Scottish Sun noted that Kernan intended to enter the "florrent sector" of Glasgow's restorative.
“The sea is ours: Bolivia, with no litoral, waits for the court to reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrolled through her barn covered in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a sea blue flag.
Naval bases from Titical Lake to Amazon are packed with the motto: "The sea is our right.
Getting him back is a duty."
Across the Bolivian homeland, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a conflict of grudging resources in the 19th century is still very vivid, as is the anthel to sail back across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a resolution that the International Court of Justice will emit on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and you don’t have to say it, wait with a positive posture of the result,” Roberto Calzadilla pointed out, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the TIJ resolution on large screens across the country, hoping that the Court of La Haia dictia will claim that after decades of intermittent conversation, Chile is forced to negotiate the concession of a sovereign departure at sea in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, face a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes for Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts think that it is unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia and that things will not change much.
The UN-based organism of the Netherlands has no state to promote Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of any possible conversations.
The TIJ resolution, produced only six months after the final allegations were presented, indicated that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, internationally-right specialist.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a retaliation in the last four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate pointed out.
“The belligerant rhetoric of Morales has manufactured every gesture of goodwill by Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will still talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep conversations after this episode.
The two countries don't exchange ambassadors since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz Veltz, who was a member of Bolivia in La Haia, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the court was exceptionally quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a remarkable opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile,” and an opportunity to “put an end to 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits,” he stated.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crossa.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
'Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.'
North Korea claims that nuclear disarming will not occur unless I can trust the US
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yung Ho, claims that its nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if Washington cannot be trusted.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among the leaders of the two rival countries.
Her statements arrive at a time when US State Secretary Mike Popeo appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy over three months after the summit held in Singapore with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a cheque to think that the continuous sanctions and objection of the USA to a statement that ends the War of Korea can make North Korea kneel.
Washington distrusts the statement if Pyongyang doesn't do any further major disarming movements.
The US-American President Donald Trump wants to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is a generalized skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang takes seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers only the means to ensure its safety.
Pompeo has planned to visit Pyongyang the next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris's fashioned parades reveal the last gamma of large hats, on their way to a main street near you.
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look for anymore.
Valentino designers and Thom Bowne introduced a range of extravagant hats disproported from their SS19 collection, which enshrined the style defined in the Paris Moda Week.
This summer, Instagram has been ravaged by very impractical hats, and this designer has brought his surprising creations to the gateway.
The prominent piece of Valentino was an exaggerated hat, adorned with a wide wing, with a plumper-shaped feather, flooding the head of models.
Among other overdimensioned accessories, there were enjoyed syndies, a sorcer hat, and even a pine, but these aren't designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also filed a selection of strung masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of color living, had sewed lips and looked more of Hannibal Lecter than high-statured.
One creation resembled a whole team of submarinism, with tube and glasses, while another seemed to be a cone of melting ice cream.
And if you follow the big trends of fashion, you're lucky.
The style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted on the main streets near you.
Great dimensional hats steep the "Bamba" heels, a straw hat, with two feet wide, which everyone has brought from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so practical that he scattered across social networks brought another great creation on the passover: a bag of straw for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed with a bather who wore it.
The bag of dark orange, adorned with graffiti serens and finished with a white leather handle, was the marked piece of collection SS19 Riviera de Jacchemus in Paris's Week.
The famous styleist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope to see people wearing large hats and beach bags in the main streets the next summer, considering that designer has had a huge impact, it would be a pity for large dimensions to be ignored.
John Edward: Language powers are essential to world citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued on 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is seen reinforced with individual success and collective sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools are represented by the Independent Schools Council (SCIS) who strive to provide better standard service for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for later and higher studies, for a career that they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages are still a matter of very popular choice and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak to her in her own language, you will get to her heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's tests, we can see that languages are leading the classification tables with higher grades in independent schools.
The 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the Note at the top.
The data, collected by 74 schools member of the SCIS, reflected that 72 percent of students got a qualification at the top of Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also got an A.
This shows that the independent schools of Scotland support foreign languages as vital powers that children and young people will need doubts in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, remain in the same consideration as STEM allocations (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) in study plans from independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the United Kingdom Expectment and Competences Commission revealed that the reasons for employers to make it difficult for them to cover the vacancy, in 17% attributed to the lack of language powers.
So language powers are increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for future careers.
As more and more opportunities for potential work require languages, these powers are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he has a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like that.
The fact that you can communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a survey done in 2013 by YouuGov over 4,000 U.K. adults, 75 percent of them didn't know how to keep a conversation, and French, with 15 percent of speaking, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
That's why investing in language teaching is important to children today.
Knowing various languages, especially those of developed economies, will give the best children opportunities to find an important job.
In Scotland, there are diversity between schools regarding the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on the most traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the U.K. to the future, toward 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, he'll always be able to choose between a series of independent school languages, who count specialist personnel in this area.
The independent schools are devoted to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and turn them away from the necessary powers to succeed, regardless of what the future will appear.
In the global commercial environment of the present day, languages are not denied a vital importance to the future of the country, and this needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered really “international statements.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
And they've done bien lee.
John Edward is the director of the Independent School Scots Council
LeBron will debut the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
The wait has practically ended by fans who want to see LeBron James play his first match with Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach, Luke Walton, announced that James will play on Sunday's first pretropped game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still have to determine the minutes to play.
“They will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said to the official Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a Laker journalist, tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the early training of this week, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six of the Lakers' pre-emptive parties.
"I don't need pre-empted parties in this stage of my career to be ready," he rebuilt.
Trump mining in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a campaign wave in Wheeling tonight, West Virginia.
It's the first of five programming rallys for the next week, including visits to supporters, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court's vacancy is on hold, Trump intends to support the next half-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when votes are issued in November.
At what time is Trump's rally at West Virginia tonight and how can you be seen online?
Trump rally at Wheeling, West Virginia, is programmed for 19hs today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in Virginia of the West can be seen online on the link that is then speculated through live video transmission on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump started this week with the nominated candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of sexual abuse accusations facing, while the Senate's planned confirmation vote is on wait until a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this gathering wave is to help the Republicans presented in the delicate November election to charge impulses.
Thus, the five rallys of President Trump's campaign programmed for the next week are addressed to “Incite volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and widen the majors in the Senate and the Reuters' Camera, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is as important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, at the time we are headed for a busy campaign season,” a spokesman of Trump pointed out that he refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
The rally tonight, programmed on Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could congratulate supporters of "Oio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, the state he earned for over 40 percentual points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate who's getting a disfavorable result in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him an impulse in polls,” Simon Haeder commented, a polythologist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The American Team shows its ambition to keep the hopes of heads on individual Sunday parties
After three unequal sessions, the Sabbath erasoms were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The basculating pill of dynamics is an inventive concept, in which players really believe, especially in competition like this.
So whose side is the positive dynamic now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're on a little positive scrap," Jordan Spieth declared at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve plus at stake.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind blows up a little in their favor and have lots of reasons to be cheered up, largely by the state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day together and they both have three four points.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is exampleing.
The observing gestural cries roared up intensity as he continued his vault and put in a crucial stunt to empathize the fourth party, when he and Thomas had been down two after two holes.
He celebrated the pudding party that won them in the hole 15 with a similar scream, of the kind that he believes the American team is not out of the competition yet.
“You have to try your best and worry about your own party,” Spieth noted.
It's all these players have now.
18 holes to leave print.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable feeling of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple are four of them and they don't make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the latest nine holes Friday morning.
For this result, and the way their energy seems to flow in and from public boiling, it reaffirms that it is players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinary to close a possible European victory while sunset on Le Gulf National.
Preferred to both at once in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning workings, who made a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the new holes sank the Spaniard and the Swedish into a hole they never had an option to leave.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you out of the hole.
It's very fascinating to see the interactions between the unions, the advice they give and the ones they don't give, and the way a strategy can change suddenly.
For now, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this session of erasomers has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight than some, especially in the United States, had been questioned.
Europe arrives at the end of Ryder Cup with a favorable brand of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after the workings have ended and the conditions on Saturday with a 10 to 6 victory over the United States.
The inspirate duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary made a great effort to get two victories against a hard Tiger Woods and leave his record until the moment in four points in Le Gulf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to keep the trophy that lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a poor American team on the morning handles and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. filed further resistance to erasumas and won two parties, but couldn't reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points to the 12 individual parties on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutante who gets four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known with the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensing weekend, are only the second couple to gain four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After Smlashing Woods and Patrick Reed to the eras, they ran a brilliant performance to beat up a disinflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambaeau for a 5 #4 even more emphasical.
Woods, who had been dragged into two Saturday parties, showed splendors of sporadic genius, but lost 19, 29 games on top of it and erasumers, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who didn't take part in the workings of the morning, re-assembled with Henrik Sentson to the professors and fell by 2 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third of the world, respectively.
Europe, however, didn't have all the faces on a pleasant, windy day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times champions of the tournament, and Justin Thomas established a reference point on the Americans to achieve two points.
They won a victory by 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the eras, and then came back to gain Poulter and Rory Mclroy by 4 to 3 to the eras, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history had a team lifted a difference of four points to the individual parties, even though the Furyk team, a title defender, just needs to empathize to preserve it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a Sunday counterattack is out of reach.
North Korea claims that no unilaterally "no way" will be unarmed if no sign of trust is appreciated
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs communicated on Saturday in the United Nations that the continued sanctions were intensifying his distrust in the United States, and the country would not in such circumstances eliminate unilaterally their nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said in the annual General Assembly of the world's organism that Korea had taken “many goodwill” for the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile evidence, dismantling the nuclear evidence center and committing not to make weapons and nuclear technology.
"We didn't look at any answer in the U.S. consonance," he said.
"No confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in these circumstances, we will not start unilateral disarming at all."
While Ri rebuked the well-known complaints of North Korea on Washington's resistance to a blush of unnuclearing "for phases" by which North Korea would be rewarded as she took peaceful action, her statements seemed significantly because she refused to reject unilateral unilateral disenfranchisement as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement Kim Jong One and Donald Trump made to the first summit between an American-function president and a North Korea leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim committed to working on the "Ro-Banese Peninsula," while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's safety.
North Korea has tried to end formally in the 1950-53 Korea war, but the United States said that Pyongyang has to eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the call to relax international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
“The US insists that unnuclearing should first be produced and increase pressure level with sanctions to achieve its objective coercitively, besides opposing “the final declaration of war,” Ri pointed out.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a cheque of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continuous sanctions are intensifying our mistrust."
Ri did not refer to the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the part was involved in the unnuclearing issue between South Korea instead of the United States, the unnuclearing of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this standard of stambling.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from what remained last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that pointing to the US country with North Korean missiles was inevitable after the president "Mr. Evil" called Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "struct fully" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take up measures of disarmance, but demonstrated that there is still much left to do and the sanctions must be kept until North Korea is unnucleared.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for that, and it "it doesn't matter whether it took two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia hold that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary Mike Popeo declared on Thursday to the UN Security Council that “the security sanctions application of the Security Council has to continue upbringing and without exception until we confirm total and defining malnuclearization.”
The Security Council has moved sanctions to North Korea unanimously from 2006 to a bet to cut off funding for balsitic and nuclear missile programs from Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri outside the U.S. General Assembly and then communicated that he would visit Pyongyang again in the next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang last July saying that they had made advances, but after a few hours in North Korea, he accused him of "made demands of a gangster."
At a meeting with Moon held this month, North Korea committed to dismantling a center of missiles and a nuclear complex if the United States took “survival in consonance.”
He said Kim had said that the "supports in conconsonance" he was looking for were the security measures that Trump promised Singapore, in addition to normalization of the relationships with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a course on rest-Habetitudes
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat culture, increasingly widespread, to study overnight, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic found that students at a university number one of the world’s students are often deprived of what goes on to basic aspects of how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a Son medical professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he thinks is the first of his species in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact that sleep deprivation had in learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, "Why are you telling me now, all this in my last year?"
He said that nobody had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he reported in The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, the basic concepts of how good hasitudes of sleep improve academic and sports performance, as well as general well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of Psychia at Harvard Medical School and director of health care services at the university, stated that the university decided to enter the course after learning that some students were suffering a serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, within an hour of duration, includes an interactive task series.
In a section is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, drums and books to retrieve information about the effects of coffee and light, about how it affects sporting performance in sleep, and how important it is to keep a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how sleep deprivation in the long term can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily path.
“We know that the conduct of the students will not immediately change.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler pointed out.
The culture of pride of staying awake all night still exists, he said, and he added that modern technology and growing pressures that students suffer from sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Make sure that a good quality sleep would have to be a "secret weapon" of students to deal with stress, turmoil and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, because the deprivation of sleep puts his brain in starvation mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student and Physic Biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, after attending one of his classes for his first year at Harvard.
Raymond remarked that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to promote the course on the campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask graduate students to perform a similar study program before incorporate to the institutional competition.
Professor Czeiser recommended that the students take into account the fact of putting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they are aware of the damaging effects of the "green light" that emit the electronic screens and LED lights, that can alter the ciradian haul and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 -0 Rangers: Menga Gol ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's gol condemns Steven Gerrard's disgusting team to a defeat for 1-0 in Livingston's house that poses another bump outside.
The Ibrex joint sought to add its first home victory since last February 4 through St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team drifting, 8 points from the Hearts, unstoppable Ladbrikes Premiership.
Menga noted the gol seven minutes before the half-minute, and never seemed to have the Rangers, lack of inspiration, be about to equal the marker.
While the Rangers now falls in the sixth square, Livngston rises in the third place, behind Hiberniran by difference of gols.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, because the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object that apparently got thrown from the graduary.
Gerard made eight changes to the alignment that swept the Ayr in the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same 11 headline that plucked a spot against the Hearts last week, probably felt satisfied by the way their team, well-organized, squashed their rivals all the time.
If the Rangers mastered possession, Livingston made more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have marked the two minutes of party, when Menga's first intervention left alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the half-camper swathed and wasted by the great occasion.
A lack of seizure from Keaghan Jacobs came across Captain Craig Halkett, but his defenseless partner Alan Lithgow only made a shot down on the back of the pole.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game at the third end.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penal in the sign of the 15 minutes, since he and Steven Lawless came across, but Steven Thomson's refusal ignored the colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two shots to take the first part, but the first porter of the Ibrex, Liam Kelly, had no problem with the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the Docter Avie Ejaria.
While Livi’s first act of Livi’s day could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only by their own efforts.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with Jacobs' working move.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his calm to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard paused to change Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and the change had an almost immediate impact, as the extreme made a pass on Moreloss, even though the imponent Kelly rushed to the lock.
However, the Livingston continued to catch the attention of visitors playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halket stepping past them, one after another.
But McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow gave a deprived shot from the canner.
The replacement of the Glenn Middleton Rangers still called for a last criminal for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made his big eyes.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a "Sunday Morning" page: September 30, 1882, 186 years ago, and counting... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that finally gave birth to the device we know as "Giger Counter."
Geiger counter, which is a pillar of science since then became a pile of pop culture, as the film of 1950 "Balls of Coronado", protagonized by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, some seemingly failed physicists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emitted the minerals' radioactivity."
Evans: "You're sure it's blowing up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the inventor that keeps his name alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach immune system to "see" and remove evil cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize is evil cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab
You can "see" a common protein in many cancers and then reinject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different kinds of cancers.
A woman deals with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the evil cells, she watched the ovarian cancer suffer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab to "see" a protein present in many kinds of cancer (HER2) and then injecting them again.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute for Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A.: "The resulting ones we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The protein HER2 "approves the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorful, told Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach that consistently extracts immune cells from patients and teach these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked on the treatment of a kind of leukemia.
Kanye West seized a pro-Trump on a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL program.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was called in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance congratulated by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said it would be presented in the elections of 2020.
After his third song of the night, Ghosttown, on which he wore a head of Make America Great Again, began to criticize Democrats and to reiterate his Trump support.
"Although I talk to white people tell me, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," she said.
The SNL program started with a parody of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate Judicial Committee for the complaints of sexual assaulting by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't issued, the comedian Chris Rock uploaded the film of West's disapproval on social media.
It has not been clear if Rock intended to ridicule West by publishing.
However, West has complained to the public that it was not well treated among scensors because of the cap he was wearing.
"I was threatened by scensors.
They told me not to date that hat on.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," said the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Would you like to see the bottom position?" while he said he would put Superman's cloak so they wouldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to advance?
Try to love."
His comments provoked the public's crisp at least twice, and members of the show team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, who had a reporter explaining in the post, "The whole study was completely mutated."
West took himself as the last hour replacement for Ariana Grande, the ex, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left a good part of the audience perplexed with the interpretation of the song I Love it, disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the head support of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits:
But the host of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "sirly the one who is and is absolutely wonderful."
"But I've chosen not to reward someone (comparing their music or clothes or supporting their "art") that I think adopts and spreads a ideology that hurts my community.
He's free.
And so did we," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that his name was changed and that he was now "to be known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist named himself, and he follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Peddy.
His raped colleague, Snoop Dogg, formerly called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of the Prince music, changed his name for a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.
Intriguing murder act as a stab wound at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man's stabbing in the east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident has taken place in Ballyhack amorie.
The defendant is expected to appear in front of the first court court in Belfast on Monday.
The D.A. will check the charges.
The star of thrones, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of the Legal swordsman Jon Snow's role in the violent fantasy series of HBO throne games.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the virial hero stereotype, claiming that such roles suggest that young men often think they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said that "something had gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to the pythrotagonist of throne game, Rose Leslie, has already admitted that he is being strongly determined to deal with this problem.
"Personally, I wonder where we've been wrong about maleity," he said.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem that we are experiencing now?"
According to Kit, television can have a part in increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its virile characters.
He added, "What is innate and what is acquired?
What's being taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this virility face?
I think it's one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because surely something is wrong with young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do a prequel or sequel of thrones when the end of the series is planned for the next summer, saying he's sick of battles and horses.
From November, Kit will stagnize a reposition of Sam Shephard's Trueest work, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his fiance Rose is the best thing he has ever given him throne game.
"I met my wife in the show, so she gave me my future family and my life forward," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character representing Kit, Jon Snow, in the series of fantasy winning an Emmy.
The couple fought marriage in June 2018 in Leslie’s family farm in Scotland.
HlV/sida: China Notifys a increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced a major increase in 14 percent in the number of people living in HlV and with sida.
There are over 820,000 people who are affected in the country, according to healthcare.
Only the second trimester in 2018 declared 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are sexual transmission, unlike old-fashioned events.
Traditionally, HlV was fast propagating in some regions of China because of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who hire HlV for this cause has been reduced almost to zero according to statements by Chinese healthcare agents in a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HlV and Aid in China has increased 100,000 people.
The transmission of HlV by sexually is a serious problem for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination from the LGBT collective is common.
With the country's conservative values in mind, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who maintain homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to the lack of sexual precautions.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HlV medication as part of an effort to cope with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a employee has leaked data from the Republican Party's Senators and dismantled "denty" and "conspiracy theories."
US representative Maxine Waters denounced accusations by which a member of his staff published personal information from three U.S. republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
L.A.'s democrat claimed demands were driven by critics and websites on the far right.
"Lieness, lies and more despicable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
Supposedly, the information published contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information appeared online on Thursday and published it by someone unknown to the Capitol during a session of the Senate commission on sexual abuse reports against Supreme Court Nomination Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was filtered after three Senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the literature was linked to the Waters office and that it revealed information about a member of Waters staff, reported the Capitol.
"This baseless denunciation is completely false and a pure lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, identity, personal data, and the security that has been compromised due to these fake and fraudulent reports, was not responsible for any way of this leaking information.
This baseless denunciation is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated criticism, including the former White House press crime, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," Fleischer wrote.
"That makes you think he doesn't have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they haven't done, they don't have to be angry.
No need to show defiantness.
You don't have to question the charger's motives.
You must keep calm and serenator."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's critics, whom critics accused of seeming too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was introduced to overthrow Waters in the election of half-legislature, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Important if true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We'll make sure that the offenders were revealed, and continued, and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions they've performed, and that they've harmed every single member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again: Round Atkinson's limited spy parody
It is already traditional to search for references in the Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and that reposition of the franchise of Johnny English action parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is not an exception.
This humouristic self-satisfiedness of how we are of despicable will be a new opportunity to export the country?
In any case, the incompetent of outdoors and rubber Johnny English's face has been able to renew his license for trouble everything, and his name indicates more than anything that is a comic book creation designed for non-English speaking territories with tradition of going to the cinema.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, in spite of his pretentions of liquid glamour, has a bit of Clamourau, a Mr. Bean point and a touch of this guy who holds a single note on the matter of firefall at the inaugural ceremony in London 2012's Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the international traveler and mysterious Atkinson that represented the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where chaos was planting everywhere.
There's one or two good times this last JE trip.
I loved Johnny English that he was approaching a helicopter wearing medieval armor and helice leaves replicated to his helmet.
He sees the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems quite loose and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious filmmakers" like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems destined for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as mutute gags of the character Mr. Bean representing Atkinson.
The premise repeatedly is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An IT pirate has infiltrated the British super-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the dismay of the service agent, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the latest resource for a prime minister who is a pretensive, harassed figure, who already has a total collapse of political lack of popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of her own with this caulster of Teresa-May, but the script doesn't reach any more.
His intelligence counselors report that as every active spy is endangered, he has to retrieve some retirement from him.
And that includes Johnny English, now employed as a professor in some luxury institution, but imparting extra officers about how to become a coverd agent, with some good gags, like when English provides a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his weekly Bough squash, paper to represent Ben Miller again.
Now Bough is a married man, bound to the commander of a submarine, a zealous role, where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin when things get really ugly in Her Majesty's secret service they're coming into action again and they find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "famous" Ophelia Bulloltova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister drops dangerously under the spell of the technology bilionary cartoonist who claims he can solve the IT problems of Britain: the Jason Volta siminister, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hatred for ridiculous bogeries: disguised as waiters, set fire a French food restaurant, scattered chaos smuggling the iot from Volta and English's luxury yacht causes a big confusion in trying to use a virtual realization helmet to familiarize themselves with the inside of the Volta's house.
All stops have certainly extracted from this latest sequence, but with all the simplicity and the noise it presents, it all looks like a child program.
Pretty normal things.
As with Johnny English's other films, it wasn't helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role to do justice to his talent.
Labour Party denies her idea of a plan for the British to have a four-day job week, covering five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a radical plan for which the British work four days a week and charge five.
Suspectively, the party wants business heads to pass their savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IAIA) to employ workers with a more party day.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would receive the same wage.
According to sources, the idea would fit the economic agenda of parties and plans to bend the country in favour of the workers.
The change in a week will work for four days with the support of the union Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experimented source of the Labour Party declared at The Sunday Times: "It is expected to be announced to be a review of the politics before the year ends.
It won't be the night of the day, but a week of four days is an aspiration which fits the perspective of the match to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day job week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration together today.
According to a spokesman from the Labour Party, "A four-day work week is not a party policy and the party is not considering him."
The Ministry in the shade John McDonnell used the last week's party conference to detailed his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell manifested his determination to reestablish the power of the "anonomy directors" and "supporters" in public service companies.
Minister's plans in the shadow also involve the shareholders of water companies who may not recover the whole investment, as the Labour government could apply "dections" for the crimes it perceives.
He's also confirmed plans to place workers in business meetings and create inclusive property funds to hand over 10% of the stocks of the private sector employees' firms, who are hoping to pack annual divides for a value of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation might change their minds.
The fbi investigation of all accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, and he raised the question about whether the agency's discovery could influence any Republican Senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview published on Sunday, the correspondent of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could get anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy was wider than his South Carolina colleague.
"I pray seriously," said Kennedy.
"In the session I said I had talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the accusations went public, and I asked him if he did.
It was firm, certain and certain."
But Graham's vote seems to be burned to fire.
"I have my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I would present an explosive accusation," affirmed.
"Dra Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett roundly denied it," "Afgigine Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people who name it will be able to verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see it changing anything new."
What is Global Citizen Festival, doing anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host Global Citizen Festival on Saturday, an annual musical event, which presents a program of absolutely impressive stars, who perform a mission equally impressive: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition this year, Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands gathered in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken the awareness of the global event to end with extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project extension, a group of international defenses that hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help to combat it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (at least someone wants to pay a VIP entry), the attendees would have to do a series of tasks or "actions), like volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, make a phone call or any other activity to awaken consciousness about ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizens now that he has 12 years behind him to reach his goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand an action call or just one more case than we call "click on" (such as you think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?)
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million actions of its sympathizers who have helped to reach various goals.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and equipment to more than 37 billion USD people, which will have influenced more than 2.250 million people before 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and ads derived from their actions, which have already deemed or gathered at least 10,000 USDs.
The group estimates that the protected funds have now exercised a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the The Power of Nutrition founding, an organization of investors and fans with it in the UK, committed to "helping children to grow as much as possible" and promising to send Ruanda 35 million USDs to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens' members, like you, we can convert the social injustice of malnutrition into a foot page in history,” said The Power of Nutrition, TraceyEllman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions that were asking the UK for better nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach five million women and children for nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the P+F websites asking "what makes you think we can end up with extreme poverty?"
Global Citzen said, "It's going to be a long, hard way.
But like big civil rights defense movements and against previous apartheid, we're going to win, because together we're stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janele Monáe are some of the artists who will take action at this year's event in New York, who will present Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use Marina as a "blocking" to obstruct Russian Power Exports (Interior Service)
Washington can, "if necessary" travel to the navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting the markets, including the Middle East, has revealed the US Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examine.
Zinke has reported that Russia's intervention in Syria, primarily where it operates in a legitimate government invitation, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think that the reason that they're in the Middle East is their will to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
According to the officer, there are ways and ways to deal with this issue.
"The United States have the capacity, along with the navy, to ensure that seafoods are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent their energy from entering the market," he declared.
Zinke addressed attendees to the event celebrated by Consumerce Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that self-defines as “the energy consumer” in the U.S.A.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are actually equal.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to seize and replace fuel," he said, as he indicated that Russia only has a resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Declares come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to advance the export of its natural gas in Europe, in the substitution of Russia, the most economic option for the European consumers.
To this end, Trump Administration officers, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the North Stream 2 "inappropriate" project, which said Trump, turned Berlin into "capitive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Streem 2, which has cost 11, billion USD and will double the capacity of the gasoduct existing to 11 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition in the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of disloyal competition.
I think we share the opinion that energy cannot be a tool for pressuring and consumers have to be able to pick the suppliers, declared the Ministry of Energy of Aleeksandr Newk after a meeting with the secretary of the United States Department Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US posture has led to a negative response from Germany, reaffirming its commitment to the project.
The main organization in Germany’s sector, FDI (Federation of Brotherman Industries), has appealed the U.S. to remove the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state is interfering in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI, after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he's going to "think closely" his presidency candidate on 2020.
The senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that he would "think carefully" his presidency for the presidency after the election of half-legislature.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidate.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government fracture, for the women to take high charge," said The Hill.
After November 6, I'm going to take my candidate seriously to President.
Warren intervened about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was "carrying the country the wrong way."
"I am frankly worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank on his reviews at Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election."
However, a poll that was published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters thought it shouldn't be presented for 2020.
About fifty-eight percent of the "probable" electors of Massachusetts have said that senator should not present, according to Suffolk University Research Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-five percent would support the candidate.
The survey revealed larger support for the former Manufacturer Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a possible candidate and 48 percent against it.
Other profile names among the Democrats who took into account a possible candidate for 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator by Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd reveal his decision officially in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cits the EEPT Track Palin's rally in Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) happened a year in Iraq after hosting September 11, 2007
Monday night he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident
"With what's going on my own son since he returned, I can understand other families who suffer TEPT rations and some of the emotional wounds that our soldiers return with," told the audience at a Tulsa Donald Trump rally, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war vets: "trained a little bit differently, then hardened back, wondering if there are respect for what his fellow soldiers and pilots and, as well as any other member of the army, have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence by a woman, with a statement by domestic violence and weapons tineration under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla PD.
18 States and DC Supports the challenge of a new asylum policy
Colombia's National and Columbian Divuits Support a new U.S. policy to deny asylum to victims running away from gangs or domestic violence
Representatives of 18 states and the district filed a friend named curiae in Washington to support an asylum-seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the demand for the case Grace vs Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties filed last August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and the children of the violent gang" assaulted him, but American officials denied his asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, in which a large number of asylum-seekers in the US, as in countries facing generalized issues of gangs and domestic violence.
New US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals, allowing undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
The Columbia District General Karl Racine stated on Friday that the new policy "ignore decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal law requires that asylum demands harm according to the events and private circumstances of demand, and this prohibition infringement this principle, according to the healing of friends.
Law lawyers also argued that the policy denying the entry of immigrants harming the economy in the United States, since it is more likely to become business and "proportionary jobs".
In June, the Attorney General Jeff Session ordered the immigration judges not to give more asylum to victims running away from domestic violence and gangs.
“The asylum is available for those people who leave their country on persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular political group,” Sassion said to his ad on June 11, 2013.
The asylum has never sought to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious ones, who are facing every day around the world.
Desperate efforts at Palace as human losses multiply into a sprint to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is getting more desperate.
"The atmosphere is very tense," said the 35-year-old Risa Kusuma mother as she calmed her son with fever in an evacuation center in the city destroyed from Palau.
"Eat minute, an ambulance has bodies.
There's no drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed houses to catch flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of wounded, and hospitals, cursed by the magnitude sism 7.5, are all overdated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, have fractured their shoulders, are outside the Palu military hospital, as patients are being treated outside because of the strong shakes that repeat.
The tears denied her eyes as she explained how the violent earthquake shook the room of the fifth hotel where she was with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," explained Haris to Associated Press, and added that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then I heard her no more.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The US ambassador accused China of harassing " propaganda announcements".
A week after an official Chinese post published a four-page commercial in an American newspaper promoting the profits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump went on Wednesday to pay for China Daily in The Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa State, after accused China of immissing himself in the elections at the U.S. Congress of November 6, U.S.S.S., accusing China to deny.
Trump’s prosecution that Beijing was trying to immiscise himself in the U.S. election marked what American officials have told Reuters about a new phase in Washington's campaign to intensify pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to insert ads to promote trade, Beijing, and Washington are currently taken into a commercial war that is entailing and who has seen rise to arzeals in mutual care.
China's vengeful anchels at the beginning of the commercial war were meant to punish state exports, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador in China and former Iowa for a long time, a major agricultural exporter in China, affirmed that Beijing had hurt the workers, farmers and U.S. companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: “It’s redoubling the harassment of propaganda ads published in our free press.”
"In divulging their propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of freedom of expression and the free press to insert a pay commercial in The Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
“But the kiosk on the street down here in Beijing, you will find few discrepant voices and you will see no real reflection of the opinions that Chinese citizens can have on China's worrying economic trajectory, since the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers dodged the bill" on his post, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans take away women's voters before the election of half-legislature with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn the analysts
As many of the leading Republicans support and defend the candidate of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which faces several demands for sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the next election of legislature.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans have officially shown that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," explained Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, in The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last minute pressures of Senator Jeff Flak (R-Arizona) to take out an FBI investigation are enough to calm down the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday, not tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and spokesperson of the MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington's newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the Protesters shouted "november is coming!" as they manifested in the Senate lobby while the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be out of the graph," Stu Rothenberg explained, an independent political analyst in the news site.
"People say they've been up already; it's true.
But they could have been more, especially among the voters of women from suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who often don't vote while they don't like the president.”
Even before the public witness of Ford, where he detailed his demands for sexual assault on the Supreme Court, analysts suggest that a negative response could be produced if Republicans pressured with confirmation.
"This has become a mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, ex-president of the National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not only about the vote of the board or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh sits on the bank of the accused, but it also has to do with how Republicans have handled this issue and how they treated it to it,” said Guy Cecil, director of USA Prioritias, a group that helps vote Democrats, to the news channel.
But Americans seem to be divided amongst those who believe in Ford's stela and the witnesses of Kavanaugh with the scale that is slightly inclined to the last one.
A new survey by YouuGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in both doubtless and likely the witness of Ford, while 35 percent claim to be inductable or likely Kavanaugh.
Moreover, a 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or indubtable during his witness, while about 30 percent claimed that Ford himself.
After Flake pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the demands that are in charge of Ford and, at least, another reporter, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez denounces that the Supreme Court candidate showed him the genitals at a party while studying at Yale the 80s.
The World Wide Web Inventor Planning to Create New Internet to Competit With Google and Facebook · Global Voices
Tim Berners-Lee, the website's inventor is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid Platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee congratulated that the Inrupt intention was "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," said the company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid Platform technology to allow users to create their own "Personal Online Data Store" or a POD.
It can contain lists of contacts, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in a browser at the same time.
What is exclusive from the personal online data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it “improved power through the data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to the business administrator, John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and aptitudes that are suitable for the Solid platform to be available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
Since this week, technology developers from all over the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that no one from her team is talking to "Fancebook and Google about whether to enter a radical change where all business models get emptied completely in the night.
"We are not asking for permission."
In a Saturday post on the Media, Berners-Lee wrote that the "Inrupt delivery is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated in the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it founded the World Wide Web Consortium in the Institute for Technology of Massachusetts.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice to the online neutrality debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the site," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the cleric of the I GM Victorical Cross
The only church cleric in England who won a Victoria cross during the World War I as a combatant has been borne in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van got the keeper on September 29, 1918 by the attack on Bellenglise and Lehacurt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he'd won the most important British military honor.
Their two grandsons uncovered a memorial tombstone on a parade on Sabbath in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said he was "symbolically symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's proservation.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion by the Saint-Quentin Canal Canal Canyon "through a very thick mist and under the strong cannon fire and machine guns".
Later he rushed to the line of fire and, with the "Valiant maxima" moved the row before throwing himself over a single cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the highlight.
The lieutenant colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a prose that he could never equal, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, directed by the Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a real hero is demonstrated by support that he will receive many people.
MMA's fans who ran out of sleep all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you stay up all night to see Bellator 206 and deny you to see the most important event.
The banner in San José contained 13 battles, including six of the main card, and had to be seen live all night in the U.K. in Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gigard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, U.K. viewers were astounded when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were upset about spending the night awake until dawn to see the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the change for cartoons as "a kind of vomiting joke."
"The government regulation says that at 6:00 this content is not suitable, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of marketing and marketing, when asked him about broadcasting.
"Bring the little pig, yeah."
The president of the Bellator company, Scott Coker, said they'd work in programming to include U.K. viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there are 6am a Sunday morning and we can't solve it till Sunday at our hour, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed my channel, there were a lot of messages coming and coming, and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to figure it out, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six of how we normally do, we tried to show it again for the followers, but it's over.
It's a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'improved' about sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to other people because of their sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't notice until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
At the Desert Island Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, said he talked about gay rights to give people hope.
He also said that being a parent had remained reluctant to win the Olympics.
The usual presentor of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has taken several months of low disease.
Daley, who appeared as a nauphage in Laverne's first program, said she felt "less that" other people because "it wasn't socially acceptable like children and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me power and strength to succeed."
I wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when he discovered his sexuality.
The two times winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile of LGBT movement, and has used its image the games of the Commonwealth in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without branching, and he wanted to give people hope.
The world's tricampion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American writer, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "made me in amazement."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 greater than him, but says the old difference was never a problem.
According to him, when you are young, he participated in his early Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later — it is hard to find someone he's experienced high and low.
The couple were parents in June of a child whose name was Robert Ray Black-Daley, according to Daley, "all their perspectives" has changed.
"If you'd asked me this last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," she said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of a brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he should die and one of the last things he asked was if they had the tickets for London 2012 already, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "dad, you wouldn't be there to occupy the first row," he said.
"Which I would hold his hand, he stopped breathing and was not till then, he was already dead, that I finally agreed it was not invincible," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jump in front of a crowd at home in the Olympics -- there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song, which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympic Games and still put on his hens' skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 a Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worsened Mickelson was introduced to Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record Sunday by playing his 47th Party of Ryder Cup, but he'll have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to turn into an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to beat a record for 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for the "furballs" and "furs" of Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as has been commonly for the United States, the winner of five major tornes spends his time between making cheerers and working in his game in the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He's never done the most direct drivers, not even at the very moment of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Gulf National, where the long rouge tends to punish the deviant blows.
And if his own trajectory isn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth Sunday party, he's going to be facing the accurate champion of Open Britannica, Francesco Molinari, who joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If Americans, four points down to the start of the 12 individual parties, they start strong, the game of Mickelson could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say a lot more.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, made me a palm on his back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me he'd be ready the next day," said Fryk.
"It has great confidence in itself.
It's a hall of fame and it's taken a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we should move forward.
He wants to be there, just like any other."
On Sunday, Mickelson will get over Nick Faldo's record the maximum number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a career at Ryder Cup that hasn't equaled her individual record.
Mickelson got 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven ties, although Furyk said his presence has brought intangible to the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, pranky, likes to mock people and it's a great fellow for the team," she explained.
"I think the younger players would also have fun getting into it this week, which has been fun to see.
She's carrying a lot more aside from her game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon fade.
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that starting with considerable advantages for individual duels of Ryder Cup's last day can be easily turned into a hard day.
The Dane debuted in 1997 to Valderra, when the team captained by Seve Balteros had a five-point advantage of the American team, but at the end they won the victory for the minimum, 14,5-13.5.
"You continue to remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Vaderrama, where we won, but by little," Bjorn said on the image, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team at 5-3 every Friday, that leaves the marker at 10-6 in Le Gulf National.
History has taught me and all of the team members that are not finished yet.
We have to go to full power tomorrow.
You have to go out and do everything right.
That's not over until the dots don't go into the marker.
We have a goal, trying to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I've already told you, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have to remind you who our rivals are, the best players in the world are."
Enchanted with the performance of their players in an demanding golf field, Bjorn added: "I will never rush on this.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual performance will make the difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything's okay, but the individual duels test your ability to play golf as best.
That's the message you have to transmit to the players, get the best of you tomorrow.
At that moment, you leave your partner and he has to go out and also get the best of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival Captain Jim Furryk, expects his player to surrender better than in team with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, which added three four points.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the backs of the last day, as it was part of the winning team in Brookline before he finally lost his "Miracle of Medianah" to win Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw motivated, the captain of 1999, his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important parties, but we want to start with good foot, as seen in Brookline and Medianah.
When there's a team that's inspired, it creates a lot of pressure on these central showers.
We've prepared analyzing depending on the circumstances and the best way to try to magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the ride against Rory McIlroy at the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose that order because I believe it covers all possibilities," says Bjorn about his selection for individual clashes.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new German Armed frigate should have ended in 2014 to replace ancient war vessels in the Cold War era, but it won't, at least, for the year it comes from defective systems and a increase of cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Würtmberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the problems after construction have marked the term of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württenberg class vessels that Armeda commissioned in 2007 will replace the old bars of the Bremen class.
It is thought to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-virious and antibuchic missiles, as well as computer technology against angry actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other highlighted features include longer periods between maintenance: new frigates should be possible without going through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the boats of avantgarde, which it was expected that they could project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they enter up as a function, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 was news last year, when the German Armed rejected the boat and returned it to the Drassa Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Armed returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known for what was returned, but German media have cited several “respective and technical effects” of the ship that made it unservable if used on combat missions.
The technical problems are important, because about 120 sailors, half the crew needed for the ancient Bremen fragrates, operate in Baden-Wurttenberg class vessels.
Also, it has been known that the ship's weight is excessive, which reduces performance and limits the ability to add future improvements to it.
It is thought that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons will weigh the level of similar class vessels used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Apart from the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, also begins to be a problem.
It's thought that it has reached some surprising $3.100 million from the beginning budget of 2,200 million.
The problems of the new fragrates have become a matter of special importance, if they take into account the recent warnings that indicate that the maritime military power of Germany is weakening.
This year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, acknowledges that the Armed "is running out of ships to be used."
The officer has stated that the situation has declined over time because they stopped using old ships, but none of them were provided again as a replacement.
He has lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Würtmberg class could join the Armed.
National Foundation Is the Secret Life of Wats · Global Voices
A new research conducted in a farm in Scotland Highlands aimed to discover how bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
Discoveries are expected to bring new data about the behavior of only flying mammals and to help with future conservation activities.
The study of scientists of the National Scotland Foundation will continue to have soprano ratpenates and common, as well as landed northern and water-proofs in the Inverwe Gardens, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track rating activities during the station.
Voluntars and staff of the UK’s National Health Service will also make mobile probes with laptop detectors.
The analysis of the sound of expert recordings will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed image scale for the landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation adviser for the National Scotland Foundation, expects the results to show which areas of habitat are more important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the advantages of the habitat management work such as prairie creation, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the U.K. has dropped significantly in the last century.
Build and restoration of buildings threaten bats, because they affect nests and cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightening also pose a risk, just like the mattress paper and chemical treatments used in building materials, and the domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their hunting night habits, their ears are more useful than eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated location technique for eco to place insects and obstacles that stand on their flight.
The National Scotland Foundation, responsible for taking care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is taking the bats very seriously.
He has ten experts with the right formation who perform surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescues as usual.
Even the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to rattens at the Threave State Finca in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight species of batts of Scotland.
The manager of the farm, David Thompson, claims it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Threave, we have a big area for the bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we still don't know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us understand what they need to grow."
It highlights the importance of checking whether there are bats before doing property maintenance tasks, because the possible unintentional destruction of a single childhood more than 400 females and young women, which could lead to the disappearance of a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, annoy them and destroy the nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, officer of the Dressed Conservation Foundation, encouraged people to step forward to help.
He stated, "We still need to learn a lot from the bats, and in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data about their population."
Ronaldo denies the accusations of rape while her lawyers make a claim against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that all accusations of rape against him are “false news” and said that people“ want to be famous” through their name.
His lawyers will demand the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing allegations.
The head of Portugal and Juventus have been accused of violating an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a room in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Presumably, he paid at his time 375,000 dollars for the incident not to become public, according to the information published by Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a video by Instagram Live that he addressed his 142 million followers hours after allegations became public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed to be "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," says the five times winner of the Gold Ball on the camera.
"They want to become famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to leverage my name for celebrity, but it's part of my work.
I'm a happy man and it's all in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo lawyers already make the demand against Der Spiegel for accusations, who have qualified as “inadmissible information of suspicions about private life,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for “a moral damage for a matter according to the gravity of infringement, which is probably one of the most glacier in personal rights in recent years.”
The presumptuous incident occurred in June 2009 in a hotel suite, and casino Palms from Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where, presumably, he violated her anonymously, according to reports filed in the Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him it was a "99% good lad", except "1%".
The papers hold that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual intercourse, but were consented.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took pictures of his injuries to the hospital, but later accepted an outside agreement from the court because he had "poor of retaliation" and was "publicly humiliated."
The woman, 34 years old, claims she's trying to cancel the agreement, since she continues traumaticized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to take a stake for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the moment of the alleged incident and this summer has broken by Juve, the Italian giant, at an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "repent always" of losing automobile manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent--always if he lost the state of world leader in manufacturing after the Brexite, according to Greg Clark, Economic Secretary of Affairs.
He added it was "precerning" that the U.K. base declared to BBC that if the U.K. left the European Union without any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on the borders in case of a Brexit without agreement could cause losses of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which made Auris and Avensis de Toyota, produced in the last 150,000 cars, of which one 90 percent of them exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point of view is that, if the U.K. comes out of the EU without agreement at the end of March, our production will be stopped in our factory," Marvin Coole said, the director of Toyota management in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with all EU countries will work has sparked the fears of other U.K. car manufacturers such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar, and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after the Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is done on a "such as time", with pieces that arrive every 37 minutes of U.K. suppliers and the European Union for the manufacturing of cars.
If the U.K. leaves the European Union without making any agreements on March 29, there may be riots on the border, that the sector considers it could generate delays and scattered parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than one day on the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a consequence.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequer Plan for future relations with the EU is “balanced precisely to avoid these border checks.”
We want to get to an agreement. we want to get the best deal I allow, as I say, not only enjoy the current success, but also take that opportunity, has declared the Today program of BBC Radio 4.
Toyota's tests not just, but other manufacturers also indicate that we need to continue with a successful set of production chains.
Toyota was unable to confirm how long the production would stop, but in the long term, it has warned that costs added would reduce the competition of the plant and cause loss of employment.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of United The Union on the plant, said that the members begin to be very concerned about the situation: "For experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman stated: “We have designed a precise and believable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
Donald Trump's expected meeting with the general procurator Rod Rosenstein could "put up a week" as the fight continues on the nominate in the supreme court, Brett Kavanough, in statements of the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and aids at Trump and possible obstruction for President justice.
If Trump fires or not the general procurator and risks Mueller's independence, he's fed the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times now reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record his conversations with Trump and also the possibility of putting the president to the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was in the United Nations in New York City.
Trump stated that "preferiate not" would fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid confrontation with the Senate judicial committee where Kavanaugh testified and one of the women accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Friday, Trump ordered a week-old investigation into the FBI about the accusations against Kavanaugh, which led to further delay the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered: "There has not been any dates yet; it might be this week, though it may take one more week for all the issues with the supreme court.
But we'll see.I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists could refute this statement: Sanders has not made any informative session of the White House since September 10th.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the lack of informative sessions was not because he didn't like the fanfaring of television journalists, even though he said, "I'm not denying they're great fanfares."
Then he implied that he would increase direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president is making more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting a source: "We've consulted these data."
Sanders has claimed that the news sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the possibility to ask directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than to speak to me.
We try to do it often, you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and they'll replace the informative sessions when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press wheels with dignitarians on official visits.
The individual press wheels are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance, and, at some point, strange in front of the journalists gathered.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers in the Scottish Health Service due to the fears of Brexit
The health secretary has written to the EU staff who works in the Scottish Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and hopes for them to continue after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to less than six months from the EU’s U.K. exit.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of residence applications for EU citizens who work in the public services of delegated.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union on exit have continued, and it all seems headed toward the decision expected this fall.
But the U.K. government has also started preparations in case of a possible unaccounted scenario.
I know it's time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate now that I appreciate the contribution of all members of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Friends of the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and abilities that strengthen and improve the work of health care, while benefiting the patients and communities we treat.
Of course, Scotia is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christation Abercrombie subjects to an emergency operation after a crackdown on his head
Christing Abercrombie, behind the Tennessee State Tigers has been subjected to an emergency operation after a crackdown on Saturday on the defeat of 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commoators, according to Mike Organ's information in Tennessian.
The coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the press that the lesion happened shortly before the medium.
"He came on the sideline and collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen in the band before they put it in a stretcher and took it in to build more evidence.
An officer in Tennessee State reported Chris Harris, from WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt's medical center.
Harris added that there is still no information about the type or the range of injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when lesion occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, a second year, with Tennessee State after it first came from Illinois.
I had completed five boardings on Saturday before leaving the party, which made 18 this season a total.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher bell tax when buying a property in the U.K.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher bell tax when buying a property in the UK with additional money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
Growing up on the pitch tax will be recorded in those people who don't pay taxes in the UK.
The IRS hoped to get to 120 million annual pounds to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to write a higher bell tax when buying a property in the U.K. and this money will be used to help people who are homeless, a measure that Theresa May announces today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable dwellings that would affect higher incomes.
The rise in the field tax will be recorded in those people and companies who don't pay taxes in the U.K.; this money will be held at the government's action to combat homeless people's figures.
The super commission, which will be added to the current bell tax, including the highest levels entered two years ago in second homes and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
The IRS hoped to get to 120 million annual pounds.
13 percent of the new construction properties in London are estimated to be non-British residents, which increases prices and hinders new-grown buyers from opening up on the property scale.
A lot of well-story areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ponsored citizens" because of the many foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new arrangement arrives weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a reduction on the tax to help the young get their first home.
He accused the great constructs of keeping the prices of property high by quickly buying ground and not using it, and he urged May to overturn the quotas over affordable homes to correct Britain's "destruct real estate".
Corbyn announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls on rental and ending evictions "no fault".
He also wants to give the joints more power to build new homes.
May have stated the following: "The past year I said that I would dedicate my man to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be correct that it is equally easy for people not living in the U.K., as well as for businesses with foreigners to buy housing compared to hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the indignity of homeless people does everything more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
The Sunderland coach, Jack Ross, said his "an ambitious maxim" is to be the Scotland coach at some point.
The Spanish, 42, has accepted the challenge of reviving the Northerneast Club, which currently ranks the third position on the League One, at three points of the leader.
He arrived at Stadium of Light this summer after St. Mirren returned to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a gambler.
I was summoned once as a support and that's all,” Ross declared at the BBC Scotland Sportsound program.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland a lot in Hampden with my father when he was little and it always is something that makes me go back in time.
This opportunity will only come if I'm successful in training clubs, but.”
Ross Predecessors in charge of Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Dio Canio.
Alloa Athletic's coach claims he doesn't feel the pressure to be next on a list of names consecrated on such a large team, after he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswicht.
"Once, my criteria to measure my success will be if I can bring this team back to Premier League.
With the structure and the club facilities, it's obvious that his place is Premier League,” he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd just consider it successful here if I could get the club back."
Rosas is only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at the Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical body.
He helped Alloa to avoid descending in the third category and transformed St. Mirren from fighting for salvation at Championship's camps the next season.
Ross claims to be more comfortable now than during his stage as a player at Clyde, the Hartlepool, the Falkirk, at St Mirren and the Hamilton Academical.
"Probably it was a decisive moment," he remembered about accepting office at the Alloa.
"I always had believed that training was what was best given me, rather than playing.
It sounds weird because I did it right, and I went away reasonably, and I enjoyed pretty good times.
But gambling can be very hard.
There's a lot you need to do every week.
I still spend it in ways like stress and pressure from work, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've ever heard since I'm a grown man."

The perfect time for a painting is 17:30 on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heatwave has fired the consumption in Britain's hardships, but it has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have gained a increase in about 2.7% in the July sales, but consumption in restaurants has been reduced to 4,8%, according to the statistics.
Peter Martin, from the CGA financial assault, the company that collected the data, stated the following: "The continued suntimes and the participation of England in the World, which has been extended more than expected, have led to the July to follow a pattern similar to June, with the increase of 2.8% in the bars, except in the case of restaurants, who have suffered so much more.
1.8% reduction in June restaurants has declined in July.
Bars and taverns, led by drinking, got the best results, while consuming restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered in the sun, although it wasn't as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we've consulted, drink sales have increased at 6.6% over the month, while food sales have been reduced by 3%."
Paul Newman, of the entertainment analysts and RSM hotelry, said the following: "These results follow the trend we see since the end of April.
Time and impact of major social or sports events are still the main factors related to the outer entertainment market sales.
It's no surprise restaurants are still having problems, but a shifting of sales at 4,8% interanual would be particularly harmful, rather than continued pressure on cost.
This long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for trades that serve food and time will tell if the most moderate temperatures we've had in August will give such a necessary breath."
The total increase in the veins of bars and restaurants, including recently open, has been of 2.7% in July that indicates the slowing of the mark presentation.
The sales measure of the Coffer Peach Tracker sector for restaurants, bars and U.K. taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operators, combined with loss of over 9 million pounds and is the point of reference set in the sector.
One in five children has social network accounts that mask parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, has social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a poll.
A survey between 20,000 high school students has set an increase in the "Insta" pages.
News has made the fears of publishing sexual content grow
Twenty percent of the students say they have a pirial account that they show their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey between 20,000 high school students has introduced a quick increase in the "Insta" accounts, an Instagram reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
News has made the fears of publishing sexual content grow.
About 20 percent of the students claim that they have a clean "principal" account that they show to their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager in which she urged others to "violate me."
The investigation, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the directors of private schools (HMC) directors of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of teenagers between 11 and 18 have two profiles, whose half have admitted private accounts.
HMC's boss, Mike Buchanan, has declared: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."

Thanks for the moody messages!"
A tyrant commercial comparing mothers with cows divides opinion into the Internet
A sheet company has divided opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares lactant mothers with cows that milk.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "silent priller who can be taken from the world", consumer Elvie's technology company has issued an inspired announcement in a music video joke to show the freedom that gives the new pull to the mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of puddles and you go to the pace of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I join myself, but you won't see any tails," and "If you didn't notice it, it's not braguess, but my breasts."
The return continues, "Bombers, firefight, I feed babies, fire, fire, milk girls."
However, the commercial, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixture of reactions from whom it has been seen, which many claim to show the "horrs" of the lactic industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to announce the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and bear to produce milk, with the difference they're apart from their little babies a few days after birth,” one person wrote.
Tiny Elvie is discreetly hidden in a lactance bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Absolutely traumatic to the mother and the baby.
But why don't you use them to announce a tie for mothers who will keep their babies?"
Another user said, "It's an ad outside of place."
Other people defended the advertisement; a woman admitted to finding that the song was "distructed."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still got to breastfeed.
Pumbling for the roller made me feel exactly like he was a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but you have to take it as it is.
It's a great product," wrote a user.
Another person commented, "It's a funny announcement meant for mothers to pump with tyrants (usually to their place of work or toilet and feel like cows.
It is not an announcement that praises or judges the lactic industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with our sliding hands on the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they're used by tyrant.
However, the tyrant Elvie is completely silent, it has no cable or tube and fits discreetly into a lactance bra, which gives women more freedom to move, to hold babies and even out while they pump.
Ana Ballarin, a sootia and first childhood developer in Mother, declared: "The Elvie tyre is such a revolutionary product that deserves a daring and provocative campaign.
As we traversed parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the audience how a tumbler is used and the challenges we posed to do that, as we demonstrated, intertentively and dysactic, the incredible sense of freedom that the new puller offers.
This is not the first time the Tilly Elvie is on the news.
During the London fashion weekend, a mother of two children appeared on the gateway for the designer Marta Jakubowsky while using the product.
Hundreds of emigrants, silently transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of retained migrants have increased even though monthly entries have practically remained stable, partly because the hard rhetoric and political introducing by Trump administration have difficult child officials.
Traditionally, most sponsors were unpaid immigrants, who were afraid to risk their prospect of staying in the country if they decided to host a child.
The risk has increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible sponsors and adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high range officer of the immigration and custom control, testified in front of the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had requested to host minors not accompanied.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested didn't have a prior criminal record.
"On the 80 percent of the people who have taken the welcome or live in the home of a person who has taken the lead are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal strangers.
Therefore, we will continue to persecute these people,” Albence declared.
To process the children faster, the officers have introduced new rules that require some to appear to the court for a month after being held, rather than 60 days, to be the prevalent standard, according to the refugee workers.
Many of them will appear on video non-conference, rather than inmately, to defend their case to obtain the legal state in front of an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered definitive for aid will be deported from media.
The longer children spend in custody, the more likely they suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent rumps or escape attempts, according to the workers and reports they have given to know the system in recent months.
The lawyers claim that such concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that because of its size, signs are overlooked that a child is suffering.
They added that moving the kids to camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or to say good-bye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria Instructs US Employment Forces · Global Voices
Following the UN General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Waid al-Mulem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country eight years ago.
Muallem, who also acts as vice Prime Minister, has stated that foreign forces were in illegally illegal territory under the pretext for combating terrorism, and the matter will be addressed accordingly.
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the “war of terror has practically ended” in Syria, where over 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced.
He said Damascus would continue “lighting this sacred battle until we've purged the whole Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States have about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to form and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces to oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground of a country struck by war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has claimed that conditions were good for his return and has blamed "many Western countries" to spread "irrational woes" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have claimed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns," he said.
"They're polishing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for reconstruction in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition will end the war.
United Nations diplomats have claimed that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral area in the last great reliability, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with the political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has "lightministries" and has expressed hope that the military action will face thejihadists, who include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "returned."
Staffan de Misura, sent from the UN, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new government-membering committee to begin to profile a subsequent constitution in the war and prepare the way to the election.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation on the committee, whose task should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to that logic, Trump would win the election again in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, scandals and destitutation process will end with his premature premature presidency.
What it would be, surely, "the end of a most dramatic presidency in history."
At the moment, there are no sign of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of audience schedule viewers have been more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million top-time viewers, since 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show," MSNBC has led a TV audience with up to 3,5 million viewers in the main news nights.
"People have been poured out because they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series "Designed Survivore," about a cabinet decree that happens to be the president when an attack on Capitol.
Nell Scout, a comedy writer and author of "Just the Funy Parts: And at Few Hard Truths Abut Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
Remember a cab trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told him he'd vote Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said to me that because he made him laugh," said Scull.
There's an entertainment point in chaos.
Of course, unlike TV programs, the Washington-based script could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrants' families can meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find yourself at the sixth hour of watching a piece of experts discuss the use Bob Woodward of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's skin jacket ("a piece of thick clothes like his pride," titled Washington Post), and the consequences of the horrific descriptions that Stormy Daniels made, say, the Trump anatomy.
In my case, I will no longer see Super Mario.
"Part of what makes it seem to be part of a telereality program is that every night it gives you something new," says Berent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the character changes and the scripting rotations of the Trump program (beat the NFL, lloar Kim Jong-U).
You can't afford to miss any episode because you stay behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and it was sunny outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up looking at MSNBC as he recorded the CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not with Brett Kavanagagh about to face the Senate's judicial committee and the supreme court's future hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we did those crazy programs then and people said it was the beginning of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be some kind of joke, but it seems they were right."

External money floodes the races of the half-election elections in the House of Adjusted Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realization of the congressional districts that have caused two current members to compete for the same square.
This recent reassignation of the underseen district of Pittsburg implies the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who received the square in another district after a special elections last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, the Kaith Rothfus Republican, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who conflicts with the new 17th district.
The maps were rediscovered after Pennsylvania's supreme court decreed in January that the former districts were unconstitutional in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic campaign Committee for Congress (DCC) and the national Republican campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was named in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in a very busy election held in March to represent 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The Republicans have taken over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States impose sanctions on the Salvador for its support in China, but they are withdrawn
The diplomats observed that the Dominican and Panama Republic had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his associates threw out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officers decided to withdraw the heads of the American diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican and Panama Republic for the "reministic decisions about not recognizing Taiwan", declared Heather Nauert, spokesman of the department this month.
However, it only contemplated the possibility of sanction El Salvador, who received help from the United States of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, to control the drug, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions in emese visas, would be daunting for the US country and the elevated death figures for murder and unemployment.
Following the internal gatherings, officers of both countries postponed a high-level meeting of security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar encounter last year and to be seen as a step forward to prevent emigrants from heading to the United States.
But toward September, high-range officials of the administration clarified that they wanted the meeting to be produced, which actually ended up in any probability of healthcare for the Savior.
Vice President Mike Pence has been elected for the meeting, programmed now for the middle of October, as a sign of the importance of the administration, according to diplomatics.
The three American posts were discreetly returned to their charges of Salvador, Panama, and Dominican Republic without hard messages and sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate that the three officers described, including two diplomats, who agreed to debate the internal deliberations from the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymity, corroborated his statements.
Studies History
The next event in life could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump's obstruction of Justice, of which there are numerous evidences in public records.
As far as it's known, Mueller also researched whether the Trump campaign contributed Russia to his attack on elections.
If Congress switches hands, Trump could find himself giving up accounts to the organism, just as he prepares to do so in front of the voters, and even in front of a party jury.
These are numerous circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, nor any of its European homonys, is inevitable.
There are choices that must be made to both of the Atlantic shores that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a coup against Hitler, only if the Western block had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and we lost our chance to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of story fluctuates about tipping points like this and is accelerated or the unexorable progress of democracy is taking place.
The U.S. faces several tips currently.
What happens if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Proportor, the man who controls the fate of the investigation on Mueller?
Rosenstein has been with water on his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly filming the president and speculated that it was not suitable for the charge.
Rosenstein claims that the Times information is not accurate.
"How will we answer whether the new research that the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or whether it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite the credible accusations of sexual and false abuse?
And, especially, are we going to vote halfway through a Congress that will hold Trump responsible?
If we don't get past these trials, democracy will start to jeopardize.
But I don't think we're gonna fail, because I already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Czechian deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, he emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the savatic.
With that baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, Optimistic of Face-Against Vienna Rapid · Global Voices
The Rangers receives the Vienna Thursday Rapid, aware that a victory against Austrians, after an impressive draw in the Vila-real field this month, would leave it in a good position to rank the G group from the League of Europe.
A lesion on the knee prevented the half-fielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season to the empath 2-2 against the Vila-real, but he thinks the Rangers can use this outcome as a trampoline for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team," said the player, 31 years old.
"We played the thought party that we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten something more at the end, but, in general, probably, the tie was a fair result.
They were better at the first half, but we were better than they were in the second.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it's going to be a tough match because they got a good result in the last party, but I'm sure we're going to give it everything and get a good result with the support of the hobby.
Last year was really hard, with the lesions I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is fine and the guys enjoy it, training is good.
I hope we can give it all up, leave the season behind and succeed."
Women lose sleep over fear of retirement savings
Although participants in the poll had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of each other, few people talked about it with their family.
Nearly half of national surveys say they spoke to their partner on the long-term attention cost.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of "a severe earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palace on Friday, according to authorities.
Since communications are cut, the relief units could not obtain information from Donggala's regency, an area north of Palace nearest to the 7th magnitude quake epicent.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people have evacuated after disaster.
Below are some important data about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebs:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located on the end of a narrow Bay on the western shore of the Celebes Island with a beloved population of 379,800 people in 2017.

Federal attorneys calling for an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the New York City terrorist attack
The federal prosecutors in New York are calling the death penalty for Sayfulto Saipov, the suspect of the New York bomber attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary punishment that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, presumably used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a West Side Highway carrile, the Lower Manhattan, and run down villagers and cyclists during his trajectory in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors have to show that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" occasioned severe personal wounds, in order to call on the death penalty presented in the South New York district.
Both crimes could be a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a major federal jury attacked Saipov with a written of charges with 22 falts including eight accusations of murder in behalf of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in cases of mafia, as well as a felony of violence and destruction of vehicles at engines.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required a "best planning and premeditation" and described the way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfulto Habibulaevic Saipov injured wounds, damage, and losses to families and friends in Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cléves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Ariel Erlij, Heran Feruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Aljaran Pagnuco", according to the warning of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentina tourists.
It's been a decade since the last time the South New York district led to trial a death penalty case.
The demanding, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted for conspiracy to perform espionage actions for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, native Uzbekistan, did not repent in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that he told researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the mouth of accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked that the ISIS flag be unfolded in his hospital room.
Unconscious charge of 22 faults has been declared.
David Patton, one of the public defenders who represented Saipov, stated that they were “obviously disappointed” in the decision of the accusation.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty, instead of accepting a statement of guilt and a lifeless chain of freedom will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Member of the conservative party's parliament claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today in a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader has stated that politicians should "sentify the pressure of the euroscopic" when one of the members of Theresa May have suggested that it should lead negotiations with the EU.
The conservative MP Peter Bone said at the march of Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be out of the EU if Mr. Farage was the secretary of Berexit.
But the challenge facing Lady May in the time of reconciling her deep divided ranks has been highlighted when conservatives for the union have presented themselves in another protest against the Brexit in La City.
The Prime Minister is fighting to preserve his Chequers' commitment plan between the attacks of the Brexit supporters, union supporters and the EU.
Allies insist that it will reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure the euroscopics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the Leans Leans Leave Solihul rally that he wanted to undo the Chekers engagement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of the Lords and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he would have been in charge, we'd be out now,' he said.
The member of the Wellingborough parliament added, "I will defend the Brexite, but we must undo the Chequers commitment."
To precise his opposition to the EU, he added: “We didn’t fight world wars to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestions that claimed public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed in mind and wants to remain completely false."
The conservative participant of the Brexit Andrea Jennyns also attended the march and said in front of the reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, that people are listening."
"The Chekers' commitment is impopular between the general public, the opposition will not vote on it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people on the street who make up an election.
Leave Chequers' engagement and start listening."
In a message directed to Mrs. May, he added, "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said the rally politicians should hear the pressure if they want to betray the decision made in 2016 referendum.
"That, now, is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray the Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message to the excited crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray the Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us victory with the Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-sufficient UK."
Meanwhile, the union supporters took a march for Birmingham before they celebrated a two-hour rally in downtown.
A small number of activists agitated banners about conservatives against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
The conservative member of the House of Lord Adonis laughed at the conservative security issues they suffered with a boarding party application at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary TI systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus plus plus plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete sham.
There is no option for a good Brexite," he added.
Warren is planning to examine the possibility of being presented as a presidential candidate
US senator Elizabeth Warren says he's going to examine the possibility of presenting himself as a president after November election.
The Globe Boston reports that Saturday the democrat of Massachusetts spoke about his future at an open meeting at the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular President Donald Trump critic, is presented to his reelection in November against the state of GOP Geoff Diehl, who was the president of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It's been a spotlight on the possibility of rereading Trump in 2020.
The late Saturday event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the open meeting format since Trump took his position.
An assistant asked if she was planning to appear as a presidency candidate.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome.
A person arrested for Sims' deaths, LSU's dead
The Baton Rouge Police, La, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for death by the basketball player of LSU Wayde Sims Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced Dyteon Simpson's arrest, 20 years old at the ET conference of 11:00.
They published a video of the shooting Friday and requested cooperation to identify the man from the machine.
Sixty-nine-year-old Sims got a shot and died near the campus of Southern University in Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head that finally killed him," said the Murphy J. Paul on the media on 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got a shot from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to having been at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and had shot Wayde sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken to custody in the East Baton district police department.
Sims, a 2-M junior junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32-parts with 10 starts during the last season and had an average of 17,4 minutes, 56 points and 2.9 bouncets per game.
Russia's Great Prize: Lewis Hamilton achieves the world's title after the team's orders gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas remained ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play a role in his career.
From the polling station Bottas, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position at the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into boxing earlier and left Hamilton running with traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at boxing and come out after Vetel, but Hamilton moved forward after some rolling action which caused the Ferrari pilot to abandon the free interior part with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen began in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first round he went in the seventh position on his 21st birthday day.
Next, he continued in a large part of the career, since he kept his wheels to save time, moved to Kimi Raikkonen, and passed to the fourth position.
He finally entered the boxes in the 44th vault, but he couldn't increase the rhythm at the next eight rounds, and Raikkonen was placed in fourth position.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real lord to let me through.
The team did a fantastic job for a one-do" said Hamilton.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at the Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday to insist that she did not leak Christine Ford's letter to which the candidate in Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual abuse.
In a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony of Ford in front of the Senate Judicial Committee, he commented that what was happening in the Senate proved that people are "tolentes, brutal and liars".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's going on in the Senate the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry, evil, cruel, and lying people," she said.
"When you look at the statements and the leaks and they say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Do you remember your answer... did you filter the document?
No, no.
I didn't leak it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked -- no, we didn't leak it," he added while copying the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing the statements against Kavanagagh from Ford in July and was filtered in September, but Feinstein denied the release from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, as he asked me."
But his denial did not please the president, who commented at the Saturday meeting: "You know what, his body language was terrible.
It may not have, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following his defense of the Supreme Court’s defense, charged with inadequate sexual conduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purpose.
"They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who's hurt, who they have to hit to have power and control," said the President, Media.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer marked two valleys for Giants Against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's defeat on Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back five to three in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two-way advantage thanks to Patrick Dwyer's namings and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundees, then two gols of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season on Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who came to win the Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast Friday.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams and the Giants had won the three previous parties.
The first gol came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from a Kendall McFaull assistance, four minutes later, assisting David Rutherford, Beauvilier would double his advantage.
During this initial period, Sullivan relocated the home team at a minute 13:10 before Matt Marrdt set the equalizer on minute 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants in the first pause when he got the second gol of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped, and again Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined with helping Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the match at the end of the second part and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth gol near the end of the party.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five parties, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next Friday game.
An air traffic driver dies from saving hundreds of passengers from an earthquake plane
An airstrike driver from Indonesia has become a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a huge earthquake sacked the island of Cleebs Friday and triggered a tsunami.
So a lot of mirrors are going into the area, and there are a lot of people trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But while his companions escaped to save their lives Anthony Gunawan Agung, 21, he refused to leave his place in the trembling tower of control of the Palace-Six Alfri Airport airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure that Batik 6321 flight, who was on the track at the time, could take the flight safe.
Then he left the air traffic tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian's ABC News.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter came to Palu.
"This has broken our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigating agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Botong are limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the rubble and many still have not been accessed,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves, with a height up to six meters, have devaged Palu, who will celebrate a common Sunday funeral.
Armed forces and some commercial planes are carrying help and groceries.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Six minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Potable water is scarce.
All minimercats have been plundered."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works on clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu Sunday and told the Armed Forces: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" the CNN communicated.
Indonsia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Accident of aviation in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the pond accident.
The airline that was operating a flight that was going to crash into a Pacific lake in Micronesia now says a man is missing, although they previously said that 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the plane that collapsed.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday they did not find a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers trying to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the islands plane.
Authorities reported Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident is still unknown and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the US Navy claimed that the plane hailed in the pond because the clue was short.
Eyewitnesses think the plane crashed.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going really low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said himself and other passengers managed to walk in water through the waist until the emergency exits of the plane were falling apart.
He said the flight assistants had panicked and started screaming, and he suffered a slight head wound.
The US Marina said that the sailors who had worked nearby to improve a dock also helped with an inflatable boat to transport the people who were hit on the ground before the plane flooded about 30 feet into the water.
The data from Aviation Safety Network indicates that 1111 people have been killed in PNG-recorded airlines, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a timeline from the night a woman was burned alive
The D.A. concludes the case on Saturday's review of a man's trial accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at Justice Paul Rowlett's Department testified for hours as a witness to the intelligence analysis field.
He described the jury how he used cell phone records to build the accused's moves, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chammers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones that showed Tillis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his earlier statements, as reported by The Clark Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that day was not in town.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, since his truck was in Nashville."
Another incoherence was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that they had only been known for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis removed text messages, phone calls and contact information.
"He erased her from her life," said Hale.
The defense has planned to start its final Sunday arguments.
The judge said he was waiting for the trial to happen at the jury along the same day.
The High Breed: What's the conscious hiphop?
A triple of hip hop fills his music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of gender.
The High Breed of Bristol ensures that the hip hop is away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get back in fashion with the conscious hip hop.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have lived a recent resurgence in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Maider of NY demands a couple for good-byes after a "racist" message
A New York babysitter reported a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a bad text message from the mother protested because she was "a black person."
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with an extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay to see that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOO OO WHE A NEGRA PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After she realized her phifia, an "unconmode" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse who had fired, had been afro-American, had done his work and that she expected a Philipine person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a payment corresponding to her day of work and then sent her home with a Umber.
Now, Maurice is demanding a compensation for retirement and demands compensation of approximately 350 USD a day for work in residue six months for which she was hired, even though there were no contracts.
"I want to show you guys that you can't do things like that," he explained on the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the statements that are racist all claiming Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable one, because they were afraid they couldn't trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife sent him something she didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," said the husband, Joel Plasco, in the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand to an "extortion," stated that his wife had two months to have a baby and that he was in a "turious situation."
"Go after something like that?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is not yet resolved and the public opinion court has been pleaded to denounce the couple on social networks and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors were afraid that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bone, according to a new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in connection with the letter, "It's hard to get to the place of someone who first reads her back.
It turns out really funny, now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had inspiration to write the children's bone book about a small teddy bone, was optimistic about rejection of the book, and he also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "awesome," after his death last year.
Describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and adds his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he wasn't a presumptuous one," he said.
"But, since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as when your son got something: you get proud, even if it's not your business.
I think he considered the Paddington success this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized the Paddington’s own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her on the phone
On landing, they took their daughter quickly to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked on her to save her life.
"Nad often called to say it was very serious and they didn't expect her to get over it," Mrs. Ednan-Laperous commented.
"Then I call to Nad and told me she'd die in the next two minutes and she had to tell him goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "You know, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll come with you soon enough.
I'll go with you.
His meds that they had given him so his body would continue to be baptized were consuming and getting out of his system.
He had died before what he was expecting, and so everything went out.
I just had to sit and wait, for I knew what was going on.
I could not scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family members and more people.
I had to keep the good shapes."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now grieving for the loss of his daughter, embarked on the plane with the other passengers, distracted from the experience he was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"He had a head bow and tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a sense of sympathy to Nad overwhelming Nad.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I wanted her very much."
Leaning women hang card to prevent suicide from a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspired messages and phone numbers that citizens can call to receive attendance.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when she started suffering a depression and, at the age of 18, she was killed.
"I don't want any father or mother to hear what I have to hear every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, residue in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile could light up any room."
But he gave up his job before he died because he was in a very dark dott.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after his own life had been taken away.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am worried as long as there's a collateral effect."
Mrs. Davis made the cards 'cause people know that there are people you can come up with, who can hear, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent; you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Daves, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"Never said it was right or that it was depressed or anything like it," she said.
"A couple days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He touched deep on Christmas day, when the children opened his gifts and he didn't look at them in the eyes or anything."
He said his death would be a great trauma for them, but they have to work on it, "Open a hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future holds on a thread while the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked--a matter with a limited scope and time," said Mr. Flake on Saturday; also added that the committee would be destroyed with the root point of death by supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to do with the moment.
It's only five weeks before the election of half the November 6.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call senators and press them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and he also knew his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as it was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI creates his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republican and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the meal and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea deserters "cau" with Kim
The number of North Korea deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un reached power seven years ago, according to a legislator in South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Unification Ministry, said 1,127 deserts had been produced last year compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase of prices for people to charge had been the main factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made a public comment.
Usually, most North deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul sources say that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of Korea war in 1953.
Most escape across China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the dismilitarized area (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China regards illegal migration deserters, rather than refugees, and often repatriated them by force.
The relationships between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have greatly improved in recent months.
In the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries gathered in Pyongyang to maintain conversations centered on the denuclearing negotiations.
This happened after the historic June meeting between the President of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they remembered in general terms of working to achieve a nuclear-free peninsula of Korea.
But Saturday, North Korea's external affairs minister Ri Yong blamed the US sanctions of lack of progress since.
"No confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the U.S. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "histeric" and he's not fit to work at the High Court.
The leader of the House Nancy Pelosi minority said the candidate at Superior Brett Kavanaugh court is a "hysteurity" and that its temperates the incapacitation to work at the High Court.
Potosian made these comments in a Saturday interview in Texas Tribune Festival, held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have told her she'd be a "historical," said Pelosis in relation to her reaction to Kavanagugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, refused accusations of sexually abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and running out of words while talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats of the committee and said the accusations against him posed a "Grotesque and coordination of a character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Polosis said that Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that he could not work in the High Court because he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think it has disqualified himself with these statements and the way the Clintons and Democrats attacked," he said.
He showed reticence when asked if he would try to impeach Kavanaugh's election, if confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say, "if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only capable to be in the High Court, but not in the court where you are now," remarked Pelosis.
Currently, Kavanaugh exercises as a judge in the appeal court for the Columbian District Circuit.
Peloshi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh made against Affordable Care Act or Roe versus Wade, as it is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he dodged questions about whether to cancel certain decisions in the High Court.
"It is not time for a hysterical person to go into court and expect it to look wonderful," said Pelosis.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified ditrib--months and years of plenty of anger and can't get it out of tears.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon.
He went on... "It helped me a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere he told me that I was also crying when I was angry, but that he developed a tactic that consisted of, when I was angry and started crying, telling the person I was talking to, "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then I continued.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed as a part to anger, because basically they misinterpret.
One of the most clear memories I have of one of my first jobs in a office with most males, where I once ended up crying with indescribable rage, is one of a higher woman (a cold directive who had always terrorized me a little) who seized my neck and dragged me to the eye of the staircase.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy, because they'll get you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Colorado Democrat, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital adventure in a boat called Monkey Buss and retired from the career, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason for not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she said to me as she laughed 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone said, "Blancano and the seven dwarves."
She was late for the campaign, so she was delayed with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't access the career if she didn't raise 2 million USDs.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters, who were giving them 1,000 USDs, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When he spoke his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (thankful for the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money, and in order to guide the voters, rather than the delegates, and the rage, and the sexism) who remained out of words.

How the commercial war between the US and China can benefit Pekin
The initial savings of the trade war between the U.S. and China were deafening, and although the war doesn't seem to end soon, a distance of the countries can be beneficial for Pekin in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning to the principles of this year, when he imposed taxes to China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminum.
The most significant staircase was this week, with new aranzels affecting value of 20 billion USD products, and these two are an imposition of taxes over half of all the goods coming to America from China.
Pekin has fought every time in the same way and recently uploaded five to 10 percent of 60,000 USD goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the United States, and it is not likely that the second largest economy in the world is going back in time.
Making Washington step back, it is hard to yield to some demands, but publicly bend in front of the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Pekin plays his letters well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Pekin could create conditions that start a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than witnesses had planned,” Abigail Grace says, associated researcher focusing on Asia in the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "prepared" for refugees to be returned, according to the Minister of Outer Asteritors.
Syria says it is prepared to return refugees and demands help to rebuild the country, devastated by a more-seven-year-old war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Asteritors Wade al-Moualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
"Actually, the situation on the street is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress that has been made in combat against terrorism," she said.
The government continues to rehab the areas that the terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions are met for the return volunteering of refugees in the country who had to leave behind because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and maintenance.
The UE estimates that more than 55 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime thanks any aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept parole or support from the countries that funded the urgency.
Europe's team wins Ryder Cup in Paris · Global Voices
The selection of Europe has achieved the 2018 Ryder Cup to defeat the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the National Gulf, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times on European ground, and they don't win Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European choice once again won the crown, when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's arrived at 14,5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during the most part of the tournament, threw the water out into the hole at 3-16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinary sparkled all its series and became one of the four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was cut off with a 5."4 by the less qualified European team player Thorbjorrn Oleen from Denmark.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the greatest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 career points.
"I don't always cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a really hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so glad I got your drink back.
The team is the most important thing... and I'm glad I could help," remarked an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He puts the emboss on his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single Sunday competition.
"I'm incredibly proud of earning Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," Rahm said, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four parties in France, and now he has a career record at Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistician for one of the finest players ever lived with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklas.
American selection fought all weekend for the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-rate golf during the entire tournament.
The American captain Jim Furryk spoke after his frustrating team performance: "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
It's been a moment this morning that we've pressed the European team.
We fought.
I take my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been his captain.
There's to get your hat out.
They defeated us."
