We knocked on the door for five minutes, but it was in vain.
They had to amputate Tom's arm.

She went by my side pretending I didn't know her.
He lost all the money he had.
He painted the blue door.
He tried to drain the orange.
It was great, I went to Kyoto.
He was negligent on his part to leave the door without closing in key when she left.

He came home three hours later.
He comes here every five days.

Come anytime.
Come anytime.

Do you want to play tennis with us?
Would you like to have another cup of tea?
You want a beer?
He wants a watch like yours.
He wants a watch like yours.
You're taller than her.
You need it.
You don't have to eat it.
I want to go to America someday.
I want to learn Esperanto.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I want to stay here.
I want a book.
I want to see the ocean.
I want to live in a quiet city with a pure air.
