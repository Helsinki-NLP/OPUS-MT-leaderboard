Members of Whale's Assembly are deeply concerned about 'being viewed as a clown'.
Some even propose to rename their position to MWPs.
This raise follows a plan to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly who were on the political side were concerned that this could lead to cynicism.
One labor union member said his group had concerns that "this name would go in line with the terms Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: in Wales, twp means silly, and pwp means antiquities.
A member of the Assembly, Plaid, said the whole group was "disliked" and offered alternatives.
As well, Welsh conservatives said his group was "very open" about this name change, but thought this was only a short turn from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced similar to the letter u in English of Yorkshire.
The Commission, which is currently drafting a law on the change of name, said: "The final decision on the indictment of the nomination of any member of the Assembly will certainly affect all members."
According to the Welsh Government's 2017 law, it gave power to the Assembly of Wales in a change of name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on this issue, which was widely supported in calling it the Parliament of Wales.
In terms of the titles of members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the names of members of the Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but at the same time, the MWP was more supported by the public than it was in public consultations.
Members of the Assembly also have other options, but getting a unanimous vote will become even more headaches for Elin Jones, who presided over the meeting, and is expected to file a draft law on this change within the next few weeks.
The reforms will include other changes to the working style of the Assembly, disqualification rules, and design of the Board of Directors.
Members of the Assembly will receive final voting, which will determine the subject of the question: What should they be anonymous in the discussion about this law?
Macdonaldians vote referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday to vote on whether the country should be renamed "Republic of North Macedonia".
This populace was held to provide solutions to a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greek countries with their own state, Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the names of the northern neighboring countries indicate the territory of the country, and there has been ongoing objection to offering benefits for being a member of the EU and NATO.
Gjorge Ivanov, the president of Macedon, disagreed with the referendum on the change of name, and said he would also ignore the vote.
However, a group of referendum supporters, including Zoran Zaev, the Prime Minister, argued that this change of name was worth attending to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent. Churches in Harlem are facing difficulties.
"The old people I talked to told me that there were bars and churches everywhere in the past," said Mr. Adams.
"Nowadays, there's no more."
He said that the disappearance of the bar was understandable.
"People socialize in a different way than before," he said.
"The bar is no longer a local living room where people will go on a daily routine."
For the church, he was concerned that the money from the sale of assets might not keep them as long as the leaders expected, "Soon they'll go back to where they belonged."
He added that the church was replaced by a condominium apartment building filled with people who weren't helping to preserve the rest of the neighborhood.
"Most of the people who come to buy those condos are white," he said, "this is a factor that accelerates the closure of these churches, because people who move into the condos will never become members of them."
Originally, these two churches were built by the white community. Before Harlem became a black metropolis - the metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church was built a decade later.
The original Methadone community, which was white, moved out in the 1930s.
the Presbyterian Church
The black community took over St. Martin’s Church under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, leader of the boycott of the 125th Street retailer, Harlem’s main shopping street, who opposed or did not promote black employment.
In 1939, a massive fire destroyed the church. When Father Johnson’s disciples planned to rebuild the church, a series of bells were also built.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Rev. Johnson and successor of St. Martin’s Church, is proud to refer to this set of bells as “the bell of the poor.”
Experts who came to play the bell set in July refer to the bell set in another way: "cultural treasures" and "unprecedented historical instruments."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first set of bells in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger set of bells 18 years ago at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church had never replaced him afterwards.
What happened to St. Martin’s Church in the past months is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of which came through the induction of local church leaders, others by suggestion from the Sanctuary of Kings.
Sub-district Council - which consists of local leaders - wrote to Sangkamol with concerns that Sangkamol would "find a way to throw the expenses" to the Sangkamol Council, although the Sangkamol Council did not involve hiring these architects and contractors sent by Sangkamol.
Some students complained that Sankamol lacked transparency.
Sharks attack a 13-year-old while diving for lobsters in California.
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy Saturday, while he was diving for a lobster in California at the lobster season opening event, officials said.
This disaster happened before 7 a.m. near the Beacon beach at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the baby's whistle begging for help, he swam in groups to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that the sound was an excitement that caught the lobster, but then he "thought to realize it was a screaming, 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
Hammel said that when he reached the boy's body, he saw the boy's clavicle ripped open entirely."
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel recalled further.
A boy was transported to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported to have been severely ill.
No one knows what kind of shark this time child abuse is.
Captain Lifeguard Larry Giles said to reporters, roughly, that a few weeks ago, a shark was seen in the area, but not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim was also injured in the upper body area.
After that, the beach was closed from Ponto Beach at Casablad to Swami's at Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not endangered.
Sainsbury's has a plan to push himself into the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury’s will replace Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in a department store style, with assistants who are experts in consulting.
Driven by a concrete pattern to enter the 2.8-million-pound UK beauty market, the sales of fashion and home appliances continue to grow. As the sales fall, this massive beauty shop will experiment with 11 stores across the country and will add more stores next year if the scheme is successful.
Beauty investments are on the rise. Department stores are looking for a way to use floor space to replace items that once were TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its beauty product offerings, with over 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for its first presentation.
L’Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees share more of the brand’s area, as well as those found in stores such as Boots.
On the side of the supermarket, the boutique make-up is reopened to make most of the products health-friendly - which is what new shoppers want.
At the same time, Fragrance Shop retailers will experiment with two concessions from Sainsbury’s. The first one opened in Croydon, south London last week, and the second one opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and changing consumer behavior towards small daily shopping at more convenience stores suggest that supermarkets need to find ways for more consumers to use their services.
Sainsbury’s top executive, Mike Coupe, said the outlets are becoming more and more like a shopping mall, as supermarkets in the same chain are trying to compete with shops that sell items at a lower price than usual, like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury’s has put Argos outlets in over a hundred stores, and has also presented a number of spaces since the purchase of both chains two years ago. Saisbury’s says it supports higher grocery sales and makes the acquisition more profitable.
Previously, the supermarket had tried to improve its beauty and medicine department, but ultimately failed.
Sainsbury’s had a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but this bond ended after it failed to agree on the revenue share generated by the supermarket.
So a new strategy emerged after Sainsbury’s sold 281 pharmacy stores to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
Sainsbury's said Lloyds will also participate in this plan by adding luxury brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to all four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s trade director, said: “We have rebranded the shop’s look and atmosphere to add a positive feeling to our customers.
In addition, we support our staffs to provide good advice.
In addition to our brands designed to suit every need, we also have a convenient location in a charming and energetic environment. That means we will be the focal point and the challenge of modern shopping in beauty."
Peter Jones, 'very angry' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million joint-venture business.
Peter Jones, an actress in the film Dragons Den, has fallen into anger after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from his £11 million lifestyle brand business and instead focuses on her new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for home appliances and accessories under their Truly brand.
Both of their businesses have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter, This Morning, has announced on her Instagram that she is about to resign.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the actor of Dragons Den, with anger by withdrawing from the last second of the profitable lifestyle brand business – and focusing on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "very angry" when the golden minute girl of the TV channel admitted at a stressful meeting Tuesday at the headquarters in his business empire at Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contract- worth up to £1.5 million - which means she will no longer have time for their home appliances and Truly brand accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop, which had sales fall, and has doubled Willoughby’s estimated 11 million pounds sales.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she would quit Truly Jones, he immediately flew from England to one of his villas.
One source said: "Truly was once the top priority of Holly.
Because that's her long-term future, which she can see to be able to take her further than two decades.
Your withdrawal decision will surely shock all involved.
No one believed this was going to happen last Tuesday because the opening day was almost over.
the Marlow Headquarters
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning presenter, one of Britain’s most successful light stars, will cost the business millions of dollars due to heavy investments in goods, from cushions, candlesticks to clothing and clothing, and potential delays in launches.
And that also means long-lasting friendship ends.
The mother of three children Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin had been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined by holding the presidency in March.
The two families used to go on vacation together, and Jones also had a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is the brand ambassador for M&S and will be the host of Ant McPartlin's I'm A Celebrity Show on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We can't comment on this."
And we fell in love with each other.
He made jokes about the criticisms he received from the press in giving a comment that some might feel "no presidentiality" and a very positive outlook on North Korean leadership.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said it in a "newspaper" voice.
"We didn't give up anything."
He noticed that Kim was interested in meeting for the second time after his first meeting in Singapore in June, where Trump praised North Korea for its nuclear denuclearization.
But negotiations on nuclear weapons depletion stopped.
North Korean high-ranking officials Ri Yong Ho said to world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly Saturday that North Korea had not received any "related responses" from the U.S. to the movement to disarm North Korea earlier.
But on the other hand, he noticed that the United States still allowed constant pressure.
But Trump still had an optimistic view of his negotiations at the time.
"We're going pretty well with North Korea," he said.
"We were originally going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
But now we have a very good relationship."
He said his efforts to connect with Kim brought positive results - rocket tests ceased, helping the hostages and the remaining American soldiers get home.
And he argued about his unusual attitude when asked about his relationship with Kim:
"It's easy to use as a president, but instead of getting 10,000 people out there to concentrate in here, we can just put 200 people here," Trump said, and pointed to the crowd standing in front of him.
The tsunami and the Indonesian earthquake killed hundreds of people.
Earthquake in Lombok. For example, foreign private organizations were told that they were unwanted.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population must evacuate, there is no press conference on domestic disasters. International assistance is urgently needed.
"In many cases, which, unfortunately, they are so clear that they don't need foreign aid, it's a huge challenge," she said.
While Save the Children gathers in a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign officials will be able to land.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Assistance Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to allow foreign agencies to assist.
Despite the ongoing earthquake, Indonesia is still unable to cope with natural anger.
While a temporary shelter for tsunami disaster was built at Aceh, it is not visible on another coast.
Although there was a tsunami warning, apparently a lack of sirens warning the tsunami at Palu affected the loss of life.
And in the normal time, travelling between islands in Indonesia is already challenging.
Natural disasters make transportation even more difficult.
A nursing boat that will normally land in Lombok to heal the injured from the earthquake. It must first come to service at Palu, but to travel to the scene of this new disaster it will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo raised the issue of improving Indonesia’s infrastructure as a primary campaign for his campaign, and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
The lack of funds then made Mr Joko's administration difficult to settle, since next year he will have to enter the re-election session.
Mr Joko also faced pressure from the delayed work of the party members in Indonesia, whose members were mostly Muslim, and remained of the old-fashioned faith.
More than 1,000 people have died, and hundreds of thousands have been evacuated from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs are killing each other on the streets, with basket knives, bows and other deadly weapons.

"I saw Kante coming, so I touched once and didn't think much, just shot."
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the second half of the season after Eden Hazard, the star of Belgian side, scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue Lion Front kicks the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before the ball spins near the midfielder and runs into half of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly sends-and-go to the midfielder.
He then quickly sent a beautiful ball through to Hazard, bringing it to the Goal.
Hazard rushed faster than the defenders and ended up kicking a shot with a left leg crossing through Liverpool's Alisson Becker into the goal.
Liverpool will compete against Napoli at Group A level at the Champions League at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet Videoton in UEFA Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
Reports of Indonesian earthquake and tsunami deaths have risen to 832, the National Disaster Agency said Sunday morning.
Many people are reported to be trapped in the stone brick remains of buildings that collapsed from a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and are followed by a 20-meter-high wave. On Friday, a spokesperson for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu with a population of more than 380,000 people has become a city full of debris of collapsed buildings.

The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament has become a hit-and-run story now about "writing a new history."
Being exiled is a justice in his Taliban destruction poetry, which is considered a cultural and religious invention of Britain carried out by his strict followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, referred to Mr. Crick's proposal as "being foolish" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "Of course the goal of this debate is to move the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside of the Palace of Westminster.
The destruction of the British civil war's image was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the alleged Cromwell sacrificed himself for what Thomas' ancestors had done in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s beautiful description of Cromwell is a 19th-century evidencing and part of the history of historical individuals that people still believe to be worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Perhaps people who remember Cromwell in terms of defending Parliament against external pressure, in this case, certainly mean that royalty may have been much more than this late 19th century than today.
All of which are authentically accurate presentations or not, are historical topics that must be debated further.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has caused the development of the nation as we see it today, and Cromwell is a reminder of a person who represents a part of that segregation.
His success as Lord Protector is therefore worth celebrating and monumental."
A pig killer crushes Chinese farmers to death.
According to local news, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China.
The man, known simply as his surname "Yuan", was found to have a broken artery lying in a pile of blood near a pig lounge in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province. The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
This pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in Xining, Qinghai, China on May 30, 2005.
According to the news, he traveled to Yunnan, a neighboring county with his cousin to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and found the adjacent pig's lounge door open.
He said there was blood in his mouth.
According to news reports, the legal evidence confirmed that this 550-pound pig had crushed this farmer to death.
"My cousin's leg is full of blood and spills," said a cousin whose surname is Wu, according to Guiyang Evening News.
Evidence from surveillance shows that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found one hour later.
The pig that killed this man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent further attack while waiting for police to gather evidence on the scene.
According to the news, the Yuan family is negotiating with the market executive about his death compensation.
Although the death toll of pigs is very small, it has been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a young woman with her husband at their farm in Massachusetts. It turned out that the husband's man had serious injuries.
And ten years ago, there was a 650-pound pig holding a Welsh farmer with his tracker until his wife came out and threatened and chased him.
Then, after one Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could be "a stimulant".
"They're just pranks.
They're biters, curious, they're not meant to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them properly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's tail brings heavy rainfall to the southwestern part of the U.S. thoroughly.
According to the prediction, Hurricane Rosa was weakening after blowing through the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to the north of Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa has a wind gust that passes at a speed of 85 miles per hour as a Category 1 hurricane at a time on Sunday, hitting 5 of the east coast's time, and is at 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
At the same time, the winds formed over the Pacific Ocean and moved east to the west coast of the United States, when Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday, as a tropical storm, it began to carry thicker tropical moisture into the northwestern United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rainfall into all parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity interacts with the winds in the near future, causing heavy rains throughout the southwest region in the next few days.
Locally, one to four inches of rain will cause the danger of sudden flooding, debris floating, and possibly landslides in the desert.
The densely covered tropical humidity causes rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour at various locations, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is estimated that rainfall across the southwest region will be as much as 2-4 inches, but there will be more in Arizona.
With scattered thunderstorms, rapid floods can be intensified.
I warn people not to travel barefoot into the desert with heavy rainfall.
A severe rainfall can cause deep valleys to become rushing rivers and thunderstorms, causing strong winds and dust.
This approaching windstorm will bring heavy rainfall in the region of the southern coast of California.
More than half an inch of rain can cause small floating debris and slippery roads.
This is expected to be the first precipitation of the rainy season in the region.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sundays and Monday mornings before the rains spread during Mondays and Tuesdays.
The heavy rains will spread to Four Corners during Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The October period sees dense temperatures swinging through the U.S. since the Arctic begins to cool down, but the tropics are still warm.
This occasionally brings up and down temperatures in nearby cities.
There are very good examples of different temperatures throughout the central U.S. last Sunday.
By the city with temperatures varying to almost 20 degrees, such as between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
And in the next few days, the warmth of the blunt summer will rise and spread again.
This warming starts in October, with winds spreading about 80s from the southern region to some parts of the northeast.
New York City may have temperatures up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be 10 degrees higher than normal temperatures.
Our long-term weather forecast has shown that there is a high probability that the eastern U.S. temperatures in the first half of October will be higher than usual.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony.
On Thursday, more than 20 million viewers watched the presentation of the nominee's testimony to the Brett Kavanaugh High Court with Christine Blasey Ford, from six television networks, a young woman who accused him of attempted rape in the 1980s.
While political conflicts continued, the television station changed its usual Friday program in the final seconds, due to Senator Jeff Flake's consent to the FBI conduct an investigation into the offence for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent confident that Kavanaugh rubbed her torso with drunkenness and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh confirmed with the mood at the jail that he was 100% confident that the incident did not happen.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million viewers would be watching this announcement.
The company has been waiting for an average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
But the audience cannot be counted immediately with other networks, such as PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
Then Nelson (Nielsen) would normally have trouble counting the number of viewers viewed by offices and offices.
The size of the audience is the size of the semi-finals or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, the station, held a list of comments backed by Kavanaugh's nomination, actively leading the network with an estimated audience of 5.69 million people. In listening to the verdict throughout the day, Nelson said.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had a peak of 3.1 million NBC, a peak of 2.94 million MSNBC, a peak of 2.89 million, and CNN had a peak of 2.52 million Nelson (Nielsen) said.
The attention remained high after the testimony was over.
Flake is the main character in the story that happened Friday.
After the non-violent Republican office announced a statement that he might vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught on Friday morning that he was shouting in front of protesters as he tried to take the elevator to testify with the judiciary.
CNN made a live broadcast of his footage a few minutes after he was raped.
"I stand before you now," a woman said to him.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the whole country?
"You have power while women have no power," he was told.
Flake said his agency had made a statement, and said before the elevator shut down, that he would have a lot to say to the board at the hearing.
The cable and television networks have covered the hour of live broadcasting to stream the moment the jury voted to drive Kavanaugh's nomination to vote as a full-fledged senator.
But Flex said that he would only do so when the FBI would investigate allegations related to the appointment next week, which is a request from the minority voice of the Democrats.
In some of the conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons (Democratic Sen. Chris Coons), Flex feels convinced to believe that he is "the only one who can do anything to help him."
And after talking to Coons and several senators, Flex made the decision.
Flex's selection was very powerful because it was clear that Republicans would not vote in favor of Kavanaugh without first verifying the truth.
President Trump opens the way for the FBI to conduct an investigation into allegations involving Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accused critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May criticized critics for criticizing her plan to leave the European Union as a "serious play" against Britain's future and devastating national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May traveled to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview on the front page of the same newspaper, next to her interview, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her hard on what she called the Chequers plan for Brexit by proposing that Britain and the European Union all collect taxes on each other as "very unusual."
Howde Sims was shot: Police arrested a suspect, Dyteon Simpson, in the death of a LSU player.
Police have arrested one of the suspects in a violent shooting, which is why 20-year-old Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, has died.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for murder, a second-degree offense, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Police say the confrontation between Sims and Simpson in the official video reveals that during the fight, Sims lost his glasses.
And when the police found that glasses from the scene, they found Simpson's DNA on those glasses, with CBS joining WAFB's report.
Police added that after interrogating Simpson, he gave a confession that he had fatally shot Wayde.
Advocates reported that his bailout was set at $350,000.
A preliminary report from the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office on Friday said that the cause of death was a head-to-neck gunshot wound.
The police department credited the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police homicide lab, the Southern University police, and the residents of the area to assist in the investigation, leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the district law enforcement for "intensification and pursuit of justice".
Simms (2001).
Heights 6-foot-6 grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 and a 2.6 for the rebounds in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "very upset" and "shocked" with the news of Veyde's death.
"Here's what you're going to worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcanic ash sprays into Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the neighbouring town in the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicons last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after catching a crater reaction and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the past 24 hours.
The center has witnessed many shakes and noises.
Social media images show a thin-covered ash on the windshield in neighboring cities of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the reaction at a volcanic eruption located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since the magnitude 7.1 earthquake shakes central Mexico in September 2017.
That volcano is known as "Don Goyo", which has continued to erupt since 1994.
the Catalan Separatist Movement
Six people were arrested in Barcelona Saturday after protesters in support of the Declaration of Independence clashed with anti-riot police, while thousands of people joined the march to witness the first anniversary of Catalonia’s vote on separatism.
The separatist support group covered the face with an egg-throwing mask and paint powder to police who tried to block them, causing black-eyed dust to spread in streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
The rally took place afterwards until the police needed a baton to suspend the incident.
And for hours, the supporters of the Declaration of Independence chanted "No Forgiveness, No Forgiveness" against the protesters of the Union who shouted, "Long live Spain!"
Local media reported that fourteen citizens were slightly injured by the protests and were treated to remedy.
Tensions in regions with the concept of autonomy remain high. After a year, after a referendum, Madrid thought illegal, but Catalonia's separatist supporters continued to celebrate.
There was an overwhelmingly independent voter turnout, although the result was low, with most anti-Secessionists boycotting that vote.
According to Catalonian authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voters from going to the cross-sectional election, causing serious clashes.
An independent separatist group has camped over Friday night to assist police in preventing the march.
The march continued but was forced to change course.
Narcissist Termes, a 68-year-old fireworks worker, has joined the protests for separatism against his wife, saying he feels hopeless, Catalonia will never have the opportunity to gain independence.
"Last year was the year we lived with one of our best memories.
I watched my parents cry out for joy that we can vote now, but we're stuck now," he said.
Despite a significant deal of victory, the Catalan Pro-Independence Party in December last year remained difficult to maintain this year, as many well-known leaders, if not forcing themselves to displace, were detained, awaiting trial for their role in referendum management and subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old technician, has documented the protest incident on his phone as evidence of support to the police, saying the conflict was dug by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders who had been imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would run for re-election to the European Parliament next year.
"Standing as a candidate for European elections is the best way to criticize the reversal of the values of democracy and the suppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Several men were arrested after crashing into a house.
Three men, ages 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after hitting a house several times.
This event was unveiled at Ballyngard Crescent on Thursday, Thursday, local time around 19:30.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage occurred at the fence and the building's exterior.
There was also a crossbow on fire in the car as some spots.
Menga's Ball Strike caused Livingston to defeat the Rangers to 1-0.
Gold first for Dolly Menga for Livingston's victory.
Livingston's victory stunned the Rangers under Steven Gerrard's leadership as manager of the club, Ibrox, who lost only twice in 18 games.
Bolshevik's Dolly Menga proved to be different, while Gary Holt's side moved the level up as second for Hibernian.
On Gerrard’s side, it is still hopeless to win this season’s Premiership and meet the Hearts, leading eight points next Sunday.
Before the game, the Rangers met with Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston won another six games with an excellent invasion, led by head coach Holt, but was defeated when switched to Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a chance to hit the away team.
The Holt team is running away and making great fears for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson can penetrate the opponents to the Gold front, and Alan Lithgow can help intercept Craig Halkett from reaching Gold.
The home team let the Rangers take the lead, because they know it's going to hurt the team very well.
And that's the great story of Gold in this game.
The Rangers are free kicks and Livingston launches Declan Gallagher and Robinson to intercept the Menga. At the end of the game, they can touch the bases and earn points from the central position.
At the time, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but were unable to penetrate it, and Gold Keeper Liam Kelly blocked the ball without any trouble.
This format continued to be used in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos tried to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was intercepted by the Rangers' Gold Keepers, then Allan McGregor and Lithgow switched runs through and scored from Livingston again.
Continue the game in Livingston's field with two free throws - from which Halkett replaced Glenn Middleton and again from handball.
Analysis of ‘Great Game’ from Livingston
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland Report from Tony Macaroni Arena.
Livingston’s excellent performance and results
Everyone in the team played excellently and exceeded expectations.
Both their style and play methods have completely changed since their early return and excellent credits to Holt and the team's transformation since joining them.
He's made a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was the captain of the defense team and took great control of the game, while Menga remained Connor Goldson and Joe Worrrall as the invading star.
Although the Rangers lacked previous inspiration,
They lacked leadership and were far from the level they did better in Gerrard's day.
They missed the last ball just because they opened the sidelines for the fighting team and that made the Rangers realize that they were among the fighting team ready to go to the scrum.
Erdogan is well welcomed and varied at Cologne.
Both the smile and the blue sky on Saturday (29 September) at the breakfast session of the Turkish and German leaders in Berlin.
President Erdogan’s visit to Germany aims to consolidate relations with NATO allies.
They have been discussing issues including human rights, media freedom, and Turkey's participation in the European Union.
Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a large new mosque
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons for intercepting 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but still many supporters in the vicinity were waiting for their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurdish, condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to visit the country.
The protest reflected a split for the visitors, who were regarded as some of the German Turkic heroes.
Car collision in Deptford: cyclist dies from car collision
One cyclist died from a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a very busy street in Deptford, and on the southeast side of the city, local time around 10:15.
The driver stopped the car down and the ambulance came immediately, but the cyclist's man died in the incident.
The collision occurred after a cyclist died several months ago on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said authorities were identifying the deceased to inform their relatives.
Roads and buses are closed to deviate, and drivers are notified to avoid them.
From Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in a tumultuous
"Six officers were injured in a massive, well-protected male prison," the prison official said.
The uprising took place at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire, local time around 9:30 on Sunday, and continues.
A group of Tornado specialists took over the suspension, which included eight detainees on one side of the wing.
Officers suffered minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A delegation from one prison said: "There will be a delivery of specially trained prison officers to deal with the chaos that has continued at HMP Long Lartin.
Six officers to be sent to hospital.
We don't tolerate the violence that's going on in our prisons, and it's clear that those people will be sent to the police and that means they'll be imprisoned for a long time."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor was hospitalized after being attacked by one of the detainees.
And in October last year, the riot stopper was summoned to disrupt the serious riots that the prison authorities attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa attacks Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (drought areas may benefit).
It is very rare that the depression will attack Arizona, but it will happen early next week. If the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the desert, the Southwest poses a risk to sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has begun monitoring flooding in western Arizona, to Nevada, eastern and southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City from Monday to Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to blow through Phoenix on Tuesday, which will cause rain in the late hours of Monday.
The weather agency in Phoenix saw one tweet: "Since 1950, only ten cyclones have remained tropical storms or depressions within 200 miles of Phoenix.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest model from the National Hurricane Center predicts that there will be 2 to 4 inches of rainfall. Some may be as high as 6 inches at Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, while some areas may be as high as 4 inches.
For areas at risk of sudden flooding, rain from Rosa may be a good thing as the region suffers from long droughts.
Although the floods are very worrying, this rainfall is very useful in some areas as Southwest is facing drought.
Weather.com reported that according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, about 40 percent of the area in Arizona is facing severe drought, level two."
The first hurricane will land in Baja California, Mexico's peninsula.
With Rosa still hurricane-powered on Sunday mornings, with peak storm winds at 85 miles per hour, at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit colder waters in the Pacific, weakening it.
So we expect to land in Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Heavy rainfall in some areas of Mexico poses significant flood risk.
"It is expected that a total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall from Baja California enters the northwestern part of Sonora and there is a possibility of up to 10 inches of precipitation," weather.com reported.
Rosa then turns into a tropical storm and travels across northern Mexico before turning into a depreciation storm at the border of Arizona on Tuesday morning and winds through Arizona into southern Utah at midnight on Tuesday.
"The most dangerous parts expected from Rosa or the rest are heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the Desert Southwest of the United States," from the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening acute flooding, and debris floating in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
The attack on Midsomer Norton: arresting four men who tried to kill
A three-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempting to kill a 16-year-old boy with a stab wound found in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found at the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday, local time around 04:00 BST.
He was taken to the hospital while suffering a stroke.
A 17-year-old man, along with two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man, were arrested that same night at the Radstock police area at Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked the witnesses to keep the information on the phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh's 'a torment, a lowly, anger' of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh was a vote that rejected the nobility and the radical strategy of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a campaign on a car in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh made the Democrats "afflicted with evil, anger" over the course of his term.
Kavanaugh pleaded before Parliament last Thursday, denying strongly and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he had sexually abused her ten years ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford has confirmed the allegations she filed.
The president said on Saturday, "The American people have seen Kavanaugh's intelligence, quality and courage that day.
"The vote to confirm for Kavanaugh was a vote to confirm being one of the most successful lawyers of our time and a jury with a history of best public service," he said to a supporters gathering in West Virginia.
President Kavanaugh was nominated when it came to the importance of midterm results for Republicans.
"The next five weeks will reach one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running away, but I'm running towards," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for a good candidate."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "reflect and obstruct."
The first important step in the Senate vote regarding Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday. Senior GOP leader senator told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by a tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being swept off the beach when an earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the Palu Beach Festival on Friday, when waves of up to six meters (18 feet) swept the shore at dusk and swept away a lot of people.
7.5 magnitude earthquake after tsunami shock
"While the tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach, unable to run away and become victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Indonesian relief agency, BNPB, in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not just come to the waves, but also towed trailers, homes and hit everything on land," Nugroho added. The tsunami hit the shore at 800 km/h (497 mph).
Someone climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by disaster agencies show that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges deformed and collapsed, and mosques surrounded by water.
"After shock still shakes coastal town on Saturday".
The aft shocks several more earthquakes, which can be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the Great Earthquake on Friday was about 200 times as strong as the atomic bomb at Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of the long narrow bay, may cause a tsunami expansion.
Nugroho described the damage as "devastated" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, department stores, and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the bodies were found under the rubble of the collapsed building, he added, and another 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of deaths and damages may increase along the 300 km (190 miles) coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, near the earthquake center.
Communication "was completely absent and without data," said Donggala, Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross Council said in an additional statement that officials and volunteers were headed to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
There was widespread criticism on Saturday that there were no reports of a tsunami ashore at Palu, although officials said the waves came within the time of the warning.
A shout from a man at the top of the building about a tsunami approaching people on the road below.
Within minutes, the water wall hit the shore and swept into buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the image immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami caused major power outages and caused communications around Palu to be cut off, so it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate assistance.
The military began to send cargo planes with supplies to help from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but refugees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airports are open for relief, but will remain commercially closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit a refugee center in Palu on Sunday.
The number of damages caused by Indonesian tsunami has reached 800.
It's a terrible thing.
While World Vision officials traveled from Donggala to Palu, where employees stayed temporarily at temporary lodgings safely installed at the tarpaulin courtyard in front of their offices, they went through the demolition scene all the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me he saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's awful.
Although the aid group began to actively move forward, some dismissed specialised foreign aid workers from traveling to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, foreign aid, equipment and personnel can enter the area only if disaster scenes are declared National Disaster Zones.
Which hasn't happened yet.
"It remains the only provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross (Indonesian Red Cross).
"When the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we're opening up foreign aid, but it's not in that state."
The second night after the earthquake and tsunami occurred at Palu on Friday, friends and family of the missing still hoped for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up from the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescue unit helped a young woman to leave the limestone debris she was attached to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono Koch, Indonesia's national glider team, trained for the Asian glider game that ended early this month in Indonesia and was lost.
Mr. Mandagi added that the others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a senior in the glider line, I feel terrible," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounts that after the news of the hotel’s Roa Roa crash had been transmitted to a group of gliders, he tried to send a WhatsApp message to a rival at Palu who was celebrating on the beach.
However, nonetheless, his text only appears as a gray mark, a single mark, not two blue marks.
"That means messages don't reach them," he said.
A robbery of $26,750 left an ATM at Levee, Newport.
On Friday morning, a group of robbers robbed a total of $26,750 from Brink's officers while filling in an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to the news presented by the Newport Police Department.
The driver cleared the ATM in this entertainment complex and prepared to put extra money into the cabinet. Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the news.
While he was busy, another man "runs from behind Brink's employees" and steals a bag of money prepared to be put in the container.
According to the news, several witnesses were seen on the scene, but police did not identify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
If you have further information about these individuals, please contact Newport Police Station at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West's rapper changed his name to Ye.
This change was announced on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It's officially known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for a while, and has been using it on the eighth album released in June.
This change came before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, where he would announce his new album Yandhi.
He acted instead of singer Ariana Grande who canceled the show due to "emotional effects", the show's manager said.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current name in the industry, West also said that the term had important religious meanings to him.
"I believe 'yes' is a word that has been used very often in the Bible, and in the Bible it is also meant 'you'," West said earlier this year while talking about his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So, I'm you, I'm us, all of this is us.
Start with Kanye, which means one, just Ye -- that's a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything that's us.
This album is about reflecting on who we are."
He's one of many rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was once known by many names as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year his favorite title was announced, Love and Brother Love.
One of West's colleagues, JAY-Z, used to write with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vowed not to use forces to fight civilians.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has been elected president but has not yet taken the position of Mexico, vowed not to use military force against civilians because the country is entering the 50th anniversary of a bloody operation with students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday that Tlatelolco Plaza "will not use military forces to suppress the people of Mexico."
Armed forces fired on peaceful protests at the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing more than 300 people at the time, when the movement of left-wing students spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed that he would support young Mexicans studying by providing monthly subsidy and would also open a state-free university.
He also stated that lack of employment and lack of educational opportunities turned youth into gangsters.
The U.S. should double its A.I. subsidies.
As China is very keen on artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its funding for this research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and entrepreneur who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes after all sectors of the U.S. government have announced AI without official strategies regarding AI support.
Meanwhile, China has launched its plan since last year, with China aiming to be the first AI innovation by 2030.
"Increasing AI research budgets doubles as a good start, allowing countries that are behind the U.S. to remain behind, and we expect to see big improvements in AI," Lee said.
A capital increase will double the chances for the US to achieve its next big AI success, Lee said to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishers, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most famous AI companies in China Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he tried to create an AI system that won the top-ranked player in American Othello. He was later CEO of Microsoft’s research department and chairman of Google’s China branch.
Lee thanked the technology competition held by previous governments, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when to reorganize, so that he could further consider his vision.
Researchers in the U.S. often work very hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China to pull off academic leadership, but to be a different company," Lee said.
Now, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired experts from universities to work in AI.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could help support the U.S. in AI development.
"I think the green card should be automatically issued to the AI doctor," he added.
The China's State Council announced its next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation has provided scholarships to the public in educational institutions, as well as the National Academy of Sciences and other governmental organizations that fund U.S. researchers, but their educational work is lower than that of Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which means there will be partnerships from the industrial sector with schools and universities, and the White House has already announced a form of select committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA was announced to invest the amount of 2 billion USD on an initiative called AI Next.
Recently, NSF has invested more than $100 million a year in AI research.
But at the same time, the U.S. law asking for the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence hasn't seen progress in months.
Macedonians will vote for referendum on whether or not to change the country's name.
The people of Macedonia will vote on Sunday to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia". This move will resolve the dispute over a decade-long conflict with Greece, which makes it impossible to join the European Union and NATO at the invitation.
Greece, which also has a state called Macedonia, still wants its northern neighbors to retain the same name, as a way of expressing their borders and objecting to entering NATO and the European Union.
The two governments met in June due to the new name presented. Rivals of the Patriots argued that this name change would undermine the majority of Slavic people's identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and that the sanctions campaign has raised doubts about whether the referendum will reach at least 50 percent to make the referendum effective.
The question in the referendum vote was: "Will you be a member of NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement of Greece or
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was worthwhile for Macedonia, which is one of the separate countries after the fall of Yugoslavia, if it had been part of the Council, such as the EU and NATO.
"I'm here today to voice for the future of the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union because that means a safer life for us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, at Skopje.
Although not legally binding, there are enough parliamentarians saying they will hold the vote.
The name will change, it must receive two-thirds of the vote in Parliament.
The National Coalition Commission said that there were no reports of anomalies at 1pm.
However, only 16 percent of voters voted against the 2016 parliamentary election, with 66 percent voting.
"I'm here to vote because of my children. We're in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, pro-democracy Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, voted in a referendum on changing the name of Macedonia to open a way for the country to join NATO and the European Union (European Union) in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament, 54-year-old Skopje Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, and opposition referendum candidates set up several chairs in front of the tent.
"We are ready to join NATO and the EU, but we want to join with great respect, not by being the front-line service," said Kavadarkov.
"Although we are a poor country, we have dignity.
If he doesn't want to adopt us by the Macedonian name, we can still turn to other places like China or Russia and become part of the European and Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring the desired investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most citizens are fond of it because more than 80 percent of citizens are fond of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after dropping his vote card.
He said the results of the "response" will confirm our future."
A poll conducted by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia published on Monday showed that about 30 to 43 percent of voters would vote in a referendum, which was lower than the number of voters who voted for it.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
And of those, 70 percent said they would vote, agree.
In order for a referendum to be unanimous, the number of voters must be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure in this referendum will demonstrate missing the first major political opportunity of the Western-backed government since its inauguration in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero passes through Brighton’s defenders and then hits the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent the ball through Brighton's quarterback in Manchester City's championship, making it a 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the score in the 65th minute seem incredibly simple.
Argentine striker receives the ball sent from the midfielder at the beginning of the play.
He ran through Brighton's three quarterbacks before kicking off to an outdoor pitch.
He then found himself surrounded by four green shirt players.
He rotated through one of the defenders before rushing faster to Brighton's goal edge.
He then runs through the left to find Sterling.
The English kicker ahead of the goal sends the ball back to Aguero, who uses his right foot to kick the ball across the goal by Brighton Mathew Ryan to the right of the net.
"Aguero has some problems on his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola said to reporters.
"We talked about his play in the 55th, 60th minute.
That's what happened.
We're so lucky he scored on that moment."
But it's actually Sterling that gave Sky Blues an advantage from the start of the Premier League game.
That lead score was done in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero gets the ball deep into Brighton's territory.
He passed the beautiful ball to the left to Leroy Sane.

The Sky Blues, already waiting in front, kicked the ball into the net before rolling off the field.

Scherzer Wants to Clash with Rockies
When the Nationals withdraw, it's a good opportunity.
But Scherzer, who has always been a contender, hoped to win over the Colorado Rockies in the Sunday Match, but still feared the Rockies' game-winning Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
The Rockies scored a penalty spot and defeated the Nationals with a score of 5-2 on Friday night, but were still hoping to topple in their first division.
“Although we didn’t win, at least we tasted the victories at Denver with fans and other teams with the highest level of performance I’ve had over the years.
Why wouldn't I want to compete this time?"
Nationals have not yet announced a starter game for this Sunday, but are likely to give Scherzer a breakthrough in this situation.
Scherzer, who will play his 34th game this season, will start on Thursday and return to the regular beating on Sunday.
Washington's right hand had an 18-7 score with a 2.53 ERA and a 300-stroke total of 220 2/3 rounds this season.
Trump travels to West Virginia to vote.
While the president spoke about the importance of the number of voters to the Republican Party in the midterm elections, there was an indirect reference to the events surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's choice as a high court.
"All this we do is bet in November.
The next five weeks will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big things -- I'm not just running, but I'm really running everywhere looking for the best candidates," he said.
Trump said, "Have you ever seen a group of ugly radical Democrats?
They're trying to pull power back, no matter what method it takes, you'll see their cruelty, their disgust.
They don't care who will be hurt, who will be trampled for that power and control, they'll do anything, but we won't give them."
The group of Democrats was assigned to "against and obstruct" all the way, he said.
"What you've seen in the last four days," he added, and he called the Democrats, "anger, terrible, hateful, and untrue."
He referred to a senator of the House of Commons, which, according to the National Legislative Assembly, was Dianne Feinstein, who was popularly criticized by the audience.
"Remember your answer?
Did you leak the paperwork?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one -- that's a terrible body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labor is no longer an open community.
If anyone who speaks according to his own mind comes out, it becomes unacceptable.
When momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it wasn't surprising.
After that, I was the last person on the list of Labour Parliamentarians who was told we were not welcome - all of them spoke according to their own ideas.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was born in a similar situation when she stood up against the Jewish people.
In my case, the criticism criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
And to compare it to the importance of a trusted economic policy on national security, and in Europe, it's the same problem that Jeremy disagreed with his previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Labour Conference notification on Friday stated, "We want a comprehensive and effective meeting."
For me, as a Labour Member of Parliament for eight years, the GC meeting on Friday was really so.
Sadly, today, it's not the tone of many meetings, and the political promise of "merciful, gentle, gentle" that has long been forgotten, but it's true that it hasn't happened yet.
the Labour Party and all opinions will be decided by the Party Leaders.
This happened after Jeremy took over the lead for a while, because my colleagues I thought could share a similar political picture started expecting me to turn around (U-turn) and take a position that I never thought I would accept – whether for national or EU security.
Whenever I speak - no matter what I say - it's often followed by a reproach on social media that I shouldn't be elected, a political critic of the central party, that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
But that's not just me.
I know I'm luckier than many of my colleagues because my direct comments are mostly political.
I feel proud of the professionalism and commitment of these colleagues who can face daily sexual or elitist humiliation without shame and disdain.
One of the most disappointing aspects of politics today is why blasphemy can become so common.
Jeremy Corbyn called on the Labour Party to foster a culture of tolerance, generosity,
But the reality is that we are no longer an open-minded community of opinion acceptance, with every move "without confidence" or some change of rules narrowing the party's ideas.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years, asking me to bend my head, don't say too much, and then I'll be "okay."
But that's not what made me step into this political line.
Since I joined the Department of Labor 32 years ago, ever since I was a student, there has been a spark from the government's neglect. Thatcher dropped my idea of going to school, but turned to public service for the most desirable – whether to be a local councillor or a minister.
I've never hid my politicians, even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East will be confused about my political position and the stories I disagree with the current leaders.
For those who promote Friday’s movement, all I can say is that when the country is plowing toward Brexit, our households, our businesses and our public services are damaged. I don’t understand why they are wasting their time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But there is one statement I really want to say, but not Nottingham Momentum, but who voted for me. Whether it’s a Labour member or not: I’m very proud to serve you, and I promise no threats or political advantages will stop me from doing my job that I think is your best.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament (MP) of Nottingham East.
"Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Ayr's victory".
The latter two attempts may have made the final score poorly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a victory in Tennant's Premiership.
Now, they're the top ten that no one can take down.
In the end, it’s a great defense, including taking advantage of home, and coach Peter Murchie smiles at his performance.
"We've been through the game, and we're still standing, so I deserve to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Credits for Ayr, they take advantage of it better than we do."
For the tyre at Grant Anderson’s 14th minute, Frazier Climo was sent to the forward Ayr, but with Rory Hughe’s captain from Scotland getting a yellow Warriors pass, Melrose managed to hit the tie, allowing Jason Baggot to lay the tyre.
Climo pushed Ayr up to a penalty spot before the end of the first half. He scored with a solo to put the tie at 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and with Patrick Anderson's tie from Baggot's delivery, Leeway only scored five points.
Then there was a pretty long pause due to Ruaridh Knott's leg injury, and after the start of the game, Ayr opened a quick preview with Stafford McDowall's tie by delivering Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr’s captain, was then yellowed, and Melrose scored on Bruce Colvine’s tie, ending a fierce game.
The home team came back again, and when Struan Hutchinson got hit by a yellow card by hitting Climo without a ball, MacPherson touched down from the penalty spot and allowed Ayr to hit back.
Clemo immediately passed on to the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe received a kick from David Armstrong and passed it to Gregor Henry to get the fifth tier for the home team.
Celebrities in Still Game turn to new careers in the restaurant industry
A star in Still Game, Ford Kieran turned to the service industry after he was found to be a director of a listed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star acted as Jack Jarvis on BBC's popular show, where he co-wrote and co-starred with former comedian Greg Hemphill.
Both announced that the upcoming Nine Series would be the final series of the series, and it turned out that Kiernan was planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
He refused to comment on this, although Scottish Sun-Prime sources imply that Kiernan was considering joining the "interesting restaurant business" of Glasgow.
'The sea is ours: Bolivia has no exit to the sea, hopefully the court will decide to open the route to the Pacific to again.
The naval patrol is headquartered in the Navy at La Paz.
the Blue Sea Flag
The Navy, with its base from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, adorned with the motto: "The sea is our righteous right. We have the right to the sea.
Giving back that right is a duty."
Every part of Bolivia that has no exit to the sea is a vivid memory of the coastal loss to Chile in the bloody events of the 19th century resource conflict - because it is the strong desire to steer into the Pacific Ocean again.
This is probably the highest hope in the past decade, because Bolivia is waiting for a verdict by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of discretion.
"Bolivia is moving, has a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, watches the result to come out with positive expectations," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia diplomat.
The Bolivians look forward to ICJ's verdict with large screens located across the country in hopes that the courts in The Hague will agree with Bolivia's claim that - after ten years of occasional talks - Chile is forced to negotiate to allow the exit to the sea with Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the very talented native of Bolivia - who is facing a debate on the next election - has much to do with the decision this Monday as well.
"We are very close to getting back into the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not judge Bolivia's side - but that could be changed.
The UN council, which is based in the Netherlands, has no jurisdiction to judge Chile's territory and speculates that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The ICJ's ruling comes six months after the final hearing of the debate, suggesting that the case is "uncomplicated," said Paz Zárate, Chile's international legal expert.
And to find out the cause of Bolivia farther away, it may have to go back four years.
"Problems in access to the sea have been hijacked by Bolivia's administration today," Zárate said.
The rhetoric of Morales' quarrel was detrimental to Chile's remnants, she suggests.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to keep an eye on afterwards.
Both countries have had no diplomatic exchanges since 1962.
Adeede president Eduardo Rodríguez Velzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, denied the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a special opportunity to open a new era in a relationship with Chile" and an opportunity to "end the inconsistencies of mutual interests for 139 years," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - who is still one of the most popular Latin America's presidents - has taken the issue of a political march.
"Bolivia will never give up on access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we must step beyond the past."
North Korea says the nuclear arms embargo will not exist until they can trust the U.S.
North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said that his country would never deploy nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was quoted Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly as saying:
He called the U.S. to track down the promises given at the Singapore Summit between leaders.
He commented that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to have resumed diplomatic talks on nuclear talks after a three-month meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "dream hose" that continued U.S. recognition and objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean War would lead North Korea to distrust.
Washington distrusts the end of the war until Pyongyang sees the first step towards the demilitarization.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
Pyongyang is releasing its arsenal as the only way to guarantee the country’s security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting for Kim and Trump
Paris Fashion Show Reveals New Product Caps
If you want to add a cap to your neck, or you really want sunscreen, you don't have to go somewhere else.
The Valentino and Thom Browne designers unveiled their iconic SS19 necklace hats in Paris Fashion Week.
These unlikely hats in everyday life have destroyed Instagram this summer. These designers send these sparkling inventions into the catwalks.
Valentino’s dominant piece is a wide hat, made of feather-like material, fluffing like a slug over the model’s head.
Other devices that are larger than usual are like jeweled watermelon hats, wizard hats, and even pineapple hats - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne was also revealing one bizarre mask with- and which fits perfect for Halloween court sessions.
Many colorful masks were sewn to the mouth that looked more like Hannibal Lecter's, to be the design that came out of the top-of-the-line shirt room.
There is one invention that looks like a diving device, with both diving glasses and on the surface, while the other looks like a melted cone ice cream.
And if you're still following this big fashion statement -- you're very lucky.
Stylish watchers speculate that an enormous chili hat will be available at your nearest main store.
This larger than usual hat has been hot since 'La Bomba'. We can see this two-foot wide straw hat from many, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind a hat that can’t be used in daily life that crashes through social media, creates a new invention on another catwalk - a beach bag, almost as large as the swimsuit model.
A fresh orange bag made of palm tree with palm stripes and white handles made of white leather. The most iconic piece of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The designer gave the famous Luke Armitage a statement to the FEMAIL: ‘I expect to see these big hats and beach bags arriving on the main road next summer – because designers have made such a huge impact. It is hard to overlook the need for a larger accessory than usual.’
John Edward: Language Skills Needed for Global Citizens
Scotland’s private schools have a history of academic excellence and continue in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results strengthened by individual and group achievements in sports, arts, music and other communities.
With the number of more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, representing the Council of Scottish Private Schools (SCIS), are committed to providing the best services to students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, selected careers and locations as world citizens.
As an academy that can design and implement custom school programs, we see modern language as a popular and preferred subject within the school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone else in a language he understands, that speech will go straight to his brain.
If you talk to him in his language, the words will go straight to the heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English when it comes to building relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the latest test results this year, we can see that language is more important with the highest pass rate in private schools.
68 percent of students overall, who are studying foreign languages, will receive a high A grade.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72 percent of students receive a high A in Mandarin. 72 percent learn German, 69 percent learn French, and 63 percent learn Spanish as well.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support learning foreign languages in order to strengthen the skills that children and students need in the future.
Today, language is one of the subject options, as well as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) courses in private and other schools.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission, 17 percent of employers have trouble hiring vacancies due to language skills shortages.
So language skills will be more important to prepare students for future careers.
Due to increasing opportunities for language work, these skills are important in the globalization world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, if they learn a second language, they will have a huge advantage in the future with sticky skills like this.
In order to be able to communicate directly with people from abroad will give multilingual people an advantage in their occupational autonomy.
According to a survey by YouGov of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken, and the proportion of the two digits was 15 percent.
Investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Being multilingual, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding work.
In Scotland, each school has a different language instruction.
Many schools are more focused on modern, classic languages, while others are teaching the language that seems to be most important for the UK, looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what language your child is interested in, there are still many languages to choose from in private schools.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing learning environments that help prepare children and practice the skills necessary for success regardless of the future.
And it cannot be denied at this time in a global business environment that language is still of great importance to the country's future, so this must be reflected in education.
And modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Scotland’s youth will continue to offer diverse choices and excellence.
Il faute bien le faire.
John Edward, Director of the Council of Scottish Private Schools
LeBron prepares to debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans awaiting the start of LeBron James with Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' coach, announced that James would begin playing the opening season on Sunday with the Denver Nuggets at San Diego.
But there's no indication of how long he'll play.
"It will definitely last longer than one minute and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, tweeted that James might play in limited time.
After practicing early last week, James questioned his plans for the Lakers' six-game warm-up table.
"I don't need a pre-season game to get ready for a real season," he said.
Trump’s campaign time at West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts his campaign rally tonight on his campaign car in West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five Rallyes next week, including stops in interesting places, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump aims to increase support for mid-coming elections, since the Republican Party is at risk of losing seats in Parliament when it votes in November.
When did the Trump campaign rally tonight at West Virginia start and how can you watch it online?
The Trump campaign rally in West Virginia starts at 7:00 p.m., West Virginia tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s campaign rally at West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about the Brett Kavanaugh trial this week, which was nominated for the Supreme Court, which has been accused of sexual misconduct by voting for a unconfirmed Senate vote during an FBI investigation for a week.
But the primary goal of the rally was to boost the voter base for the Republican Party in the upcoming November election.
This week's President Trump's five campaign rally targets "remove Republican volunteers and supporters to defend and increase voter bases so they can gain more seats in parliament." Reuters news
"The number of seats in parliament is the primary goal of the presidential trip to several states because it is approaching another election season," Trump's anonymous campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The campaign rally at the Wesbanco Arena tonight will be sponsored by "Ohio and Pennsylvania, including the media from Pittsburgh," West Virginia Metro News Agency reported.
This Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia in two months, a state in which they voted 40 percent higher in 2016.
Trump seeks to reinforce the voter base for Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is named to the polls.
"This is a very unpleasant sign for Morrisey that the president has to come down to boost his own voter base," said Simon Haeder, political analyst at West Virginia University, Reuters news agency.
Ryder Cup 2018: USA Teams Fight to Win Sunday Singles
After three single field sessions, four rounds Saturday afternoon was what the Ryder Cup needed.
Each shot of centrifugal force is the perfect concept for this sport, which is what golfers tend to believe, but not for this competition.
Now, what should the centrifugal be like?
"They scored six points, and now there are four, so we thought we'd better not hurry," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the game.
Of course, Europe has the advantage right now, taking 4 points and 12 shots to play.
As Speith says, for The Americans, they think they’re going pretty well and highly motivated. Not only are the play forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together throughout the day, but they also have three out of four points in both.
Spieth leads from T to Green and leads the team by making an example.
The noise got a little louder to reach his round, and had to put up an important pitch with Four-Over-Square, when both he and Thomas both used two shots.
His pups made them 15-hour wins, and they got everyone excited, believing that the American team was no less than anyone else.
"You always sink and worry with your own game," said Spieth.
Which every player is usually like this.
18 holes for victory
The only players who have scored higher than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a story in the history of the Ryder Cup.
The odd but cute pair from Europe got 4 out of 4 points and didn't miss anything.
"Moliwood" is the only pair that doesn't go through bokeh on Saturday afternoons, but they avoid bokeh on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and at hole nine on Friday mornings as well.
The energy they have in both, and the cheerleaders believe they will win on Sunday. There is no match to be closer to victory for Europe besides Fleetwood or Molinari for this game at Le Golf National.
Especially when they both play at the same time at different holes.
Europe's victory is still said, even though it's not over.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made Sergio Garcia a four-ball star hero when he paired up with Alex Noren.
The bokeh and two shots at the ninth hole caused Spaniard and Swede to take the rear.
On Sunday, everyone will be determined to finish the game.
Watch Fourball and Foursome because it's an interaction between pairs, advice that they tell each other, what they don't recommend, and how strategy changes the game dramatically.
Europe has played well in the team and has led the game unrivalled on the last day. But in the Foursome session, it showed that the USA team struggled, especially the Stateside.
"Europe leads 10-6 in Ryder Cup final day".
Europe took advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after scoring four goals on Saturday and a game against Foursome with a score of 10-6, defeating the United States.
Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari beat Tiger Woods twice with four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn from the European team continued to dominate the cup he had been defeated at Hazeltine two years ago and defeated the American team in the FA Cup Final in the morning with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. placed in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but was still unable to catch the score.
Jim Furyk's side also needed an additional eight points from a 12-match single-season game on Sunday to save the champion.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari paired up to be named "Molliwood" after winning the game on weekends, the second pair to win four points from four matches in Ryder Cup history.
They beat Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball match, then beat Woods and Bryson Dechambeau, the new American team, by a score of 5–4.
Woods, who passed the two-match overs on Saturday, had once again shown a brighter appearance, but today he lost 19 out of 29 games in the FA Cup and the FA Cup, and was in touch.
Justin Rose took a break from Fourball early in the morning, back in the match against Henrik Stenson, and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka by a score of 2&1, the world’s number one and third.
Europe hasn't had a way of sprinkling rose petals over a cool day in southwestern Paris today.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new record for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They defeated Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in a 4–1 win over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4–3 draw.
In Ryder Cup history, only two times the team can return to win in a single match despite a four-point loss, although Furyk only wants to keep the champion.
However, after coming back to the top two from the first two days, it seems that they will not be able to hit the top in Sunday's race.
North Korea declares 'no way' to unleash one weapon without being trusted.
The North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday that the United Nations is still declaring sanctions due to massive distrust in the United States, and there is no way that the country will unite nuclear weapons in such situations.
Ri Yong Ho said to the world's annual general meeting that North Korea has imposed "important measures of goodwill" in recent years, such as nuclear testing stops and missiles, demolition of nuclear testing sites, and refusing to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't get any response from the United States," he said.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will disarm only one party first."
While Ri filed a complaint from North Korea about Washington's opposition to a "reduced" approach to nuclear weapons disarmament, North Korea was rewarded with a gradual step-by-step process, his statement seems to indicate that there is no denial of unilateral nuclear weapons disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri cited a statement signed jointly by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first Summit between the President of the United States and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to carry out a "nuclear disarmament in the Korean region", while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea had officially tried to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang had to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also insisted on resisting the call to abolish North Korea's sanctions.
"The U.S. insists on providing "first nuclear disarmament" and increasing pressure to be able to achieve its objectives in an oppressive manner, and even objecting to "the declaration of end of war," Ri said.
"The idea that the sanctions will make us surrender is the idea of someone who doesn't know about us well.
The key problem is that continuous sanctions will create even more distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second Summit meeting between Kim and Trump, which U.S. leaders informed the United Nations earlier this week.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs stressed three meetings between South Korean leader Kim and Moon Jae-in, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months, and added: "If the parties in the issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, nuclear disarmament in the Korean region would not have ceased."
Still, Ri's voice was somewhat different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting North Korea's rocket to the mainland of the United States was an event after Trump called Kim a "man rocket."
In this year's UN conference, Trump, who threatened to "think devastating" for North Korea last year, praised Kim for his bravery in disarmament operations, but also said there is still much work to be done and will continue to boycott Korea until North Korea successfully disarms its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit on this: "If it takes two years, three years, five months - it's okay."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for carrying out this.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "Enforcement of sanctions by the Security Council must be carried out seriously and not cancelled until we have confirmed that nuclear weapons have been dismantled altogether and altogether."
The Security Council has unanimously supported North Korea's sanctions since 2006 to bid for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile projects.
Pompeo met with Ri outside of the summit, the United Nations General Assembly, and said he would later visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second Summit meeting.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his final trip has not been very successful.
He departed from Pyongyang last July, stating that progress had only been made by North Korea condemning his actions as such, as "the order of the Mafia" within an hour of the meeting.
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month that it would carry out the demolition of missiles and nuclear centers if the U.S. imposed a "consistent measure".
He said Kim informed him that "consistent measures," which he expected were Trump's promise in Singapore to guarantee security and take action to build good relationships with Washington.
Harvard University students take adequate courses for relaxation.
This year’s new program at Harvard University is a program that gives all undergraduate students more sleep to discontinue their wider educational culture using caffeine as a fuel for ‘all night owls’.
Scholars find that students in the world's top universities often have no idea when it comes to basics on how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first course in the United States.
He was inspired to start this course after discussing sleep resistance that would affect learning.
'At the end of the course, a female student came to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this when I'm in my senior year?'
She said, "No one has ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me a lot," he said to The Telegraph.
This course is launched for the first time this year. It explains to students the importance of good sleep habits that can help improve their learning and sports, as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had been very sleepy and hard over the past week.
Long-term courses, including tasks requiring interaction.
In one category, there is a photo of a dorm room where when students click on a cup of coffee, curtains, trainers and books, they are told about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athletes’ performance and the importance of regular sleep time.
In another category, students are described as long-term sleep deprivation can pose the risk of heart disease, convulsions, depression and cancer.
Campus maps with interactive icons help students think about their daily lives.
'We knew that we would not be able to change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking,' added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in being a late-night owl continues, he said. Modern technology and increased pressure on students show that sleeplessness is a growing problem.
To ensure you have adequate sleep and good quality, it should be the student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation will lead the brain to starvation and will always starve.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course by taking one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course helped him brighten his eyes and motivated him to drive the entire campus.
The next step is that he hopes to be able to ask all graduate students to complete the same program before entering any competition system.
Professor Czeisler advises students to consider setting a wake-up time when it’s time to sleep, and beware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which are trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga made a goal from Gerrard's delivery ball.
The Rangers were crushed by the loss again when Dolly Menga made a Strike from Steven Gerrard's fiancee and was defeated by a 1-0 score at Livingston.
The Ibrox side recorded his first victory throughout the previous season, from a 4-1 draw in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team met Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving eight points behind in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
The Menga strikes in seven minutes before the first half time runs out, and the Rangers seem to be unable to hit the flank again.
While the Rangers were in sixth place, Livingston hit a shallow up in third place and was only away from Hibernian Gold.
Also, there may be additional problems for the Rangers when the Calum Spence Commissioner gets a head injury from a floating object into the field.
Gerrard decided to turn eight players, and that led Ayr to the finals of the Betfred Cup.
At the same time, Holt retained the same Livi 11 player profile, which focused on Hearts and was able to knock down opponents in every match.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball all the time, but Livingston took the lead and scored.
They had a two-minute chance to score when Menga passed the ball to Scott Pittman, allowing Allan McGregor to do gold, but the midfielder was able to take the lead.
Keaghan Jacobs' free kick helped send the ball to Craig Halkett, but his defense opponent, Alan Lithgow, managed to tag the defense.
The Rangers tried to control the game, but seemed to be a slight hope in the end play.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should get a penalty kick during his fifteen-minute clash with Steven Lawless, but Commissioner Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers managed only two shots in the first half, but Liam Kelly, the former goalkeeper Ibrox, was defeated by Lassana Coulibaly and made Ovie Ejaria a Strike.
In the 34th minute, Livi opened the aggression and no one could resist this run.
The Rangers missed again in defense of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who could add to the menga's beautiful end of the game.
Gerrard Zigzag and Coulibaly bothered Ryan Kent to tear the wings off the side and give Morelos the ball, but Kelly made a strong run.
However, Livingston continues to have fun competing games against the visiting team with long balls from Lithgow and Halkett alternatingly.
The Holt side may have a win in the final game, but McGregor blocked Jacobs well before Lithgow ran from the corner.
The Rangers switched to Glenn Middleton and found the penalty ball when he tried to each other, Jacobs, but Thomson missed it again.
Almanac: inventor Geiger Counter
This is a news page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, the same day 136 years ago, and the counting began ... The day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which contains an invention that leads to a device called the Geiger Counter.
Geiger Counter has become the core of science, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" directed by scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this device?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger Counter can be used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put your headphones on, you hear the effects of radioactive atoms in minerals."
Evans: "Like a flare-up!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the artifacts that used his name remain so far.
This new anti-cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells.
This new anti-cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to 'see' the bad cell and destroy the bad cell.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cell as part of the treatment.
How to extract immune cells from patients and adapt them to the laboratory?
They'll be able to 'see' common proteins in cancer cells and then be reused.
This experimental vaccine showed satisfactory results in various types of cancer patients.
A woman was treated with a vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize the dead cells, and as a result, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method is to separate immune cells from patients, bring them to the laboratory, so that they can "visualize" the common proteins in a variety of cancer cells called HER2, and then they will be recycled.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "describes the growth of a variety of cancers," including breast cancer, ovarian, lung, and large intestine, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teach" them how to target cancer cells used to treat leukemia.
Kanye West left Pro-Trump Diatribe with a MAGA cap following his SNL appearance.
Which didn't work very well.
Kanye West was harassed in a studio during Saturday Night Live after a performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for politics in 2020.
After that third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wears a Make America Great hat, he talks to the Democrats and reinforces Trump's support.
"A lot of times I've talked to white people, and they said: "Why do you like Trump?
Well, if I were against racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began a performance with Matt Damon, whose Hollywood star joked about Brett Kavanaugh's investigation of sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not published, it was uploaded a short story from West on social media from Comedy Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock is trying to discredit West.
Likewise, West was told to the audience that he had a problem with his hat when he was backstage.
"They teased me when backstage.
They said, 'Don't walk out with this hat.'
They teased me!
And after that, they also said I was in the bottom position," he said, according to a Washington Examiner.
West went on to say: "Do you want to see the bottom?" He said, "Put on my superman coat, because this is a show that you can't come and tell me what I should do. Do you want to push the world forward?
Let's give love."
His speech made it at least twice out of the audience, and the SNL members were embarrassed. A report from the people at the event said: "The whole studio is quiet."
West replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who had a boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, who died a few days ago.
West surprised many people with the song I Love it that he dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: Thank you for standing side by side with MOB."
But the talk-show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is a "representative of his identity and greatness."
"But I choose not to commend someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who, I believe, has a dangerous ideology for my community.
He has the freedom to do so.
"Just like us," she added.
Before the start of the show, Rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was "a man formerly known as Kanye West".
He was not the first artist to change the name and operate on Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and Puff Daddy.
Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Lion, is a legendary rapper. The legendary singer, Prince, has changed his name to symbol and is an artist formerly known as Prince.
There's a murder at the Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been arrested for murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast last Friday.
The incident took place at Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant must testify before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The crime prevention department will be investigated.
Kit Harington, an actor from Game of Thrones, is very fond of it.
Kit Harington is best known for his sword swing role, playing Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, the HBO Channel medieval fantasy series.
But a 31-year-old actor has published about the role of the hero, saying that the role on the screen is a reference to a young boy who often feels that they will be brave to gain respect.
Kit went on to say to The Sunday Times Culture that he believed something was wrong, and asked how to tackle a problem that had been so popular in the #MeToo era.
Kit is currently married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, a fellow actor of Game of Thrones. He also admitted that he felt he needed to present a 'serious' issue.
'I feel personally and seriously that we have created a mischievous popularity about being a man at what point,' he said.
'What should we teach men when they grow larger in the problems we are experiencing today?'
Kit believes that television media is responsible for the likes of this strong character.
He goes on to say: 'What is born and what is cultivated.
What's cultivated on TV and on the streets makes a young man feel that he must have the courage to grow up.
I think that's an important question for all of us.
'Cause it's obvious that there's something wrong with young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do Game of Thrones in the next season when the series would end this summer. He said, 'Enough with battlefields and horses.'
From November, the Kit will be featured in the sequel to Sam Shepard's True West, the author of the film, and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought meeting his wife Rose was the best thing he could get from Game of Thrones.
‘I met my wife on this list, so in this way it allowed me to meet my future family and my life from now on,’ he said.
Rose plays Ygritte in Jon Snow, the character whose Kit is featured in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China reported an increase of 14% in HIV/AIDS-affected population.
More than 820,000 patients were in the city, health officials said.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new patients are infected through sexual intercourse, a change from the past.
In the past, HIV has been transmitted through blood transfusions in some parts of China.
the Yunnan Convention on HIV-positive Patients
However, every year, the number of HIV/AIDS cases in China increases to 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a major problem among LGBT people in China.
Homosexuality is not considered a crime in China again in 1997, but there is still a discrimination against LGBT people.
Due to the conservative values of the country, it was studied and found that 70-90% of men who had sex with men would eventually marry women.
The spread of these infections comes from improper protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed internationally to taking part in the treatment of HIV as part of its efforts to solve problems.
Maxine Waters denied the allegations that employees provided information about the GOP Senators exposed to ‘fraud’ and ‘collusion’.
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters has denied about her employees having posted information about three U.S. Republican senators on a legislative Wikipedia page last Saturday.
The Los Angeles Democrats said the charges were investigated by experts and the website.
"It's all lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data report includes the home address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an anonymous Capitol Hill person during a Senate Committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the appointees of the Supreme Court. Brett Kavanaugh
The information leak was postponed after three Kavanaugh inquiry senators
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified the source of the post was linked to the Waters office and published the Waters official data reported by Hill.
"This untrue accusation is entirely false, and of course, this is a lie," Waters continued.
"My team of employees, who have personal information and security systems, are affected by false accusations and lies. They are not responsible for any leaks of this information.
This untruthful accusation is absolutely false and a lie."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism online, including former Secretary-General of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This denial represents anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that she doesn't have a good emotional maturity enough to be a member of Parliament.
When someone is accused of doing something not done, don't be angry.
They don't need to interact.
They don't have to focus on the accuser's motivation.
They must be calm and conscious."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh, a Democrat member, who was accused of showing too much anger during an interrogation last Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican member, has also seen Waters in mid-season elections, expressing his opinion on Twitter.
"Serious, but true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned "appropriate agencies and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims.
"We will do everything to expose the offender," she continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful to all members of my team."
Review Johnny English Strikes Again – Reviewed by Rowan Atkinson
Now, it is common to look for the implications of Brexit in any new film that shows British leanings. And it does not seem to be related to the restoration of Johnny English's actions. Comedians - starting back in 2003, Johnny English and the team came back again in 2011 with Johnny English's return.
How likely is the country's new export opportunities?
In any case, Johnny English, a comedian, faces the issue of renewal for a second time. His name has become an extensive cartoonist symbol, designed primarily for non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he’s a mad spy who, despite his bizarre pranks, has the aura of Clouseau, Mr Bean’s face-to-face comedy and the likes of Chariots of Fire, remixed in London in 2012 for the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
He is also based on Atkinson's world traveler personality when playing barclaycard TV ads that are now unreleased.
the Latest JE Outline
I liked Johnny English when I was about to take a helicopter and wear my armor, and there was a propeller on his helmet.
Atkinson has a talent for comedy, but it's rarely humorous. Especially for films such as 007 and Mission Impossible, which have comedy lines included in the present.
The humor will be childish, and for me, Johnny English's adventures are not very creative, and will focus more on the silent jokes in Atkinson's movies and bean style.
One of the most frequently mentioned topics is that the UK is getting into serious trouble.
Cyberhacker has infiltrated the UK’s top secret spy network, revealing the identity of all agents in the UK to destroy active agents, which is a tragic role for Kevin Eldon.
The last straw for the Prime Minister, who was a lazy and struggling man, was experiencing a non-popular political collapse: Emma Thompson played quasi-Teresa-May, but there was not much role in the script.
Her intelligence adviser informed her that when exposed to all active spies, she would have to send them out of the country.
And that means Johnny English, who is currently hired as the principal in an establishment, but there was a lesson on how spy works: jokes were inserted, as English presented a rock spy school.
English has returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing, and is a reunion with his partner Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is currently a married young man who has previously played a role as a sub-committee and has an entertaining personality that is not ideal for Vicki Pepperdine to take on the role.
For Batman and Robin, who made a big mistake in protecting the queen, returns to the throne, taking on the role of Olga Kurylenko by the beautiful girl, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is in danger under the spell of a talented billionaire, who claims that he can solve Britai's computer problems: Jason Volta, who is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started the story with jokes: disguised as waiters. Fired in French restaurants. They created chaos on the luxury yacht smuggling mission of Volta, and English tried to use Virtual Reality headsets to get acquainted with Volta's home interior.
Good storytelling, but still funny and entertaining, great for children's TV shows.

And like all of Johnny English movies, I can't help thinking that the British film industry wouldn't have allowed Rowan Atkinson to play a role worthy of his talent.
The labor department rejected Britons' plans to work four days a week, but had to pay a wage for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s labor department is considering a work plan. As you can see, Britons only work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
According to reports, the labor department wants the company’s bosses to add hi to their employees through AI by adding special holidays to them.
As you can see, the staff were happy with the three-day weekend, but still paid the same amount.
Sources say this idea is 'perfect' with economic conditions and increases employee benefits.
The transition to work four days a week was approved by the Trades Council and helped employees benefit from this change.
A senior labor source said to The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'This change will not take place overnight, but working only four days a week is consistent with the party's approach to rebalancing economics for workers, as well as the overall industry strategy of the party.'
The Labour Party will not be the first to approve this idea, but along with the Green Party that requires a four-day work week during the 2017 general campaign.
Nonetheless, there is still no certification from the labor department.
A Labour spokesman said: 'Four days a week's work is not a party policy, and the party will not be imported into consideration.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used the labor conference last week to impose his vision for the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he intends to withdraw power from the 'directors' and 'profit seekers' for public sector firms.
The Shadow Minister is planned, but the current stakeholders in the company may not receive additional compensation due to the labor department may be deducted incorrectly.
He also insisted that workers will be placed on the company board and created the Inclusive Ownership Funds to give employees up to £500 a 10 percent share of private company shares.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, said to "60 Minutes" that the FBI's investigation results for Kavanaugh's case may have caused them to change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh's case was postponed for at least a week and presented whether or not the findings of the office affected Republican Senators.
In an "60-minute" Sunday interview, Scott Pelley asked Republican senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI was under anything that would lead to a change of decision.
It seems that Kennedy is more open than his colleagues from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I was on my way to attend the investigation, I said, and I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after having this news with the question, 'Do you really do it?'
He has a certain determination."
However, Graham's vote to be recorded was quite long.
"I made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and will be given a severe sentence," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know: Brett totally denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And every name she can't confirm at all.
Aged 36 years
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how does it involve reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival featuring performances from celebrities, as well as an impressive mission to end poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year for the World Citizens Festival. Tens of thousands of people gather at Central Park’s large lawns. Not only do they enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but they also create awareness that is the true goal of this activity: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival 2012 is an additional project by Global Poverty, an international group of supporters hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting poverty.
To obtain a free ticket for this event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the participant must complete a mission or "event" such as volunteering, writing an email to world leaders, calling or performing any procedures that will help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen to achieve it within the remaining 12 years?
The idea of rewarding free concert tickets is simply a way of persuading people to call for action, or another way called "clicktivism", which allows people to feel that they are making a real difference by sending messages online or sending tweets.
Global Citizen said that since 2011, more than 19 million "activities" have been recorded from supporters, pushing to create different goals.
These activities motivate world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than USD 37 billion that can save the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 obligations and announcements based on the group’s activities, with a disbursement or funding of at least $10 billion.
The fund has been evaluated to help nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key obligations include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors committed to “helping children grow to their full potential” by promising Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in many cities after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, UK government, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make malnutrition, which is social injustice, become history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a live music show in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities were carried out in calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will support nutrition for up to 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "This will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we may fall and fail.
But like great citizenship rights and previous anti-racism movements, we will succeed because we are more powerful when united.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is one of the performances held this year in New York City, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the "security" fleet to block Russia's energy exports - Secretary General of the Interior
Washington's inspectors have cited Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, revealing that "if necessary" Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russia's energy from hitting various markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke referred to the Syrian meeting of Russia – eyewitnessly as legally carrying out the invitation of the government – was just an excuse to explore the new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to represent energy foreigners just as they do in Eastern Europe, which is a predominant part of southern Europe," he said, according to the news.
And, as officially stated, there are solutions.
With our Navy, the United States has that ability to ensure open sea channels and to close the way if necessary to ensure that their energy will not go out into the market," he said.
Zinke is referring to the event attendees organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that attributes itself to "the voice of energy users" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, remarking that they had the same effect.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is to exploit and substitute fuels, more or less," he said, while referring to Russia as a ""one-gun horse"" with a dependent economy on fossil fuels.
The statement came as Trump's administration launched a mission to promote exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe instead of Russia, a cheaper alternative to European consumers.
For the effect, Trump's executive officers, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline program that was "inappropriate", which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "consul" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $11,000 million, which is set to double the capacity of the existing pipeline, has become a purely economic project of 110,000 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's severe objection was merely driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be used as a tool to pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Alexander Novak, the Russian energy minister, after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. reacts strongly from Germany, confirming its commitment to the project.
Germany’s industry-leading organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI) has called on the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industrial Workers (BDI), after the subsequent meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "keep a close eye" on the presidential run in 2020, Massachusetts State Senators said.
Massachusetts state senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "take a closer look" in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the city's municipal office in Hoyoak, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our destructive government, and that includes having women on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will closely monitor the presidential candidates."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city's municipal office, stating that he was "bringing this county in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has made a silly speech in her criticism of Trump and Brett Cavanaugh, who were nominated as members of the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Surely we're going to have an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll that came out on Thursday showed that citizens in most democratic constituencies who supported Warren don't think she should be enrolled in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters "should be in," said the Massachusetts State Senators should not be enrolled, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such an application.
The poll showed that there was a greater support for candidates to former Governor Daval Patrick, with a 38 percent voice supporting potential candidates and 48% disagreed.
Other high-profile Democrats debated the possible 2020 election, including former Vice President Joe Byrd and Bernie Sanders, the state senator for Vermont.
Byrne said he would make an official decision by January, AP News reported.
Sarah Pellin's PTSD reference to Track Pellin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Paylin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence incidents on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through is coming back. I understand the other families that feel the PTSD's ramifications and some of the injuries our soldiers have received," she told the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paylin called his arrest the name "the elephant in the room" and said of her sons and other veterans. "They came back slightly differently; they came back stronger; they came back and were wondering if there was respect for what fellow soldiers and fellow pilots and other members of the army had given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons intoxicated.
18 states in the District of Columbia to challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a statement from a court friend Friday in Washington to challenge the asylum seekers’ policy, reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against an undisclosed federal policy.
She said her partner "and the son of her radical gang member" persecuted her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was detained in the U.S. state of Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produces a large number of asylum candidates in the United States as being facing widespread domestic gang-related and domestic violence.
A new U.S. asylum policy reversed the decision of the Refugee Commission in 2014 that allowed unauthorized refugees to flee domestic violence for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Supreme Prosecutor of the District of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy was "disregarding federal, federal, and international laws that have existed for decades."
"The federal law requires all asylum claims to be diagnosed on the facts and specific circumstances of those claims, and such actions are in violation of such principles," the court's friend commented.
Lawyers have argued that policy denying immigration caused damage to the U.S. economy, stating that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "enter the necessary labor".
Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, ordered immigration judges to no longer provide refugee shelter for victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"The asylum facility is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in certain social groups or political opinions," Sessions said in a policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum facilities have never been a way to relieve any problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Palu's desperate rescue efforts doubled in rushing for survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse and worse.
"It feels very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while comforting her little boy with hot fever at a refugee center in the messy town of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in someone's body against anyone.
Clean water is rare."
The villagers were found to have returned to their destroyed houses, searching for stuff that contained water, trying to recover what remains they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake were crowded.
Some of the injured include Dwi Haris, who suffers from back and shoulder fractures, staying outside Palu's military hospital where patients are being treated outdoors due to ongoing quakes.
The five-story hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There is not even time to save yourself from danger.
I was tightly squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I thought," Haris told the AP News Agency, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife pleading for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' and 'propaganda'
The U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited China Daily's additional payment in Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of attempting to intervene in the November 6 U.S. parliamentary elections. The allegations that China rejected
Trump's allegations that Beijing is attempting to intervene in the U.S. election mark what U.S. officials say to Reuters as the new phase of an up-level campaign by Washington to pressure China.
Beijing and Washington are now locked in a more intense trade war.
China’s anti-trade tariff rate was designed to attack exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump’s Republicans, said experts from China and the United States.
Terry Branscutt, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, long-standing exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing damaged laborers, farmers, and American businesses.
China, Bransted, wrote a comment on the Des Moines Register on Sunday: "Now double the bullying with our own independent newspaper propaganda."
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American free speech and free media traditions by placing paid ads on the Des Moines Register," Brandt wrote.
"On the contrary, here at Beijing's street newspaper stalls, you'll find limited disagreement and no reflection of what the Chinese might have on China's economic problems, thinking that the media is under the strong mandate of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He also added that "one of China's most famous newspapers has avoided a proposal to publish it."
Republicans defy women's voter turnout by disrupting Cavanaugh, analysts warn
According to several top Republicans standing by and defending Brett Cavanaugh, who was nominated as a member of the Supreme Court in the face of multiple sexual harassment accusations, analysts warned that they would see a particularly intense reflection from women during the midterm elections.
And most Republicans have said they want to move forward with the vote.
"These things can't go backwards," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell's Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the last minute push of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI's inquiry that it would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"The ladies will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman of the Progressive MovementOn group, Washington DC, Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they showed up in the Senate hall, while Republicans, who control the judicial committee, chose to move on with Cavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blassey Ford, reported by Mick.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are coming through the sky," Stu Rothenberg, a dissident political analyst, told the news website.
"People say it's already high. That's true.
But it could also rise again high, especially among women's electoral swings in suburban and minority voters, 18-29, where, while they don't like the president, they often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual harassment against the proposed Supreme Court member, analysts suggested severe reversal would be possible if the Republican Party pushed that confirmation forward.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or the final or whether Cavanaugh was taken in a reserve seat. It's also about how the Republicans handled this and how they treated her," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, who helped elect the Democrats, clarify the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to have a distinct voice who would have believed in the wake of Ford's testimony and Cavanaugh's will, too, to lean slightly towards the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are absolutely convinced or may believe in Ford’s statement, while 35 percent say they are absolutely confident or may believe in Cavanaugh.
Further, 38 percent said they thought Cavanaugh might have lied or lied exactly during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same thing to Ford.
After pushing from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations that Ford raised as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
The Senate Judiciary Committee sworn in last week that Cavanaugh overtook her intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez accused the nominee of being a member of the Supreme Court of revealing his genitals to her while they were partying while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventors plan to start a new kind of internet to fight Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup in the search for competitions with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of Inrupt Technology Legacy is a company built on Solid, the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid enables users to choose what their storage is and what people are allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the start.
"It's a time of history."
Such apps use Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online storage" or POD.
It can contain contacts, items to do, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify available, all in one browser and all in one time.
The special thing about personal online storage is that it’s completely up to users who can access any type of data.
This company called it "personal empowerment through data."
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea for Inrupt is for the company to adopt the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM. Some developers have contracted to work on projects and a community of volunteer coders.
Early this week, technology developers around the world can create separate apps from their own, using the available tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete transition, where their entire business model is turning completely overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
A post on the media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote, "The mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial and ecological energy to help protect the integrity and quality of new websites built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted to the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in Internet neutrality debates.
Even at the launch of Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Group, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for the next generation of web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vaughan: The Victorian Cross (a medalist of the British Army's Isles), World War I, celebrated.
The only British monk church that won the Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown 100 years ago.
Colonel Bam Royal Bernard Vaughan was awarded such an award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglie and Le Haucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he was awarded the British Army's highest honor.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandsons at a field walk in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his nephews, said that it was "a wonderful symbol". This stone would be revealed exactly 100 years later, from the award-winning success of his grandfather.
According to a London proclamation on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Queen's Foot, "through dense fog and under heavy bombardment from artillery and heavy machine guns."
Afterwards, he rushed to the firing line, and with his "greatest courage" he led the line forward before hitting the cannon alone and hitting three squadrons.
Lieutenant Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather's actions were, "Something I know I can't follow the pattern, but it's something that's humble.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, lay down a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be involved in this parade" and added that "the heroic courage of the real man has been expressed out of support by a large number of people."
MMA fans stay up late at night to watch Bellator 206. They return Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine spending the night watching the full Bellator 206 just in order to be denied entry to the main event.
Bill from San Jose had 13 fights, including six big matches and was live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in the UK were even shocked when the picture changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they stayed awake until dawn for this particular feat.
A fan on Twitter said of the switch to children's cartoons, "It's a boring joke."
"It is official regulations that at 6 a.m. the content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children’s show," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator Marketing and Communications, when asked about the switch.
"The pig girl, that's right."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they will set a deadline to include future British audiences.
"I think when I think of replays, I think we might go through smoothly," Coker said.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there, and we won't be able to fix this until Sunday at our time, Monday at their time.
But we're working on this.
Trust me, when there's that switch, there's a lot of text pushing back and forth, and they're not all friendly at all.
We've tried to fix it, we think it's a technical flaw.
But it's not. It's a government problem.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We'll keep it at five graphs instead of six - as we normally follow - and we've been trying to deliver too much to fans and we've just reviewed it.
It's an unfortunate situation, one situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'understood' in terms of gender
Tom Daley, Olympic jumper, said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his gender - but that has inspired him to succeed.
A 24-year-old man said he didn't think until he went to high school, "Not everyone is like me."
When it comes to Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, first presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had mentioned the rights of gay people to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a ruler made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the presenter of the long-standing show, has stopped working for several months due to illness.
It seems to me that being floated on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "a little more than all the others who grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings that feel a little bit less and feeling differently are really things that give me the power and strength to be able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "a special thing," he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally knew about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become the most watched and used LGBT campaigner in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to reduce homosexuality.
He said he called out loud because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without partition and wanted to give "hope" to others.
Three times the world champion said to fall in love with a man - Dustin Lance Black, the filmmaker. Who he met in 2013 - "Make me wonder."
Daley was married to an Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you've been through a lot since you were young" - he went to the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it's hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced the same everywhere.
This couple became the guardian of the child in June. A son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said, "All his attitude has changed."
"If you asked me last year, it would be about, 'I have to win the gold medal,' he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not admit that he was dying and one of the last things he had asked was if they had gotten tickets for them to go to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't say to him, ‘Dad won't be there to sit in the front row,' he said.
"I was holding his hand when as he stopped breathing, and until he really stopped breathing, and he died, I finally admitted that my father was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Summer Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I've just realized this is what I've been dreaming of all my life - to jump in front of the crowd from my hometown at the Olympics. There can be no better feelings than this," he said.
It also inspired his first selection of songs - Proud by Heather Small - which accompanied him in his formation to the Olympics and still gave him a creep.

"Michaelson Form Drops Old Sitting in Ryder Cup Saturday".
Phil Mikaelson, an American, would set a new record on Sunday when he played his 47th Match Ryder Cup, but he would have to turn his form back to avoid a major tragedy.
Mickelson has played at the event with two years as a record-breaking 12th place, being benched by Jim Furyk, captain of the team for the Foreballs and Foreball Championships on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action as he was often to the United States, these five major wins divided his day between being a cheerleader and making his game in the field, hoping to solve what made him miss.
The 48-year-old is not the ideal fit age for the Le Golf National course, where long and tough paths have overpowered many off-the-shelf balls.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mikaelson, on Sunday’s ninth match, faces the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newcomers Tommy Fleetwood to beat the Match in four matches this week.
If the Americans got four points lower at the start of the 12-match single, it could get hot.
Furyk shows confidence in his people. It's not like he can say anything else.
"He fully understands his role today, slaps it gently on my back and embraces the arms on me, then says he will be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He was very confident in himself.
He's the one who's been recognized for his hard work, and he's given a lot of effort to these teams in the past, and this week,
I probably didn't imagine him playing two matches.
I imagine more than that, but that's the way it fits out and that's the way we think we have to.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
Mickelson would break Nick Faldo's record for the most Match Raiders Cup appearances on Sunday.
It could have been the end of Ryder Cup's career that never matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost 20 times and another seven and a half, but Furyk said his identity brought something difficult to explain to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcasm, he's witty, he likes to play around with people, and he's a great person to be in the team room," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun with him, too, this week, which is fun to see.
He gave me something more than just playing a lot."
Captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knew that the lead could soon disappear.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that entering the last solo game in the Ryder Cup with enough lead scores can easily transform into uncomfortable.
The Dane debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the captain side-by-side by Sebi Bajasteros had five advantages over the American team, but passed the line with an unbeatable nose tip, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we're very ahead at Valderrama, we're very ahead at the Brookline where we lose, and that Valderrama where we win, but only slightly short of it," said Bjorn Photography, after watching the 2013 class, winning 5–3 on both Friday and yesterday to take the 10–6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in that team that this isn't over yet.
You're going to be so bored tomorrow.
Get out there and do the right thing.
This won't end until you get the score up on the board.
We have one goal, and that's trying to win this prize, and that's the focus.
I've always been talking, I've been focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're aware of what's on the other side - the biggest player in the world."
Given the delight that his players made a hard-hitting golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm not going to do anything beyond myself in this regard.
Tomorrow's another ferocious beast.
Tomorrow's a solo show to step forward, and that's something different to do.
It's great to be there with partners when things are going well, but once you're there one by one, you'll be fully tested for your potential as a golfer.
That's the message you want to send to the player: pull yourself out best tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your partner behind and he has to go and do his best, as well."
Contrary to Bjorn, Jim Furyk watched his players perform better individually as partners, except Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who scored three-quarters.
Furyk himself was once on both sides of the grand finale, being part of the winning team at Brooklyn before ending up being defeated when Europe achieved a "miracle at Medina".
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question, "How did Captain in 1999 Ben Crenshaw lead his players to the final day?"
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but you want to get to that fast start as you've seen at Brookline, as you've seen at Medina.
When that momentum starts pouring only one way, it causes great pressure on those medium-sized matches.
We align our ranks accordingly and bring them out in a way that we feel might be, you know, we're trying to make some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to be the leader in the invasion and confront Rory McIlroy in the top match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the sequence.
"I agree with these people in the following order, because I think it's covered in everything," Bjorn said of choosing single players.
Germany's new warship has been postponed again.
The German Navy's newest medium-sized warship should first be piloted in 2014 to replace an older Cold War warship, but it will not be there until next year, at least due to faulty and costly systems. Local media reported.
The first trial of the "Rhineland-Palatinate", the lead ship of the new, medium-sized battleship Baad-Württemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problem has adversely impacted the fate of ambitious projects.
The four Barangay-Württemberg class ships ordered by the Navy back in 2007 will replace the older Bremen medium-sized warships.
It is understood that they will be equipped with one powerful cannon, an anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile kit, as well as some invisible technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic drops.
Other key features, including longer maintenance periods - should be able to discharge the newest medium-sized warships up to two years out of the Port of Ton sub-committee.
However, a continuous delay means that this warship with state-of-the-art technology - which is said to enable Germany to shine its power abroad - will be outdated when it's time to take over, says Die Zeit.
The F125 medium-sized battleship, whose fate joked, made headlines last year. When the German Navy formally refused to experiment, sailed the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent ships back to shipbuilders after delivery.
Not much reason is known about the backlog, but the German press cited a large number of "errors in software and hardware" that made the warship useless if dropped into combat missions.
Software errors are of great importance as the Battleship Basel-Württemberg class will be controlled by over 120 crew members - only half of the manpower in the Bremen class medium-sized battleship.
It also appears that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to further upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" was believed to be twice the weight of the same class ships that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to hardware defects, the price tag of the entire project - including training the crew - is becoming another problem as well.
It is said to have risen to 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion USD) - an increase from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The recent mid-sized warships have become critical as Germany’s maritime powers are shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defense Committee, admitted that the Royal Navy actually "started to have no more warships that could be released."
Officials said the problem grew over time because the old ship was decommissioned, but no new ships were replaced.
He expressed condolences that no medium-sized warship, the Barg-Württemberg class, could fit into the Navy.
The National Conservation Agency
The new research that is being conducted on the ground on Scott's high ground was intended to reveal how bats used the terrain to hunt for food.
This unique flying mammalian behavior will help guide conservation activities in the future.
A study by scientists at the National Conservation Agency for Scotland will follow soprano and bicep bats, as well as brown long-eared bats and daubenton bats, at Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
A special recorder will be placed in important points throughout the area to monitor the activities of the bats throughout the entire season.
NHS officials and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld sensors.
All recordings will explore the frequency of bat transmission and what species are doing.
A map and housing report will be created to create a detailed geographical ratio of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that this results in revealing which residential areas are most important to this bat and being used by each species.
This information will help identify the benefits of housing management, such as grasslanding and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development work affecting residential and residential losses.
Wind turbines and lighting can be risky, as do sticky paper catches insects and treats building materials with certain chemicals, as do pet cat attacks.
The bat is actually not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they reach the stage of prey.
They use complex location identification techniques with reflective sounds to accurately identify the location of insects and obstructions in their flight paths.
NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historical buildings, 38 key parks and 76,000 hectares across the country, takes bats seriously.
There are ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, check housing and occasional assistance.
The organization has also established the first and only Scottish bat reservations at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight species of bats from ten Scottish species.
David Thompson, the area manager, said the land was an ideal area for them.
"At Threave here, we have a wonderful space for bats," he said.
"We have an old building, an old tree, and a nice place to live.
But there are many more stories about bats that are not yet known, so the work we do here and at other lands will help us understand more about what they need to grow out of offspring."
He emphasized the importance of bat inspections before maintaining the land, since unknowingly destroying one breeding home could kill up to 400 females and small children, which could wipe out the entire local population.
The bats are protected and illegal to kill, harass, or disrupt, or destroy their habitats.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish agent of Bat Conservation, has encouraged the public to join in.
She said: "We have a lot more to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are well-being."
Ronaldo denied allegations of rape while lawyers were ready to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the allegations of rape against him as a "fake news" by saying people "wanted to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer was ready to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published such allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus frontmen were accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mallorca in the Las Vegas Hotel Room in 2009.
He was alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep the incident in secret, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, said in a live Instagram video to 142 million followers, hours after the claim was reported and dumped it as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
"What they say today, fake news," the five-time winner of Baghdad said in front of the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by my name.
It's normal.
They want to have a reputation to say my name, but it's part of the job.
"I'm a happy and good person," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about such allegations, which they have called for "a reporting in a suspicious privacy area that is unacceptable," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said that athletes will ask for compensation for “moral damages in quantities corresponding to the weight of such violations, which may be one of the most serious privacy violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident was mentioned to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mallorca are reported back to the athlete's room, where he is accused of raping her anal, according to a document filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mallorca claimed that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good man" by missing "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual intercourse, but it was mutually consenting.
Mallorca also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures from a hospital injury, but later agreed to mediate outside the courtroom floor because she felt "fear of retaliation" and was concerned about "the public embarrassment".
34-year-old says she's now looking for ways to overturn because she's still shocked by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo is teaming up with Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italy’s Juve giant with a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'will regret it forever' to lose carmakers
UK "will regret it forever" if it loses its global leadership position in automobile production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Greg.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would result in a temporary production stop at a factory in Burnaston near Darby.
"We need a deal," Clarke said.
Japanese automakers say border delays in the Brexit incident have no agreement at all, causing job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produces nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% is exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain gets out of the EU by the end of March, we will see a stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers raise their fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade is carried out, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close a small plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The main concern involved what car manufacturers said was the risk of supply chains in the event that Brexit had no deal.
Toyota's production line operates by the "Timely Fit" principle, with spare parts coming in every 37 minutes from couriers in the UK and EU for cars to order.
If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there may be a border breakdown, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at its Darbisher factory, the company said, and that was to stop production.
Mr Clarke said Teresa May's chess scheme for future ties to the European Union was "pretty precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We have to have a deal, we want to have the best deal to make, as I speak, not only to succeed in the present, but for us to take this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today Show.
"The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what is a highly successful supply chain."
Toyota can't tell how long production will stop, but in the long run, it warns that rising costs will reduce factory competitiveness and ultimately lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston for 24 years and was a senior union leader at the factory, said his members were more concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs were lost, they would never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We push forward precise and reliable plans for future relationships with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump's high stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may have "been pushed for another week", while the fight as a nominee for Supreme Court member Brett Cavanaugh went on, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of a special adviser, Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian-elected intervention. What is the connection between Trump's assistant to Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the president?
Whether Trump fired the Attorney General's assistants, which in such a way would end Mueller's independence, splashed oil on Washington's gossip fires for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about wearing a device to record Trump's conversation and the possibility of dismissing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied such reports.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid reports that he was about to file his resignation letter.
Instead of meeting Trump, who was then declared Thursday by the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "loved more than not," chasing Rosenstein out, but then the meeting delayed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Cavanaugh and a woman accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the claim against Cavanaugh, delaying the vote of all senators.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein Conference, she said: "The date for that hasn't yet been determined, maybe this week, I can see that pushing away another week is all that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always like to update to the press."
Some reporters will argue that confirmation: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said that the no-conference press conference was not caused by the dismay of "seeking the attention of the audience" of the television commentator; however, she said: "I will not be able to agree with the fact that they seek the attention of the audience."
She then suggested direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"This president held a more question-and-response session than any other president before him," she said, adding, without citing evidence: "We have looked at those numbers."
The press conference would continue, Sanders said, but "if the press had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that would certainly be better than having a conversation with me.
We've tried to do that so much and you've already seen that we've done so much in the last couple of weeks and that's going to happen in a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
the White House or the Opening Ceremony
Single press conferences are rare.
New York this week, the president may show the cause by creating occasional bizarre and independent presences without any rules before gathering reporters.
The Health Minister wrote to European Union workers at the NHS Scotland about fears of Brexit.
Health ministers have written letters to European Union officials working in the NHS of Scotland to express their appreciation for the country and wish them the same way after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK to withdraw from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has committed to handling the cost of applying for a residence status for EU citizens working in forwarded public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "This summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union regarding the withdrawal have continued, leading to the expected decision this fall.
But the UK government has begun preparations for a possible unconventional situation.
I knew this would be a daunting moment for all of you.
That’s why I want to reiterate how much I value employee engagement, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christon Abercrombie is in emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie Linebacker, the Tigers in Tennessee, suffered an emergency surgery after a head injury on Saturday, defeating Vanderbilt Commodores to 31-27 Mike Organ of Tennessee, reported.
Rod Reed, head coach in Tennessee, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
"He came to the edge of the field and just collapsed there," Reed said.
The trainer and medical personnel provided oxygen to Abercrombie at the edge of the field before taking him up a stretcher and bringing him back to further assessment.
A Tennessee official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were "no details about the type/severeness of the injury at this time" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to find a way out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie senior Red Shirt was in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He earned a total of five tackles on Saturday before having to leave the game, which made his entire season making 18 tackles.
Overseas buyers are collecting higher stamp duty when they buy UK property.
Overseas buyers will be collecting higher stamp duty when they purchase UK assets with additional cash that will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plan.
Such a move would be against Corbin's successful drive to persuade young voters.
Stamp duty will be collected from UK tax-free persons.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to collect up to £120 million a year – to help homeless people.
Overseas buyers will start collecting higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - with additional cash that will be used to help homeless people. Teresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbin’s successful drive to pull younger voters’ voices, with promises of housing prices rising and targeting large-income residents.
The stamp duty will be charged to individuals and non-tax companies in the UK with extra money to increase the government's mobility force against hard sleep.
Additional money - which, in addition to the current stamp duty, includes higher levels, was introduced two years ago in the second house, and lease purchases - can be as high as three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise £120 million annually.
About 13 percent of London-built assets were bought by non-British residents, pushing prices up and making first-time buyers more difficult to acquire.
Many rich areas of the country - especially the capital - have already become a "ghost city". Because many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty reduction to help young people make it easier to own their first home.
He accused a large construction firm of pulling the property price high by snatching the land, but did not exploit it and urged Mrs. Mey to quit the quota in a affordable house to resolve Britain's "fairly humiliating" home affairs.
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of dramatic housing reforms that include lease control and "no offense" termination.
He also wanted to add power to the council to build a new house.
Mrs. May said: "Last year, I said I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to the restoration of the British dream - that this life should be better for each young generation.
And that means fixing our ruined housing market.
England is always open to those who want to live, work and live here.
Non-U.K. Residents Like Foreign Companies
Too many people dream about homeownership are getting too far away, and the embarrassment of hard sleep is always true. "
Jack Ross: 'My highest ambition is to organize the Scottish administration.'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "highest ambition" was to become Scotland's executive manager during a period of time.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the challenge of reviving North-East clubs who are now in the third place in the One League, three points away from the top.
He moved to the Offensive Stadium this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I want to play for my country as one player.
I got the B cap and that's it," Ross told the Sportssound of BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it's something special that always brings me back.
Yet that opportunity will come if I succeed in running the club."
Sunderland's previous managers included Dick Adfogat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Ganio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief said he was not afraid to follow the name established in such a large club, having previously rejected the tampering from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is now measured by 'Can I bring the club back to the Premier League?'"
Due to the structure and facilities of the club, there is no doubt that it belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It wasn't easy to get there, but I could only look at myself to succeed here if I could get the club there."
Ross came into his management career just three years after one period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell in Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from a fall to the third, and converted St. Mirren from almost a fall to the winner of the championship the following season.
And Ross said he was now more comfortable than when he had played in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It could be a real crossroads," he thought of taking charge of Alloa.
"I truly believe management is more appropriate for me than playing.
It sounds weird because I'm doing well, earning enough and being fairly happy.
But playing can be difficult.
There's so much you need to do every week.
I still struggle with that in terms of stress and stress, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to run and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable thing I've ever felt on my own skin all my adult life."

Summer heat waves have increased revenues for struggling UK pubs, but have put more pressure on the restaurant network.
Pubs and bars had a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
CGA business consultant Peter Martin, who collected the figures, said: "The continuous sunlight and the long-lasting participation of England in the World Cup meant that July had a similar pattern to June, when pubs increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that were hit harder.
A 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant's trade in June was worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that focus on drinks show the strongest with increasing compared sales as restaurants deteriorate.
Food-sensitive pubs are also badly under the sun, although not as much as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
The beverage sales of pubs and bars that handled the entire administration increased by 6.6 percent this month, with foodstuffs dropping by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst on the side of leisure time and RSM services, said: "These results are still a trend we have seen since late April.
Climate and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to outdoor market sales.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle, although sales dropped by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year were particularly painful, requiring continuous cost pressures.
"Is it possible to say that the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will significantly ease the need?"
The growth of total sales in pubs and restaurants, as well as the opening of new stores, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in branding.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitors industry sales in the UK, pubs, bars and restaurants sectors. It collects and analyzes work data from 47 operating groups, with an aggregate of over 9 billion pounds and is an established industry benchmark.

One in five children – some as young as 11 years old – are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the "fake Instagram" account - a reference to Instagram photo sharing site
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they were using a clean, "core" account to show their parents while also having a private account.
One of the mothers, who accidentally passed by, saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, found out that there was a teen tempting someone else to "rape me."
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the meeting of male principals and female principals of private schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, half of which are admitted to maintaining personal accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's outrageous that many teenagers are lured to create an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "a voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Commission.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Executive Committee.
Doyle is Scotland’s most medal-winning track and field athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes this action as an opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her international experiences over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected by Scotland, the UK, and the world's athletic community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit tremendously from bringing her to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to serve as a voice for athletics and I really hope that I can participate and help guide the sport in Scotland."

He posted on Twitter: "One month ago, today I'm having a stroke.
I can't walk.
Doctors say only time will tell how much I can recover or how much I can recover.
It's a very difficult task, but full recovery, learning how to walk, and today's training of agility!
Thank you for your encouraging message!"

To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent-wearing milk pump", Elvie Consumer Technology released a serious music-inspired ad, a comedy-inspired video to show the freedom that a new pump can offer to expressive mothers.
The four real mothers danced in a cowhouse full of hay to a song with lyrics like, "Yeah, I milked myself, but you didn't see the tail," and, "In case you didn't notice, these were not milk, they were my breasts."
The petition continued: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding the babies, pump it out, I'm milking my girls."
However, such ads, published on the company’s Facebook page, have caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed responses from audiences, many of which said it overlooked the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"The terrible decision was to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to conceive and give birth to milk, except for their babies stolen from them within days of giving birth, one of them wrote.

Another commented: "It's a comprehensible mental injury for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk pumps for mothers to get their babies."
Others added: "What an unconscious commercial."
Others set out to protect the ad, with one woman admitting that she thought the song was "amusing".
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'll find one if I'm still breastfeeding.
Pumping milk makes me feel like a real cow.
The ads are a little crazy, but I assume that's what it is.
"This is a genius product," another wrote.
Another commented: "This is an entertaining ad. Focus on the maids who pump milk (usually at work or in the bathroom) and feel like a "cow."
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the milk industry at all."
At the end of the video, the women's group revealed that they were all dancing with where the milk pumps concealed a sample in their bra.
The idea behind this campaign is based on discretion that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, with no wires or hoses and fits in the breast bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: “Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
With parallel lines between women's expression and dairy cows, we want to provide milk pumping and all its challenges to stand out while demonstrating how fun and accessible the incredible autonomy that this new pump will provide.
This isn't the first time an Elvie pump has made headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, two mothers and one child appeared on the catwalk to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of refugee children were quietly transferred to camps with tents on the Texas border.
The number of detained refugees has steadily increased, although crossing the border is still quite constant. Partly because the persuasive and rough policies proposed by Trump's administration make it more difficult to place children with patrons.
Traditionally, most patrons are immigrants without documentation and are afraid to risk their ability to live in the country by grabbing a child.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential patrons and other adult members of their families would have to submit their fingerprints and that information would be shared with government immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior officer, Matthew Albence, along with the U.S. immigration and import tax department, told the U.S. Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for minor sponsorship alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the patrons or members of the patron's household are illegally here in this country, and most of those people are criminal aliens.
So we continue to pursue these individuals," Mr. Albenz said.
To find out how to get kids through the process faster, authorities have proposed a new regulation that will require some children to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of more than 60 days, which is an earlier standard, according to a shelter worker.
Many would appear through video conferences instead of coming on their own to ask for their legal status with a judge on immigration matters.
Those who are considered to be inappropriate for relief will be quickly banished.
If children are kept in custody, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which could lead to severe eruptions or escape attempts, according to a report from refugee workers and reports that emerged from the system a few months ago.
Sponsors say those concerns rise in larger locations, such as Tornillo, which is a sign that children with struggles are more likely to be overlooked due to their size.

Syria tells U.S. ‘forces take over’ France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Valyad Al-Mo’allam, the Foreign Minister also urged Syrian refugees to return home despite the country’s eighth year of war.
Moalem, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syria's territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said at a meeting.
Moalem insisted that "the war on terror is nearing its end" in Syria, which has already killed over 360,000 people since 2011, with millions more being evacuated from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territory" of the militant group, and that "the presence of illegal examples of foreigners" would continue.
The U.S. has over 2,000 troops in Syria. Most of them train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a country devastated by war.
On the issue of refugees, Moalem said the conditions were acceptable for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "unreasonable fears," which prompted refugees to retreat.
"We have called on international communities and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are making a political matter in what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The U.S. and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement between Azad and the opposition ends the war.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey in the clashes in the strongholds of Idlib's last major rebels has created opportunities for political negotiations recklessly.
The Russian-Turkish agreement turned a large attack by Syrian forces backed by Russians in the province, which had three million residents.
However, Moalem stressed that the agreement had a "definite deadline" and expressed hope that military operations would target the jihadists, including warriors from the al-Nusra lineage linked to al-Qaeda who "will be eliminated".
The UN representative, Stephan De Mistura, hopes to hold the first meeting of the new committee, which includes government and opposition members, to draft the post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moalem put the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in such committees, saying that the jury's work should be restricted "to the review of the various sections of the current constitution" and warned against anti-government intervention.
Why Trump Wins Second Season
With that logic, Trump will win the 2020 re-election, except (as many free-thinking viewers may hope) that the prosecution and scandal will end his presidency early.
In what, undoubtedly, "the most remarkable chapter of the presidential presidency ever existed!"
At this point, there's no sign of fatigue in the audience.
As of 2014, rating primetime has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average primetime audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago. According to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s "Rachel Maddow Show" peaked on the line with 3.5 million viewers on the big news night.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to because it is not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who starred in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about the Secretary-General, who became president after the attack, has destroyed the parliament building.

Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story coming out of Washington may determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether or not the immigrant families can meet again and the health of the global economy.
Non-following is the luxury that only the highest-priority audience can do.
Yet, it's more than a data-driven citizenship when you find yourself spending six hours watching a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" as the source of his $15,000 "Fear" book, the Ostrich Leather Bomber Jacket of Paul Manafort ("Dark clothes of arrogance," said the Washington Post), and the implied meaning of Stormey's shocking explanation to Daniels.
I wouldn't look at the same Super Mario again.

When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny, 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Cawi Island, but he sat inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to peel himself off, notwithstanding Brett Cavanaugh's aim to confront the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court uncertain where to go.
"I remember when we were still able to do some of those horrific shows in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,"" Mr. Fleisch told me."
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

the Midterm Elections
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th place is seeing overwhelming money due to the congressional redistricting that left two candidates competing in the same seat.
Recently, the Pittsburgh suburban re-painted, creating a footprint for the Democratic representative Conor Lamb - the chair winner in another district in the previous spring special election.
Lamb is competing with Keith Rothfuss, another Republican who is currently representing the 12th District, Old Pennsylvania, which overlaps dramatically with the 17th District.
The map was repealed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district had an unfairly exploited electoral district as you and the Republicans were.
The new 17th District race triggered a monetary duel in campaigns between key financial groups, the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Caucus Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a slight victory in the March special election for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress.
The seat was dominated for more than a decade by the Republicans, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 votes.
Political experts have given Democrats a little advantage.
The U.S. weighed El Salvador's penalty over Chinese support and retreated.
The diplomat remarked that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners drove out the Trump organization's management team.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials decided to call back the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama on "the latest decision not to accept Taiwan anymore," said a spokeswoman for the ministry in a statement earlier this month.
But there was only a penalty trial against El Salvador, where it received about $140 million in aid to the Americans in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reducing financial aid and limiting targeted visas, can be painful for this Central American country, as well as the country's high unemployment and murder rates.
The North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level security and economic prosperity conference to pursue similar gatherings last year, which were seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the US.
But by mid-September, senior management had made it clear that they wanted the meeting to go ahead, which would effectively end El Salvador's sanctions.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to attend the meeting, which is now scheduled to take place in mid-October as a sign of the administration's place of importation in the gathering, a diplomat said.
And three American diplomats returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic quietly, without any message or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton declined to comment on the discussions described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the conditions of anonymity.
Their accounts are confirmed by external analysts close to the administration and have also spoken of the condition of anonymity.
Education Background
The next pair of shoes to drop may have been Robert Mueller's report, a special adviser on the possible obstruction of justice for Mr. Trump, who now has plenty of evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller was also reported to turn his investigation to see if Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in attacking our elections.
If the U.S. Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing responsibility, just as he prepares to go again in front of voters and possibly the jury of his friends.
That is, if so much wasted, and I don't mean to say that Mr. Trump's collapse was inevitable -- and the equivalent of him in Europe.
There is a choice we all must make by us all on both sides of the Atlantic, which will result in how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to execute Hitler's execution state, if only the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid bloodshed over the years that had happened.
The historical path around such a turning point and the incessant march of democracy has been accelerated or delayed.
Americans face these divergences now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump is chasing Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller's interrogation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this paper reported last year that he said he was secretly recording the president's voice and predicted he wasn't fit for office.
Mr Rosenstein said The Times' account was incorrect.
"How would we respond if the new F.B.I. investigation by Brett Cavanaugh was incomplete or fair – or if he insisted on the Supreme Court, even though there were credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote midterms for Mr. Trump to explain?
If we fail to do those tests, democracy will fall to the long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz by the original Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and in the next 60 years sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graeme Dorrans of the Rangers
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing the victory over the Austrians. After an impressive match in Spain against Bijarreal earlier this month, it placed them in a strong position to pass the qualifying round from the Europa League's G group.
The knee injury made the midfielder Graeme Dorrans unable to appear for the first time in the season until always 2-2 against Bijarreal, but he believed that the Rangers could use that result as a jump to something greater.
"It's a good one for us because Bijarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We landed the game by believing that we might get something and get one point.
Maybe we're a little hopeful at the end, but overall, always is a good result.
They could have been better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were on the better side.
Coming into Thursday, it's another great European night.
Hopefully, we can grab three points, but that's a tough game because they've done well in their last game. But with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can be strong and positive.
This year was definitely a difficult year between everything that happened to my injury and change at the club itself.
A good team and the boys enjoy it a lot, good training.
Hopefully, we can be optimistic now, leaving the last season behind us and succeeding."

The man was shot several times with a wind rifle in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot with several wind rifles as he walked home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hands.
Authorities described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 BST, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His wounds were non-life-threatening and police requested witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunami occurred several times in Indonesia.
At least 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's Palu city on Friday.
With the shutdown of communications, relief personnel were unable to receive any information from the Donggala office. The northern area of Palu is closer to the point above the 7.5 magnitude earthquake center.
In Palu, more than 16,000 refugees were displaced after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an office that stretches along the coast of more than 300 km (180 miles) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The office, which is a smaller administrative district than the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic activities of the central Sulawesi province, especially on the coast of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also significant in such provinces as well, but mainly at Morovalli on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by multiple tsunami in the last 100 years, according to Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The 1996 Western Donggala tsunami struck nine people.

Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: The Great Earthquake on the West Coast of Indonesia's northern Sumatra province on December 26 triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast; more than half of them were people in Ajjah.
2005: Severe earthquake hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
the Sumatra Isles
2006: 6.8 magnitudes hit southern Java Island, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coastline, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 enters near Padang, the capital of western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits the islands of Mentawi off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pidie Jaya office in Ajjah, causing destruction and panic when people are reminded of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died from the collapse.
2018: A major earthquake hit Indonesia’s landslide island, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
This earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
Track Pellin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Pellin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Vasylla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, overcoming reports of domestic violence and violating arrest, according to a report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to police, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report such alleged crimes, he grabbed her phone out of her.
Pelin is currently in custody in place prior to Mat-Su's trial, and is bailed with an unpaid $500 bond, reported by KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "no offense, certainly not guilty" when being asked for his complaint, reported by the network.
He faces several class A criminal offences, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B felony with a one-day imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time a criminal case has been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pelin.
Sarah Palin, his mother, called the police to report the alleged attacks.
The case is present in front of the Alaska State Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with reporting domestic violence, and possessing an intoxicated weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 after being linked to her son's violent behavior with the PTSD caused by his involvement in Iraq.

Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for suspects of terrorist attacks in NYC.
A federal prosecutor in New York is looking for the death penalty for Zephyllo Zypov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people—a rare punishment that has not occurred in such a state for a crime imposed by U.S. law since 1953.
Sipov, 30, was accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to attack a bike path along a westbound highway in lower Manhattan, swept over pedestrians and bikers on his way on October 30.
In order for the prosecutors to prove that Zypov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, based on the intent of the death penalty, filed a document in the southern part of New York.
Both of these charges can be put to death, based on court documents.
Several weeks after the incident, a federal grand jury slapped Zypov with 22 accusations, including eight homicides in aid of fraud, which were generally used by federal prosecutors for crimes and violence and destruction of several automotive engines.
Such allegations require "extreme planning and prior contemplation", the prosecutor said, describing the manner in which Sipov carried out the act as being in a "evil, cruel and moral manner".
"Sayfullo Habibulla Avik Zypov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims are tourists from Argentina.
the Southern District of New York
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two couriers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used was in a 1953 New York federal case for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The spouse was executed after a conspiracy to espionage the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg's family were executed with electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
Zypov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months after the allegations, according to court documents.
He made a statement to the interrogators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Zypov told authorities he was inspired to launch an attack after watching several Isis videos on his phone, based on the prosecution.
He has also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He did not admit any of the 22 accusations.
David Patton, one of Zypov's representatives, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We think the decision to find the death penalty is more than just accepting responsibility for asking for life in prison without release will simply prolong the trauma in the heart of these events to everyone involved," Patton said.
Zypov's defense team asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP said the NIGEL FARAGE should be given to act in negotiations, Brexit.
Nigel Farage vows to 'move people' today during protests at the Tory summit
Former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to 'feel the heat' from the anti-EU concept - as one of the parliamentarians of Teresa May himself has proposed that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Boone, a conservative backbencher, said the march in Birmingham would have been 'out of the UK', now if Mr Farage was Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge that Ms. May faced in her deeply divided team was lined up by supporters of the Remain Tories, who participated in a separate protest against the city's Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers remedy plan out of the way amid attacks from the Brexit, the Remains and the European Union.
The Allies insisted that she would push ahead in an attempt to make a deal with Brussels despite that severe reflection – and forcing anti-EU concepts and labor choices between her package and the 'collective chaos'.
Mr. Boone said the exit meant a rally out in Solihull that he wanted to 'throw the Chequers'.
He suggests that Mr Farage should be appointed as a colleague and take responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
‘If he were in charge, we'd be out now,’ he said.
Members of Parliament Wellingborough added: 'I will stand up for Brexit, but we must throw Chequers away.'
His EU objection statement, he said: ‘We are not fighting the World War in order to surrender.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Boone dismissed the proposal that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people had changed their minds and wanted the same was untrue.'
Andrea Jenkyns, the Tory Brexit activist, was also at the march, the reporter said: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are not popular with the general public. Opposition will not vote for it. It is not popular with our party and activists who really crushed the roads and made us elected in the first place.
Please drop the Checkers and start listening.'
In a straightforward statement to Mrs May, she added: 'The Prime Minister kept their work when they kept their promise.'
Mr Farage said politicians gathered to 'feel the heat' if they were to betray the 2016 referendum decision.
‘It is now a matter of trust between us – people – and our political class,’ he said.
‘They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, ‘We're not going to let you escape by doing that.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class who is about to betray Brexit feel that heat.
'We are moving the army of the people of this country, which gave us victory in Brexit, and there will be no rest until we become an independent, self-governing, and proud Britain.'
Meanwhile, the Remain marched through Birmingham two hours before a rally in the middle of town.
Snake-fish knowledge of activists waved to Tories against the Brexit flag after the group's launch this weekend.
The labor nobles, Lord Adonis, mocked the conservative party for the security issues they faced with the party's applause when the meeting opened.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can have a fully IT system and a whole range of technologies for Canada plus for non-contradictory borders to non-contradictory free trade in Ireland,’ he added.
'It's totally funny.
Nothing could be a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's plan to 'examine' the presidential run.
U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "excitely stare at the presidential election" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a meeting at a city hall in Western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular reviewer for President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chairs the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she may face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at the Holocaust was her 36th meeting with democratic citizens using the form of the town hall since Trump entered office.
The attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied, "It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and that includes the women on the top."
The arrest of the Sims assassination of LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that one of the suspects had been arrested on charges of shooting, killing a basketball player, LSU Wayde Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. ET press conference.
They have released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man seen in the video clip.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the University of Southern area early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died," Murphy J. Paul, a police chief told the media last Saturday with 247sports.
Wayde walks in defending his friend and is shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, possessing the weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an unexpected incident and detained at the Baton Rouge East Patriarchate.
The 6-foot 6-inch junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims has played in 32 games, with 10 of them playing the opening game of the previous season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is nearing the world rankings after the team sent him to victory over Sebastian Fettle.
It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas passed the selection before leading forward Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team would compete in most of the competition.
Out of the pole Bottas started well and almost let Hamilton wait until wrinkling as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel enters the pit first and lets Hamilton run into the swarm. It's supposed to be cut.
Mercedes ran one lap later and fell behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook the front after a brace to see Ferrari drivers reluctant to let the inside empty to take the title risk after two moves to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then went on to take the lead as most of the race as he held his tire tight to aim for a quick goal to reach the finish line and Sangkimi Rykonen to be fourth.
He finally entered the 44th round, but could not speed him up in the remaining eight rounds while Rykonen ranked fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did great all weekends and was the real gentleman who told me to go with it.
"The team has done such a great job of getting a series of punches," Hamilton said.
That's a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday, where she insisted she had not unveiled a letter from Christine Blassie Ford that accused Brett Cavanaugh, who was nominated as a member of the Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention in Ford's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead expressing that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "seriously narrow and offensive and unfaithful".
"One thing that can happen and the beautiful things that are happening over the last few days in the Senate when you see anger when you see a person who is angry and greedy and naive and unfaithful," he said.
"When you watched the press release and the press release, then they said, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein: Did you release a leak?
Remember her answer... did you release a leaked document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't let the leak."
All right, wait a minute.
Did we let the leak... no, we didn't let it leak," he added, mocking the senator's gestures.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Cavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came out of her office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's accusations, I'm not releasing her story," Feinstein said to the board of The Hill Report.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as she asked."
But her rejection doesn't seem to please the president, who commented on Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you what, that's a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Proceedings defending his nominee as a member of the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested the Democrats used such accusations for their own sake.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the negligence, the disgust, those people -- they don't care who's hurting, who they have to tread on to gain power and control," Mediaite reported the president's statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer swung two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars was eye-washing the Elite League on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning in a 5-3 eye-wash match at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two points ahead of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie always beat the home side before Dwyer regains the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard always made Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen would make the door-to-door win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for the man of Adam Keefe, who followed up to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning the race three times earlier.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from backing Kendall McFaul with David Rutherford giving backing, while Beauvillier scored two points leading four minutes later.
During a messy opening match, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt became the Cownie's goalkeeper at 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer made sure the Giants scored the lead in the first brake when he shot his second goal on the night at the end of the first period.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard once again brought the team up to the top with a powerful score of 27:37 minutes.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen make Dundee the first lead in the match in the second period and he made sure to win with the team's fifth score in the halfway line of the final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, returned to Milton Keynes' home in the next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers sacrificed to make sure hundreds of people on board could escape the earthquake.
Indonesian air traffic controllers are being praised as heroes after his death to make sure one aircraft carrying hundreds of people flew safely off the ground.
More than 800 people were killed and many were lost after the Great Sulawesi earthquake last Friday that caused a tsunami.
The severed aft shocks continued to intensify within the area and many were trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues' escape, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in a severely swaying control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufrey airport, Palu's airport.
He was on a checkpoint to ensure that the 6321 battalion, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the flight control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died in hospital later.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesperson for the Indonesian air march, said this decision could save hundreds of lives. ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard this," he added.
At the same time, officials feared that the number of deaths could reach thousands, with the country's relief agencies saying that access to Dongkala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
"The number of deceased is believed to continue to rise as many bodies are still under debris, while many are still inaccessible," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency.
A wave of up to six meters has devastated Palu, which will organize mass burials on Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in the body.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets have been all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross Council in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross Council is accelerating to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the work related to the evacuation.
Are you guys ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia earlier this year was affected by an earthquake on a landslide island that killed over 550 people.
The plane crashed in Micronesia: Air New Guinea now says a man is missing after the plane crashed into a lake.
The airline, which serves a plane crashed into the Pacific Lakes in the Micronesia region, now says a man is missing, after previously saying that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
Air New Guinea said in a press release that in the episode on Saturday afternoons could not comment on the male passengers.
The airline said it was working with local government agencies, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to requests for further details about such passengers, such as his age or nationality.
The local ship rescued passengers and other crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport at Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers were still at the hospital Saturday and all were in danger.
What causes the fall and the exact sequence of events is not clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane had landed in a lake with a short runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was running beyond the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down very low.
"That's a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade through a deep, waist-high water to an emergency exit on a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendant panicked and yelled around, and he himself suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said crews working nearby to improve the docks also assisted in rescue by using inflatable boats to pick-up people before the aircraft sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate 111 deaths due to the crash of airlines registered with PNG in the past two decades, but none of them are associated with Air New Guinea.
Analysts lay out the evening women's timeline burned alive.
The prosecution ended Saturday in an appeal against a man accused of burning a Mississippi state girl alive in 2014.
Donald, U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, has been standing for several hours as an expert witness for intelligence analysis.
He concluded to the jury how he used cell phone records to recapture the motions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the victims of the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location information from several cell phone shows that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, which contradicted his previous claim, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the information shows that his cell phone was with Chambers' moment he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on Saturday and gave the statement that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they have known each other for only one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted the messages, calls, and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense was scheduled to begin the closing of the dispute on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to reach the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Hip Hop Consciousness?
Trio Hip-Hop wanted to challenge the negative aspects of the genre by filling positive messages into their songs.
The High Breed from Bristol claimed that Hip-Hop moved away from its origins as a political message and criticized social issues.
They want to return to their original roots and make Hip-Hop consciously popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen their recent recovery in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?!
The NY nanny sued the couple after being fired after a "racist" message.
The New York nanny is suing the couple for a selective expulsion after receiving a message sent wrongly from a mother who complains that she is "another black man".
They both deny that they are racists, comparing petitions as extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the two-child mother, was shocked when she found that Giselle Maurice, the new childcare provider, was black when it arrived on the first day of work in 2016.
"No way, no. Another black man is gone," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
After recognizing her rudeness, Plasco-Flaxman, who "is uncomfortable", fired Miss Maurice, stating that their socially affluent nanny, who is African-American, works poorly and she expects to get a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation from the licensing and is seeking compensation for a $350 fine per day for six months, a short-term career at her pre-employment home, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do anything like that," she told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple sued back claims that they were racist that ending Maurice's employment was a reasonable thing to do, fearing they would not be able to trust her after committing a crime against her.
"My wife sent something to her that she did not intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But will you rely on your child in the hands of someone you're rude to, even if it's a mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on."
The likelihood of the petition is that it was like "extortion", Plasco said his wife had only given birth two months and was in "a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to strike someone like that?
That's not a good thing," said the Finance Minister.
While lawsuits continue, the court of public opinion has urgently condemned this couple on social media, harassing them in their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publisher fears readers won't understand the bears speak.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted. Said of such a letter: “It’s hard to please us, pay attention to someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's ridiculous to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
Saying that her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write children's books with a toy bear, would have been cheerful at his rejection. She added that her 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she adds that her father is proud of the achievements that have taken place in the quietest of times.
"He's quite quiet, and he's not boasting," she said.
"But since Paddington is so real for him, it's almost as if you have a child who has achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not really yours.
I think he's been looking at Paddington's success in that way.
Even though it was his creative and imaginative, he always credited Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye through the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was sent to Louis Pasteur II Hospital of Nice, where doctors worked to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, she didn't expect to survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad to say she was dying within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm going to stay with her.
The pharmacist had given her a treatment to keep her heart pumped. Slowly slowed down and out of her system.
She had died a while earlier, and this was when all was shut down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing this was squeezing out.
I can't even weep or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is now saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - not knowing what the pain she was facing.
"No one knows," she said.
"I bowed down my face and tears fell down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on this flight I felt Nad's overwhelming sympathy.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves you."
Women who mourn post cards to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have put cards on the bridge of Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler was 13 years old, the son of Ms. Davis, when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel today," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, a resident of Lydney, said her son was a future cook with a forward-looking smile.
"Everybody knows him because of his smile.
They always say that his smile illuminates any room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he "was in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's eleven-year-old brother at the time was the one who met his brother after he ended his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that there will be a knock on effect."
Ms. Davis has created a card "so that people know there are people out there that you can go to and you can talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't just sit quietly -- you have to talk."
Ms. Humphrey, who had been friends with David Knowles for many years, lost Mark, who was her mate for 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
"He doesn't say he feels bad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He's at the bottom of Christmas - when the kids open their presents, he doesn't make eye contact with the kids or anything."
She said his death was a major trauma in the heart for them, but they had to go through it: "It tears through the family.
It rips us apart.
But we all have to stand and fight."

The future of Brett Cavanaugh is uncertain where to go when the FBI begins an investigation.
"I think, if we could get something like what he really asked for - the investigation was limited by a limited time - we could bring a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the board would "break into risks" amid the jams of the tight-knit clans.
Why did Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance comes from timing.
The mid-term elections were only five weeks away on November 6th – if it was as expected, the Republicans did not do well. They were significantly weakened in their efforts to get the people they wanted to be elected to the Supreme Court in the land.
George W. Bush picked up a phone call calling Senator Lobbying them to support Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s private secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes the report?
There are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently in the Senate.
It is not clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate floor, which will make Mik Pence the Vice President always dismiss and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean detainees 'declined' under Kim
The number of transplants from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of National Integration, said there were 1,127 shore changes in the previous year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said more strict border control between North Korea and China and higher smuggler capture rates were key factors.
Pyongyang does not comment on any public opinion.
the South Korean Citizenship Proposal
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the DMZ with strong defenses between the two countries.
China is considered more illegal asylum-seekers than refugees and is often forced to repatriate.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is technically still in war - has improved sharply in the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks, focusing on the stagnant nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This comes after a historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when they agreed on a broad terms of nuclear-free entry into the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rei Young-ho accused the U.S. of lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way we can unleash our weapons first," Mr. Ree said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "a polygamist", saying he was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority council, called the nominee as a member of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, "a pessimist" and said that he was inappropriate because of a temperament to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking if a woman gestures out like that, they'll say 'feel like a tyrant'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Cavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh denies the allegations by emotion that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting out and choking while talking about his family and high school life.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, claiming the allegations against him as "a murderous and coordinated character" held by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Cavanaugh's statement had proven that he could not serve the Supreme Court because it showed that he had a prejudice against the Democratic Party.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and forms how he defeated Clinton and the Democratic Party," she said.
Pelosi questioned when asked if she would try to sue Cavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats had voted a large majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this—if he hadn't been telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he wasn't just inappropriate to be in the Supreme Court, but also to include in the courts he was in right now," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh currently is a judge on the D.C. appeals court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible diagnosis of the Health System Reform Law (ACA) or the Roe v. Wade case as he was considered a conservative justice.
In listening to his confirmation, Cavanaugh avoided the question whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's verdicts.
"It's not a time for a man who's hysterical and prejudiced to go to court and expects us to say 'How wonderful'," Pelosi said.
And women need to be armed.
It was a fair criticism, months of overwhelming anger, and she could not speak out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's wrong, do you think?"
She went on to say, "I've been greatly helped by some executive woman who says she's crying when she's angry, but has developed a technique which means that when she's angry and starts to cry, she's going to speak to the person she's saying, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I think that's great."
Tears are allowed as a solution for anger, partly because they are misunderstood in a fundamental way.
One of my sharpest memories from my early work in the workplace where men stand out, where I once found myself crying with an inexplicable anger. Is that I was grabbed at my neck by an older woman - the cold manager I always feared - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad as firewood as firewood.
They think you're sad and will be delighted because they beat you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart to run for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat called Monkey Business and bowed out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason she should not explore the idea of running for president himself.
"It's not a well-thought-out decision," she said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted was another one.
Some call it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it's the end of the campaign, she's behind fundraising, so she vows she won't participate unless she raises $2 million.
It's a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 to a man would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wonders.
When she made her speech, she announced she would not launch an official campaign. She was overwhelmed by emotions – thanks to people who would support her. The frustration with the system made it difficult to raise funds and target voters besides representatives and people who were angry about sexism – who choked her.
"You must think I'm nervous," Ms. Schroeder thought of how the media responded to her.
"You might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to inscribe on my gravestone?
"Are you crying?"
How U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Good for Beijing
The opening of the U.S.-China trade war is booming, and while the fight is far from over, the cracks between the countries may benefit long-term Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump launches its first warning early this year by imposing China's major export tariffs, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important leverage flows this week with a new tariff that affects USD 200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all U.S. imports from China.
Beijing has responded each time similarly. It has recently slapped the tariffs at a rate of 5 to 10 percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has pledged to fight the U.S., and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to blink at any time nearby.
Washington's weakening meant a dramatic reduction in demand, but the public bidding for the U.S. was too humiliating for China's president, Jinping.
Despite that, experts said that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, U.S. trade war pressure could support China in the long run by reducing cross-border dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that rapid political decisions in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that initiate economic control in both countries are actually much more dangerous than the previously recognized observers," said Abigail Grace, a research co-founder who focused on Asia at the new American security center, a working group that leveled it brains.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign ministers say
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to build a country devastated by a war that lasts for more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Walied Allam, the Foreign Minister, said the conditions within the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to progress in fighting terrorism," he said.
the Rehabilitation and Rehabilitation
Refugees leaving due to terrorism and one-party economic measures aimed at their daily lives and lifestyles.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mo'alem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in restoring the devastated country.
But he emphasized that it would not accept aid with conditions or assistance from countries that support such an insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive European Cups and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown, while Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mikaelson, a U.S. star who struggled in most tournaments, hit his T-off in the water at the Par 3 hole in the 16th, giving up his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his races by becoming one of the four players made 5-0-0 since the current form of the race began in 1979.
Jordan Speth, an American, was blown out 5&4 by the lowest player on the Danish team, Thorbjorn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top player, made 2 and 1 for Ian Poulter of England who might play in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Sergio Garcia, the Spanish rider who has had eight seasons in the Ryder Cup, became the top European tournament winner of all time with 25.5 points throughout his career (career point).
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
So thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I was very happy. Very happy to get the cup back.
It's all about the team and I'm glad I can help," said an overwhelmingly emotional Garcia after a European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot, John Rams, who overthrew the legendary U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I felt to defeat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career-high record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
Strange stats by one of the greatest players of all time by winning 14 big important items after just Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggles every weekend to find fairways with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finne, top golfers throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, U.S. captain, said after a disappointing play for his team, "I'm proud of them, they're done fighting.
There's some time this morning that we've put Europe in a state of chaos.
We're scraps now.
Thank you, Thomas.
He was a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Rider Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 men and I am proud to serve as captain.
You have to admit.
We're better played."
Redwater Updating: Reduced Concentration in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a typical decline in the concentration of the Redwater Range for some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, a small amount of flowering has been reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating a decreased concentration.
The flower ranges in red waters about 130 miles from the coast from Pinellas north to Lee County south.
It can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboro County, but it's less common compared to last week.
The Redwater period is also observed in Pasco County.
The moderate concentrations in or offshore of Pinellas County have been reported in recent weeks. The low to high concentrations offshore of Hillsboro County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations in or offshore of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in or offshore of Lee County and low concentrations in Collier County.
Irritation to the respiratory system is still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida over the past week.
