Members of the National Assembly of Wales concerned that they ‘will be compared with Muppets’
There is a stir among the Members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name may seem ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘rhythms on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for fools and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is ‘dissatisfied’ and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party is ‘open’ for the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: ‘It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.’
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the members of the National Assembly of Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the option MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach a consensus, and she will have to submit a bill on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly operates, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will finally be able to vote on their new title when they debate the legislation.
People of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change of their country's name
On Sunday voters will vote to change their country's name to 'Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve a continuing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that it would claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's requests to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, has said that he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say, however, that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells Saint Martin's silence, Harlem's are struggling
‘The older people I talked to said that there was a café and a church here in the past,’ said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to be seen here.'
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
‘People now have social contact in a different way’, he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people visit regularly.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of selling the assets of the churches will not last as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.”
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
‘The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘which will result in these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who are moving to these apartments will become members of the church community.’
Both churches were once built by a white church, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church church of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A nearby black church took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers on 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where black people could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when Reverend Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a carillon.
Father David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon 'the bells of the poor'.
The expert who played the carillon in July referred in a different way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carillon in the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would ‘want to pass on the cost’ to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese had sent.
Some parishioners complained about the diocese’s lack of transparency.
Shark injures 13-year-old diving to lobsters in California
Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends on Saturday about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others he paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that the boy called because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized that “the boy cried out, ‘I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His collarbone was completely open," saw Hammel as he approached the boy.
‘I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’’.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in mortal danger.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Beach watch Captain Larry Giles told in a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the neighborhood a few weeks before, but that it was then concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was severely injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and sets up beauty departments where specialist assistants work, such as in large stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops across the country. If they turn out to be a success, they will be introduced in even more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood, with other products.
Sainsbury's plans to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees is also given more space, with display space per brand, such as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique make-up back on the market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something younger shoppers increasingly demand.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first was opened in Croydon, in southern London, the second will be opened later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and increasingly buy small amounts of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more efforts to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the stores will look more and more like warehouses, now that the supermarket chain is up against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have yielded more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Pharmacy a makeover, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of the income from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 dispensaries in the shops three years ago sold £ 125 million to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: ‘We have completely changed the decor of our beauty department, so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way.'
Peter Jones "growling" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'furrying' because TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for True, their homewear and accessories brand.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is sometimes compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby, because she retired at the last minute from their profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was raging when Willoughby announced on Tuesday at a difficult meeting at the company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts (with a value of up to 1.5 million pounds) do not allow her enough time for True, their homewear brand and accessories.
The company is sometimes compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of an estimated £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his vacation rentals abroad.
One source said: ‘Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would secure its long-term future and yield enough for the next decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse at the main plant in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to major investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delayed.
And that could mean the end of years of friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 together with Capp, and Jones, 52, became Chairman of the company in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will soon be M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity program on the British channel ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: ‘We have no comment on his business affairs.’
Hard language ‘and then it was love between us’
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media for a remark he made that some people would find ‘inappropriate for a president’, and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I haven't given up anything."
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the decommissioning of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see an ‘agreemental response’ by the United States following North Korea’s initial disarmament initiatives.
In the meantime, the United States continues its sanctions to keep the pressure on the kettle, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
‘We’re doing very well in North Korea,’ he said.
‘We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we're having a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results, that the missile trials have ended, that hostages have been freed and that the remains of American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
‘It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, about 200 people would be standing here,’ Trump said, pointing to the audience before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok ran out of homes, no national disaster was announced, which is a prerequisite for launching international aid.
‘Unfortunately, in many cases, it is clear that they are not applying for international aid, which is difficult for us,’ said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain that the emergency workers from abroad can work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster relief agency, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very badly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide from tsunamis, but on other shores you rarely see them.
That there was no warning sirene for tsunamis in Palu, even though a warning was in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Also in ideal conditions it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's impoverished infrastructure was one of the key elements of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government is facing a lack of funding, and he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fought in the streets, with machetes, arrow and bow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge creates impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, when his team was 1-0 behind.
He tapped the ball to the left and then kicked in the direction of the furthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty range, towards the upper right corner of the net.
He avoided the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,’ said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and ventured an attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked the ball.’
Chelsea was at peace with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The lead of The Blues kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the midfielder to Liverpool's play area.
Kovacic did a quick one-two in midfield.
Then he gave a nice stabbing pass, which allowed Hazard to reach the penalty zone.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool plays at 3 p.m. on Wednesday in the Champions League against Napoli, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's taking it on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Tsunami death rate in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, said the national disaster relief agency Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 from last Friday, which also caused waves of 6 m high, spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, whereupon a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews on John Street, and the body showed stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking the locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has only just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they may have filmed something via a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The inhabitants are now told that it will be hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the scene.
She keeps saying, ‘What a shame!’.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the perimeter, and a third was just outside.
Within the perimeter, a number of officers were watching the apartment building.
Those who have information are asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, indicating log 247 of 30 September.
Statue of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' event
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as ‘fooster’ and ‘an attempt to rewrite history.’
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the vision of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a figure that, according to many, still needs recognition.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct performance is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered."
Homicidal pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to reports in local media.
The man, whose last name is ‘Yuan’ only known, was found dead in a stable on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His artery was pierced and he was covered in blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inoculate pigs at a pigsty, on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and turned out to be an open door to a neighboring pigsty.
According to the nephew, there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth in the pighouse.
A forensic study showed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
‘My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated’, said the cousin with the last name ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On surveillance camera footage, Yuan arrived on the market at 4.30 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police gathered evidence on the spot.
It is reported that Yuan’s family and market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, which seriously injured the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - kg pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
When a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer at CBC News testified that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
‘They’re just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they're not looking to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the US
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening now that she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest in the next few days.
With a wind speed of 135 km/h, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 p.m. on Sunday morning and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will take 10 centimetres of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture reacting with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause precipitation from 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
There is expected to be up to 5 to 10 cm of rain in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as the tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised not to go into the desert on foot when the tropical rains threaten.
The heavy rains can turn ravines into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small debris streams and slippery roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall during the rainy season.
Spread tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rain will spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate strongly, as the Arctic becomes cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the ongoing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and east of the US, October is expected to start warm, with temperatures fluctuating around 30°C everywhere, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees hotter than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that until mid-October the odds are high at above-average temperatures in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched one of the six television networks watching the poignant testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault reportedly taking place in the 1980 ’ s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday's surprise: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Arizona senator, to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she's 100 percent sure a drunk Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in an animated testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen probably looked at Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for the other networks that sent out the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking into an office.
By comparison, that's pretty much like for a play-off of a football game or for the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which fully supports the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, CNN and CBS' cameras recorded on Friday morning that protesters yelled at him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He stayed with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being reviled, live on CNN.
‘I’m right here in front of you,’ said one woman.
‘Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted: ‘You have power, while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and closed right before the elevator, he added that he would say more at the hearing.
The various channels broadcast everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote for it on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by next week, something the Democrats of the minority insist on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticised her plans to leave the European Union of ‘a political game’ with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives for the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s taxes was ‘absurd’.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of manslaughter, said Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police questioned Simpson and later declared that he had confessed to shooting Wayde, resulting in his death.
His bail is set at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The county coroner in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and locals all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for their ‘set on and strive for justice.’
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was in shock due to Waydes' death.
‘This is an event you always hope will never happen’, Wade says.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico City
The ashes spewed out by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater was picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected several drums and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 on the Richter scale hit central Mexico.
The volcano, called ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists were beaten by the riot police, while thousands participated in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia, which divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the riot police threw eggs and powder paint at the cops, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, skirmishes broke out with the police, and the officers pulled out their bat to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive’, while their opponents shouted ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, reported the local press.
Tensions continue to increase in the independence-minded region, one year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters spoke overwhelmingly to become independent, although the turnout was low and the people who oppose secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region, resulting in violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot the night of Friday on Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s prospects for independence.
‘Last year we experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was close, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success, since many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity pending a trial of their role in organising the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
‘The tensions are increasing’, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional custody since the end of last year, declared that he is taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
‘A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to challenge the deterioration of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government,’ he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after home was rammed with a car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed at a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent around 7.30 p.m. on Thursday.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves had suffered damage.
A crossbow may also have been fired on the car at some point.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came at an equal level with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed this season to win an away game during the Premiership. They have to compete against leader Hearts on Sunday, who has eight points ahead of them.
But first the Rangers receive Rapid Vienna Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston remains undefeated. The team has already won six consecutive games in his division, and Coach Holt has not suffered any defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston lacks opportunities against strong visitors
The Holt team could have achieved a head start long before the first goal. Their direct way of playing caused all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal, and then Alan Lithgow, who caught Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball above the target.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances calmly and confidently.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston created an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty zone.
At that time the Rangers had been holding ball for a long time, but the defense of the home team was unmistakable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made Kelly avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball against the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a lead by his colleagues from Livingston.
All the time, they've reached Livingston's penal territory, but they've been barred every time, and twice a penalty kick was denied, one after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's 'Phenomenal' - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has hardly changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has worked up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall ran on the tops of their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were unable to break through.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only managed once to break the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a shining blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to Berlin for breakfast on Saturday (29 September).
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne for the opening of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering for the mosque, but many sympathizers came close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also voiced their voices, condemning Erdogan's policy as well as the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics were present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were in the process of identifying the man and informing his immediate family.
The road is closed at different places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six guards injured in disturbance of order
Six guards were injured in a disturbance in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out at approximately 9.30 p.m. local time on Sunday in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ guards have been deployed to solve the situation, involving eight prisoners in one department.
The guards were treated there for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: ‘Specially trained prison staff have been deployed for a topical incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may need to stay behind bars for longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin there are over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the hospital prison had been treated after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to prison for a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with potentially positive effects on drought areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, because hurricane Rosa's remaining energy is moving across the southwest of the desert region, which poses risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday. Monday night it will rain already.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.'
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there 10 cm is possible.
Rosa's rain can be a blessing for areas that are not at risk of flooding, because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of these rainfalls are likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map showing current drought areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa's trajectory reaches the mainland via the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at 20 km/h.
The storm strikes cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, watering them down.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
Heavy rain may fall in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant flood risk.
‘Drop of a total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa travels north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday in the early morning hours as a tropical depression, which then leaves for Arizona on Tuesday evening and goes to the south of Utah.
‘The greatest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert region’ said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old male were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton at about 4 p.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is ‘stable’.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed anything of what happened to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has suffered under the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
'A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party', Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure Kavanaugh has constantly 'suffered under the commonwealth, the anger' of the Democratic Party
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified to Congress and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the ‘American people’ saw Kavanaugh’s beautiful and incredible character, quality and courage that day.
‘A voice to acknowledge Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognizes one of the most accomplished legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record,’ he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
‘In five weeks’ time, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part," he said.
‘That's why I'm all about great candidates.’
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to 'resistance and hinder us'.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a top GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and tolls are rising
In a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, with many wiped off the ground when giant waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six meters high hit the shore at the moment it began to twilight. Many people crashed and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They didn’t just walk away and thus became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian office for assistance in natural disasters BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on land,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On aerial photographs released by the office for assistance in natural disasters, it can be seen that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been twisted and collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday the coastal city continued to quake through aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released in the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the force of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima during World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He said that some of the fatalities were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, about 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala ‘is completely flat, we have no information at all’, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,’ said the Red Cross.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday for not saying that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, one can hear a man on the upper floor of a building screaming in panic at people on the street below to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters couldn't verify the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened for relief only and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
While the staff of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office seek shelter in tents of tarpaulin, Doseba said, but passed scenes of destruction along the way.
‘They told me that they saw many houses that had been destroyed,’ he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid workers with a high level of expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
‘It’s still a disaster at provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says: ‘O.K., this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.’
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and relatives of the missing continued to hope that they would find their loved ones alive, as in the miracles that people so much like to belong to terrible natural disasters like this.
Saturday a boy was taken from a sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi.
‘As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,’ he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread in the paragliding community and that in the following hours he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one grey checker appeared instead of two blue checkers.
‘I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,’ he said.
Thieves steal 26,750 dollars during ATM supplies in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole 26,750 dollars from a Brink employee filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had just emptied an ATM into the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, according to Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many persons were involved in the incident.
If you have any information on the identity of the perpetrators, please contact Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter, saying: ‘The creature formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while now and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the creator of the show.
Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current stage name. Earlier West told us that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you', West said earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album at radio host Big Boy.
‘So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
I switched from Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are.'
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has already worked with and without the hyphen and the capital letters.
Mexican president promises not to use forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would ‘never use military force to suppress the Mexican people.’
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people, during which time left-wing student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and a shortage of opportunities to study.
United States should double funding for A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States has to double the amount they spend on research by A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this following the announcements about A.I. coming from different departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be the number one in the field of A.I. innovations by 2030.
‘Doubling the budget for research into A.I. would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.’, Lee said.
A doubling of funding may lead to a doubling of the chances that the next major achievement for A.I. will take place in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later he was manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, as it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
‘China does not steal our best academics, the companies do so’, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best universities to work on A.I. in recent years.
Lee said that American efforts in A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
‘He who doctorates in the field of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card’, he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to academic institution staff, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve industry and academia partners in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Limited Committee for Artificial Intelligence).
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than 100 million dollars in research into A.I.
However, the US legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national security committee on artificial intelligence has been in the throes of months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change of their country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country’s name to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’, which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been dragging on for decades and would no longer hinder Greece’s Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, which says that the name of its northern neighbour means that it claims to be in Greek territory, and Greece vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and because of a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required turnout of at least 50% will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot has been put as follows: ‘Do you support membership of NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the price to be paid is worth trying to join institutions such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia disbanded.
‘I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,’ said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said that there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at that time was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
‘I came to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people boycotting the referendum.
‘We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a loophole, Kavadarkov said.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will generate much-needed investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after his vote.
He said that a ‘yes’ as a result would be ‘a confirmation of our future’.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of that, 70% would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short cuts in the defense of Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the race with 2-0.
It seemed like a piece of cake, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian focus was first played on the midfielder.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, right into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others on the edge of Brighton's penal territory.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
‘Aguero has problems with his feet,’ said coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City to the press.
‘We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playing field.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player tapped into the ball just before he got too far.
City will take it on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The competition will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play along and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Nevertheless, the ever competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the play-off. They currently lead one game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least a wildcard for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now want to do everything in their power to ensure their first division title.
‘Although there is nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on Sunday’s move, but are reportedly inclined to establish Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was going to start his 34th, was in the pitching field on Thursday and would pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke about the importance of the Republican turnout in the mid-election.
‘Everything we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I don’t participate, but actually I do participate. That’s why I’m standing up for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take power back, no matter what they have to do for it.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to push away to gain power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resistance and hinder us."
‘And we’ve seen that in the last four days,’ he said, calling the Democrats ‘evil and mean and false and lying’.
He mentioned the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is on the Senate Justice Committee, which led to loud noise from the public.
‘Do you remember what she answered?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour MEPs who got that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the censorship motion because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: ‘We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.’
And that was also the case during most of the GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am already a local Labour MEP.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a more ‘nicer, softer’ politics has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a disagreement is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political outlook to my own, suddenly expected that I would turn around and take a position that I would never have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak for an audience, no matter what I say, there are abuses on social media calling for my candidacy to be rejected as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, condemning the politics of the Centre and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who every day have to deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions, but are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that it seems that bad abuses are considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with any ‘motion of distrust’ or change of selection rules the party becomes more petty.
For the past two years, I have often been advised to lay low, not just to express my opinion loudly and then I would ‘not get in trouble’.
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined Labour as a school child 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally caused my classroom to collapse, I have always argued for better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a city councillor and in my role as a minister.
I never hid my politics, even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr on his way to the top
Two late try's may have slightly distorted the end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr is rightfully triumphing in this wonderful competition of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the rankings, the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end it was both their superior defense and their better chances that gave the home team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
‘We’ve had a hard time so far during our games and we’re still undefeated, so I’m a happy man’, he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: ‘All credit to Ayr, they have made better use of their opportunities than we have.’
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, finished by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but a yellow card by Rory Hughes from the Scottish national team (which he got during the Warriors' game) allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot managed to break down a try.
Climo gave Ayr an extra lead with a penalty and scored a conversion after a solotry just before the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was held for a long time for a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who was dropped off on a stretcher, and as soon as the match was restarted, Ayr could continue with a try by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion by Climo.
Then captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card from Ayr, and again Melrose took care of the extra man when no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tackled Climo without the ball, MacPherson behind the advancing Ayr-moul made for a touch-down on the penalty-line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick from David Armstrong and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the fifth try of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going into the hospitality business. Apparently, he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craig.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the ‘blowing restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the land-locked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigging naval office in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag flying on public buildings.
On all the naval bases of Lake Titicaca up to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout the country-circled Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country had to surrender to Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century conflict of raw materials is still vivid, as is the desire to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should fall on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
‘Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, looks forward to the result with positive prospects’, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the Court's ruling on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will plead in favour of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of tough talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, much is at stake with the verdict of Monday.
‘We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,’ he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the authority to grant Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the closing statement indicates that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, in the last four years the situation has perhaps even worsened.
‘The matter of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,’ Zárate said.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has completely undermined all the goodwill that Chile might still have had, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to continue talking after this.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other's countries since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will ‘be given an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile’ and an opportunity to ‘put an end to 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits’, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
‘Bolivia will never give up his right of access to the Pacific Ocean,’ he added.
‘The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to put the past behind us.’
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time when Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's a 'utopia' that the continued sanctions and the US objection to a declaration to end the Korean war will one day bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking important steps in disarmament first.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious when he says that he would abandon an arsenal that probably sees the country as his only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headgear, for sale soon near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your sight, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were hard to imagine from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their dazzling creations onto the catwalk.
Valentino's striking piece was a giant beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, hanging over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons lined with gemstones, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were sewn shut. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're lucky.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats are perhaps inspired by 'La Bomba', the scattering hat with a two meter wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also created another great creation on the catwalk: a scattering beach bag that was almost as big as the model in bathing suit that sucked the bag.
The red orange raffia bag, deposited with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community-wide initiatives.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for secondary and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desired subjects par excellence within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and a relationship of trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated to SCIS, shows that 72 percent of the students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students in German, 69 percent of the students in French and 63 percent of the students in Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now as much valued as trade choice as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the obstacles to filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are thus becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
As more and more job vacancies require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language that stood above 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Speaking several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specialising in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied at present that languages in a global business environment remain vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut on Sunday at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for the first game of LeBron James at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game for the season.
It still has to be determined how many minutes he'll play.
‘There will be more than one, and less than 48,’ Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week James was asked about his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six games prior to the season.
‘At this stage of my career, I don’t need competitions before the season to prepare me,’ he said.
Trump election rally period in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a long series of election rallys tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallys in the coming week, including stops in places he'd like, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been put on hold, Trump wants to build up support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time does Trump's rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about the hearings for candidate-initiator Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were extra loaded now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may be waiting for a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more momentum.
President Trump's campaign leadership said that these five rallys are meant to ‘encourage volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives’, Reuters says.
‘Control of Congress is so important to his program, that the president travels to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins’, said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that did not want to be named against Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is left behind in the polls.
‘It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the polls,’ said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging garland of opportunities is a completely invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So who's getting the best chances at the moment?
‘They had a six-point lead at first, and now that’s only four more, so we find that luck is on our side at the moment’, said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of being four points ahead, while there are twelve more in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and scored three points each of the four.
Spieth has been a fearsome opponent from tee to green and he sets a good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he realized a crucial putt that made game four a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His putt with which they won the match at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can derive that he believes that the American team has not yet been defeated.
‘You have to dig deep and worry about your own game’ Spieth said.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to make your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
This curious, but delicious European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players who have to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to win a European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short cuts with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swede that they couldn't overcome.
Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
The European team has played best so far and has a good lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to take the fight, something some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday they are ahead of the United States with 10-6.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had a hard time, giving them a four-point lead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points at the 12 singles games on Sunday in order to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed ‘Molliwood’, are only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening matches after a sensational weekend.
After they hit Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully matched and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a wonderful move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Yet it was not a shambles for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze to the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
After a difficult match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls, they later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has managed to catch up with a four-point lag at the beginning of the singles, although Furyk's team has had enough of a tie, as they currently hold the trophy.
But now that they've been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says that it will ‘under no circumstances’ unilaterally disarm without confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions are leading to increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could under no circumstances unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Assembly that over the past year North Korea had taken ‘significant goodwill measures’, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the site for nuclear testing and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
‘However, we do not see a similar reaction from the US’, he said.
‘Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will under no circumstances unilaterally disarm ourselves.’
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took further steps, it was noted that he did not a priori disapprove of unilateral denuclearisation, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work towards the ‘denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea’s security.
North Korea is aiming for a formal end to the Korea war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on ‘denuclearisation first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war’, said Ri.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an aircastle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions only strengthen our mistrust.'
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader suggested earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the other party had been South Korea on this issue of denuclearisation and not the USA, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the US mainland would be targeted after ‘Mr Evil President’ Trump Kim called a ‘missileman’ on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim this year at the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much remains to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea denuclearises.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: ‘The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be vigorously and firmly continued until we have achieved the full, definitive, verified denuclearisation.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously implemented sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making 'gangsterlike demands'.
This month, during a meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took ‘consistent action’.
He said that Kim had told him that the ‘corresponding measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor noted that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course. As far as he knows, it is unique in the US.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a speech on the influence of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I only getting to hear this in my senior year?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which will be organized for the first time this year, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was established that students had a serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, students see an image of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine when going to sleep.
In another part, participants are told how long - term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a map of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
‘We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know all this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of choosing cigarettes on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride on a night of study still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, of good quality, must be the ‘secret weapon’ of the student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant hunger feeling.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course, after all, he had taken lessons with the professor last year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not just an alarm to stand up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, which can make you difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to destroy Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their breakout game again disappointing when Dolly scored Menga and defeated Steven Gerrard's weak team with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during an away game since they defeated St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team defeated, barely the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 games. His team is now eight points behind Hearts, which continue at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers are now dropping to sixth place, Livingston rising to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers might get into even more trouble, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently an object was thrown at him by the supporters of the visitor team.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team. They crossed Ayr and went to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same team for Livingston, who managed to cut off the Hearts last week. He would have been thrilled by the way his well-trained team managed to block off the opponents at each move.
The Rangers may have had most of the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga dropped the ball off for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in his sights, but the midfielder couldn't finish.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked the rear pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a happy ending rather than really believe in it if they could approach the target.
Alfredo Morelos found that he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless collided after fifteen minutes of play, but referee Steven Thomson waved away the request of the Colombian.
The Rangers could only shoot to the target twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who used to be a goalkeeper at the Ibrox, could easily stop Lassana Coulibally's headball and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in line with the general course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was only because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to cope with the deep pattern of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who easily kicked the ball into the target.
Gerrard interrupted the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent switch. This move had almost immediate consequences when the winger passed Morelos, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play a kind of game that Livingston prefers to play, where Lithgow and Halkett keep kicking long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final stage of the game, but McGregor held up well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invader Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a penalty kick after a collision with Jacobs at the end of the game, but Thomson looked the other way again.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for those who can TELL well... the day on which future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has not been able to think away from science, and also became an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the initially unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘That’s a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you hear the effect of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.'
Evans: ‘It’s really banging now!’
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, barely a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.

The method removes immune cells in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted so that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which often occurs in all kinds of cancers. Then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way of removing immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ these cells to tackle cancer cells has already been shown to work in the treatment of a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanye West stands out pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA hat after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't work out the way he hoped.
Kanye West was jolted out on a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an incoherent performance in which he praised American President Donald Trump and said he would be running for president in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he tiraded against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
‘Often when I talk to a white man, he asks: ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump? He’s a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony on the Senate Justice Committee in connection with the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford accuses him of.
West's tirade was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded them to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to make fun of West with his mail.
West also complained to the public that he had been attacked backstage for his hat.
‘They harassed me backstage.
They said, "Don't step on the stage with that hat."
They taunted me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see what apathetic looks like?’ He said he would put on her superman cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
According to Variety, at least twice in the audience came out and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed. The magazine was told by one present: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.’
West was a guest as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier-bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest minds: CONCERNS THAT YOU ARE TROTTING THE MASSA.’
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just ‘just himself, and that's beautiful.'
‘But I choose not to reward someone who supports and spits out an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do what he wants.
So did we', added them.
Before the show started, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘the creature formally known as Kanye West’.
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg also wore the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then into The artist formally known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Police Court on Monday.
The charge will be investigated by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington turns to toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor turns to the stereotype of the macho hero and says that young boys often think that when they see such roles on the screen they have to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks that ‘something has gone wrong’ and asked himself how to address the problem of toxic manhood in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
'This is really an important question for me personally at the moment: where did our masculinity go wrong?' he said.
"What have we learned from men when they grew up, which now confronts us with this problem?"
Kit thinks television might be partly responsible for the increase in toxic manhood, due to its very male characters.
He continued: ‘What is innate and what has been taught?’
What is taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they have to be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's big questions: how do we change that?
Because something has obviously gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the show is over next summer, because he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
From November, Kit will play in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he feels that his encounter with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the show, so that's how I left my future family and my life to it from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded with an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that over 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
Hiv has spread rapidly in the past in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
According to studies, the conservative values of the country suggest that an estimated 70 to 90% of men having sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member leaked data from Republican senators and turns to ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘conplot theories’
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters contradicts the allegations that one of her staff members has posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of lawmakers.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the accusations are spread by ‘extreme right’ know-it-alls and websites.
‘Lies, lies and even more vicious lies’, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and telephone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill at a Senate Committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and contained the information of a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," Waters said.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security are compromised due to these false allegations, was under no circumstances responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
Waters' statement quickly came across criticism online, among other things by former White House press officer Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds angry’, Fleischer wrote.
‘From this you can see that she does not have the temperament to be Congressman.
If someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He shouldn't question the prosecution's motives.
He must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the mid-elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
‘Heavily, if it is true’, he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators become known’, she said, ‘and that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff members.’
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that does indeed apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a weak spy in the lead, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back into existence in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this light-hearted even being about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with bulging eyes and flexible facial features at least manages to send everything in a hundred, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already conclude that he is a general comic character that was conceived for cinemagoers in countries where people speak a language other than English.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a hint of that guy who contributed one note to the theme song of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man Atkinson once played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (who everyone has forgotten by now) who always leaves behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved the way Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades tap his helmet.
In this film, Atkinson can clearly show how talented he is for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and oddly excessive, especially now that the "serious" series of films like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humour seems more intended for children than for adults, and the mad disaster of Johnny English is less original and focused on me than the jokes without text by the character Bean who plays Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all the active secret agents of Britain known, to the great dismay of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop in the bucket of the Prime Minister, a pretentious woman with problems on her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that reminds me of Teresa May, but the script doesn't offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisors, she has to deploy a retired spy, since every active spy has been compromised.
And that means the stunting Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a fancy institution, but gives unofficial lessons on undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spy classes of English remind of School of Rock.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic sidekick Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a tumultuous and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssey of cheesy crazy fun: dressed as waiters they set fire to a showy French restaurant, they make noise on board Volta's luxury yacht and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all registers are opened, but no matter how well-meaning and boisterous the scene is, she reminds a bit of children's television.
It's all not very original.
And like the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour denies that the party is coming up with a plan where British people work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan whereby British workers work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
It is reported that the party would want corporate bosses to pass on the savings they make as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to shift the country's balance sheet towards the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was already approved by the Trade Union Confederation, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits in with the party's efforts to make the balance in the economy more effective for the benefit of the workers and that also fits in with the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in the national election campaign of 2017.
However, the aim is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "A four-day working week is not the party's policy plan, nor is it considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the faceless drivers and the profiteers at utilities.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, because a Labour government could apply 'discounts' based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the boards of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) to give 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the FBI's findings could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview that will be broadcast at 60 Minutes on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that might change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be unstoppable.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will take place and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international advocators who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
Concertgoers who want to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call or in another meaningful way raising awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 more years to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just another form of 'click-tivism', giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters have been registered, targeting a large number of different targets.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to the commitment of world leaders and to policy proposals worth more than $37 billion to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or brought together by sponsor actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the main declarations of intent are those of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children realise their full potential'. This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, of donors, of other national governments and of Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice that is malnutrition a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government has announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website that asked "why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group replied: "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes falling and failing.
But, like civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will ultimately be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will be performing this year at the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian exports of energy - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington may 'if necessary' resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, stated Ryan Zinke, the US Home Secretary, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has this opportunity, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for invited guests during an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that posters itself as the 'voice of the energy consumer' in the US.
He went further and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these do not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less using and replacing fuels," he said, and referred to Russia as a country that has only one 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that offers by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw sight from the 'unfit' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which according to Berlin's Trum made Moscow's 'prisoner'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the strong opposition of Washington to the project is driven only by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about it' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator said on Saturday that she was "thinking seriously" about taking part in the presidential election after the mid-term election.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the election.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to repair the damaged government, and this also means that a woman is in the top position" she said according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren ran against President Donald Trump during the meeting at the town hall and said he "directed this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is bringing about in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this."
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters feel that she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not stand for election, according to an opinion poll conducted by the Political Research Center of Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent were in favour of running.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of leading Democrats associated with a possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSD of Track Palin at an election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"Due to what my own son is going through, what he's going through now that he's back, I understand other families who are suffering the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience that was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and have become harder, they come back and wonder if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the homeland".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesperson in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal protest against a new US policy refusing asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. submitted a statement to the Washington Court last Friday as a 'friend of the Court' in support of an asylum seeker challenging this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs Sessions case that the American Civil Liberation Union filed against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that American officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was then detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people apply for asylum in the US, as countries with major problems in gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals from 2014, in which it became possible for immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "has been ignoring state, federal and international law for decades".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is stated in the statement of the 'friend of the Court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy which deprives immigrants of access to the US harms the US economy, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and provide the country with the necessary labour force.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political view," said Sessions in its announcement of 11 June of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if these problems are serious, which people face every day, all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also got worse.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, trying to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed homes and searched in their wet possessions for valuables that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and hospitals have been overcrowded, as long as they have not been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told of his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remains of a wall," said Haris to a correspondent of the Associated Press and added that he was in town with his family for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her or to our child.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of the United States accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper, which praised the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump recently referred to China Daily's paid attachment in the Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections of November 6, an accusation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere with the US elections marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed ever higher import tariffs on each other.
China's retaliation rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, who support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and previously Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in a Sunday opinion paper in Des Moines Register, "now doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses freedom of expression and a free press, a long-loved tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a newsstand in the centre of Beijing, you will find in vain deviating voices and you will not see a true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese population may have on the difficult economic trajectory, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish its article" if he did not say which newspaper this was.
By the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans alienate female voters just before the mid-elections, analysts warn
As many major Republicans gather around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts warn that this will lead to a setback, especially among women, during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this subject have gone up enormously and most Republicans have already announced that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if Senator Jeff Flake (Republikeen, Arizona)'s attempt to plead for an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to satisfy the angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they haven't forgotten it tomorrow and they haven't forgotten it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday according to the Washington newspaper, D.C..
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate Hall while the Republicans who have the Justice Commission under control chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can increase even further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the President".
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she further explained her charge of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pushed the appointment through.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party chairman of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote on the committee, or the final vote or Kavanaugh taking place in court, but it's also about the way the Republicans handled this and how they treated her" makes Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clear to the news channel.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided on the question of who they believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority signing up for the latter.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony, or probably believe that 35 percent believe Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh certainly or probably lied during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's lead, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford, in front of the Senate Justice Committee, declared under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading idea behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored here.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment through data'.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to have conversations with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will completely turn all their business models upside down at once".
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and bearer of the Victoria Cross from World War I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a military man is honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel, Father Bernard Vann received the award following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had been given the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was 'brilliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather had been distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
He later rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward before running to a field gun alone and eliminating three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I can never match, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you stayed up all night watching a full-blown Bellator 206 and you don't get to see the most important moment.
On the San Jose bill, 13 battles were reported, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for their fight, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed awake all night just for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to government regulations, no content that is not suitable for children can be displayed after 6:00 a.m., and that's why we had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yesss."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they're going to change their programming to make sure that the viewers in the UK get a chance in the future as well.
"I think, in view of the return match, we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of text messages went back and forth and believe me, these weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise this won't happen again.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says that during his childhood he felt inferior because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary school, he didn't realize that 'not everyone is the way I am'.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne he said that he had spoken about gay rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that parenting had helped to reduce his appreciation for winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-term show has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first program, Daley told him that during his childhood he felt 'less' than others because it was 'socially not accepted to like both girls and boys'.
He said, "Until today, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was someone, so he wouldn't disappoint people if they eventually found out about his orientation.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, 'has completely surprised me'.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much so young", he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, you won't be there to sit in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I could finally acknowledge that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed of this my whole life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling" he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, that had greatly seized him on his way to the games and which still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on a bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find his shape in order not to turn it into a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participated for the 12th time in the biennial event, a record, was placed on the bench by the team captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing at the driving range, trying to figure out where it is going.
Because he was never known for his straight drives even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs erring balls routinely punishes.
And if the job itself is not terrifying enough, Mickelson will meet the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who is linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week in the ninth match on Sunday.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the start of the 12 single matches, start well, Mickelson's match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, although, frankly, it was difficult for him to do otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me in the back, put his arm around me and said he was ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of faith in himself.
He was recorded in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to only play two matches.
I expected more from it, but it's the way it is, and it's the way we had to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he never fully matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 match games in his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain untouchable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy to have on the team" he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to fool him once in a while last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big head start can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead prior to the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Dane made his debut in the match in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but eventually passed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big head start in Valderrama; we had a big head start in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just now," said Bjorn, calling off here, after he had seen the light of 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this isn't a game played yet.
Everyone will have to make a full commitment tomorrow.
Get back to work and do the right thing.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's winning this trophy, and we need to keep focusing on that.
I keep saying it, I focus on the 12 players we have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoiced with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never prejudge matters in this area.
Another challenge awaits tomorrow.
Tomorrow the individual achievements will be discussed, and that is yet another discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're alone, your abilities as a golfer are really tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he should get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this turnaround on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he replied in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had pep up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches ahead of us tomorrow, but let's try to get off to a good start, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We've tuned our line-up to this and we're going to send the men out in the order we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try and pull something out of the top hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counteroffensive and deploy Rory McIlroy for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered" said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been in service in 2014, replacing the outdated warships of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit that quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the outdated frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far away from home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its overseas power, are already obsolete by the time they are put into operation, notes Die Zeit.
The fateful frigate F125 already made the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would render the warship useless if it were deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the boats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is suffering from severe overweight, which will reduce performance and limit the capabilities of the Navy to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip are becoming extra important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Parliamentary Defence Commission in Germany, acknowledged that the Navy is in fact "a shortage of deployable ships".
The official said that the problem has grown over time as a snowball, because old ships were taken out of operation but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available for inclusion in the Navy.
National Trust tracks the secret life of bats
New research carried out on an estate in the Scottish Highlands, attempts to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the common and small dwarf bat, the brown large-ear bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NTS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the cries of the bat and what kind of what does it do.
A map of the habitat and a report is then produced to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation advisor, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making meadows and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have fallen significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping accommodations and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightnings can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
At the NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much about bats is not yet known, and that is why the work we do here and at other locations will help us to better understand what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance work was carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, possibly destroying a full local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or destroy their sleeping accommodations.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to contribute to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and of many of our species we simply don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects charges of sexual assault while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo's allegations of sexual assault qualified as fake news and said that people want to 'promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to charge the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the accusations have been published.
The peak of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 not to mention the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, mentioned the reports 'fake news' a few hours after the allegations were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by mentioning my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the business.
I'm a happy man, and by and by good," added the football player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they called 'unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the football player wants compensation for the "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, went back to the football player's room, where he sexually raped her according to the accusation, as can be read in the charges filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a '99 percent' good guy, but that he is sometimes abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was 'banged for the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants the scheme annulled because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged sexual assault and left for the Italian giant Juventus this summer in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' when car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its status as world leader in car production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory shut down," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other automotive products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the impact of a departure from the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The car manufacturers are most concerned about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby parts of suppliers arrive every 37 minutes in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be unrest at the borders that industry believes could lead to delays and shortages of components.
Toyota cannot store more than one day of stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be shut down in that case.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is 'exactly aligned to avoid border controls'.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue with this highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be shut down, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working for Burnaston for 24 years, and who represents the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A spokesperson of the government said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed 'another week' while the fight over the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump and Russia's assistants and possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The question of whether Trump is going to fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has been the subject of the Washington gossip machine for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to drop the president off via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors were circulating that he was about to file his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein 'liever', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week's investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday Sarah Sanders, Trump's press director, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters struggled with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by an aversion to the 'attractive' TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president does for him," she said, without providing any proof of this: "We have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot, and you've seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks, and that will replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week the president possibly demonstrated why, he made a frank and at times bizarre appearance for the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes a letter about Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the wish that they continue to work at the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish authorities have already declared their willingness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer the negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and that bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after having sustained head injury
The linebaker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation yesterday after having suffered a head injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tennessean reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and sort of collapsed there," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff immediately gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before they put it on him on a stretcher and took him for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that 'no details are yet known about the type/ extent of the injury' and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a red shirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was hit five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him a total of 18 battles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless according to new Conservative plans
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in fees is levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success that attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and to tell this to many earners.
The increase in fees is levied on non-taxed individuals and firms in the UK, with the additional revenue being invested in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current fees, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and houses purchased for the rental, can go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise to £120 million a year in this way.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which boosts prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foothold on the house ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become virtually 'ghost cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson argued for a reduction in the fees to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable houses in order to restore the 'housing charm' in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to expulsion 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister in restoring the British Dream, that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as simple for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of living without a roof over the head is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland."
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says it's his "ultimate ambition" to ever become Scotland's manager.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of resurrecting the club from the northeast of England, which is currently in third place in League One, at three points of first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership during the previous season.
"As a football player, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and with that the stocking was over," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a kid, I saw Scotland with my father often playing in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps on attracting me.
However, that possibility would only come if I were successful in managing a club."
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to be the successor of these established names at a large club, he had previously refused advances by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Good luck for me is currently measured by "can I have this club return to the Premier League?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not an easy task to achieve this, but I can't see myself as successful until I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months into the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he's now more comfortable than he ever did in his career as a football player with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads" he remembered from the moment he took over the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did quite well, I earned quite well and I have known a few reasonable highlights.
But playing football can be tough.
There are a lot of things you face weekly.
I still have that, given the stress and the pressure of the profession, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that it's really me, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in summer has increased the income of British pubs that have difficulty surviving, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw revenue increase by 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants were 4.8 percent less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, who collected the figures, said: "Constant sunshine and the fact that England participated in the World Championships longer than expected, meant that July showed a similar pattern to June, when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were now hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the turnover of restaurants in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverage sales performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also aimed at selling food members also of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drinking revenue was 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food revenue was 3 percent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors for sales in the entertainment market.
It is no surprise, therefore, that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a turnover fall of 4.8 percent year-on-year is particularly painful given the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food operators and only the time will tell if the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary respite."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sectors, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five kids has a secret social media account that they keep hidden from their parents.
One in five children, some no older than 11 years, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey among 20,000 high school students revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a 'main account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, some no more than 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey among 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean 'main account' that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally ended up on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who asked others to 'rape' her.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to keeping personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are lured to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish athletics council
Eilith Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletics council, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and chairman Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the directors of the sport to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her election to the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terribly hard work, but I am now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for your support!"
Advertisement for breast pump comparing mothers to cows distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has divided online opinion with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers with cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, producer of consumer technology, has issued an ironic, music videos-inspired advertisement to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to bubbling mothers.
Four real moms dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything of it' and 'In case you didn't notice, these are not udders, these are my breasts'.
The chorus then continues with: 'Pomping, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies'.
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has immediately created an online controversy.
The video has been watched 77,000 times and has provoked hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that it condones the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of childbirth" is written in a reaction.
Elvie’s breast pump discreetly fits into a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else remarked: "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was 'hilarious'.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
Those pumps made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little weird, but I didn't think about it too much.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following remark: "This is a funny advertisement, aimed at moms who are cuddled (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like 'cows'.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you can see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who are humming sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and discreetly fits into a dietary bra, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they're at it.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between cooping mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the coop and the challenges involved in the spotlight and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will create an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children tacitly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump government make it more difficult to accommodate children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid of jeopardising their own chances of staying in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their household should issue their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albience, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before the Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no prior record.
"Almost 80 percent of the sponsors' sponsors or family members are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
We're in the process of prosecuting these people," said Mr. Albience.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules, forcing some of them to appear in court within one month of the start of detention, rather than within 60 days, which was the standard earlier, according to the staff at the shelter.
Many of them will be in court through a video conference, rather than in person, to plead their application for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may give rise to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to the shelter staff and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are often ignored, because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for this or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the 'occupational force' of the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'this will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue with "this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "possible illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are mainly training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he accused 'some Western countries of spreading irrational fears' which kept most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They're politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the United Nations say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has averted a massive attack from Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement had 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who 'will be eradicated'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN delegate, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions of the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to reviewing the articles of the current constitution' and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely by a deposition procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of viewing fatigue.
Since 2014, the ratings at CNN during prime-time have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime-time, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the person responsible for the ABC drama 'Designated Survivor', a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why?
"He then said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can influence Roe v. Wade’s future or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen, when you notice that you have been watching for six hours a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who talk about Paul Manafort's jacket of paucus leather that cost $15,000 ('a garment full of hubris' according to The Washington Post) and who discuss the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
At least I'll never be able to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"What he does to give you the idea that it's a reality show, is partly that he stops you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (combing with the N.F.L., offering Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you feel like you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't tear himself off the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember doing all these weird shows not so long ago, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Outside money flows in the most exciting interim elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an influx of money, thanks to a reshuffle of a constituency that requires two sitting representatives to fight for the same seat.
The recently reclassified district of Pittsburg affects the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb has to take on another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymandering') in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a fight in the field of campaign funding between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a well-viewed special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district with 20 percentage points difference.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China and abandoned it.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the United States Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the state ministry spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
But punishments were only considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in US aid in 2017, to control narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference, focusing on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from leaving for the United States.
But in mid - September some government top officials announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence will give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three American envoys have returned without further ado to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without harsh messages about Washington's sanctions.
A spokesman for the White House on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report of the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which heavy evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller will probably also focus his research on collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes colour, Trump has to answer to that institution, just as he is getting ready to turn to the voters again, and perhaps he has to answer to a jury in a court of law.
That is a lot of grounding, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
Choices will have to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, who will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938 German officers were ready to carry out a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and had supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and therefore missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of bending, and this accelerates or slows down the inexorable advance of democracy.
Americans are currently confronted with a variety of such bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this magazine reported that, last year, he had suggested secretly recording talks with the President and that he had speculated on the suitability of the President for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report isn't right.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me away, 60 years later, to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika is depicted.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the game against Rapid Wien
Rangers get Rapid Wien to visit on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a knee injury, the midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game of the season until the 2-2 tie at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but seen all over the game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it's going to be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last game. But if the audience stands behind us, I'm sure we can push through and we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been tough, of all that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feelgood factor at the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave the last season behind and be successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in Nationwide's research said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps necessary to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president for life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where we're gonna start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not make your wishes known properly in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices may be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take in a financial advisor: Your advisor can also advise you on how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or deploy equity as insurance as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when the insurance has to be used.
Provide a health care proxy so you can identify a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals abide by your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can't do this yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Record these details in a written plan, so you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes along."
Man shot several times with air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'random act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
As the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected by tsunamis over the last 100 years, according to the Agency for the Fight against Disasters of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on north Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coasts, more than half of which were in Aceh.
2005: A series of major earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a power of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the Richter scale hit the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded around 300 human lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destruction of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings crashing down.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's eldest son, former governor of Alaska, and vice-presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition during the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female confessed tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su custody house with a bail of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, for sure' when asked to do so, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He's also charged with a class B violation, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
This case is now for the Alaskan vets' court.
In January 2016, he was accused of a domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD, which he would have survived his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-on- Richter earthquake has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been shut down while the death toll is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake took place just next to the centre of Celebes, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, killing eight people, a rare sentence that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, was charged with using a rented truck from Home Depot to launch an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he knocked down pedestrians and cyclists who got on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'intentionally' killed the eight victims and 'intentionally' inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the letter of intent demanding the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury has approved the indictment of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder on behalf of a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and they described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'cruel, cruel and depraved'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellaevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the letter of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than ten years since the Southern District of New York had a case in which the death penalty was demanded.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted two years earlier of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by means of the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He let the detectives know he felt good about his act, she told the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, told the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the indictment of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life sentence without release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," said Patton.
Sajpov's defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MEP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Today Nigel Farage promised to mobilise a 'people's army' during a protest at the conference of the Conservative Party.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians should feel the 'heat' of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants in the Birmingham march that the UK would have been 'out already' if Mr. Farage Brexit minister had been.
But the challenge facing May in reconciling the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while this is being attacked by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Supporters insisted that she will continue and will try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw Chequers into the trash basket.
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were to call the shots, we'd be out by now," Bone said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers in the wastebasket."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
Conservative Brexite Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a targeted message for May, she added: "Primemen keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians need to feel the heat if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we won't let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to set fire to our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilise the people's army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and closed this march with a two - hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the founding of this group on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Higher House, made jokes about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "think well" about candidacy for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll "go and think about her candidacy for presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told us about her future at a meeting at a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican delegate who co-chaired Trum's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
An attending asked her if she would run for president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our faulty government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after shooting Wayde Sims of LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported Saturday that a suspect was arrested after shooting Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and died from the consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and confessed to being present at the crime scene, in possession of a firearm and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incident and is being held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory after team orders
When Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits and made Hamilton drive in the crowd in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came up again after a wheel-on-wheel action which made the Ferrari driver reluctantly release space on the inside after a double movement in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was the leader of the race for a long time, because he stayed on his tire selection and aimed for a fast finish, so that he could catch up with Kimi Raikonen for fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round he went to the pits, he couldn't raise his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen was fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri spent the whole weekend doing his best, and he was a real gentleman and he let me pass.
The team has worked so hard for the seats one and two" said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday about the fact that she persisted in not being the source of Christine Blasey Ford's leaked letter, accusing the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he indicated that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be 'meaning, unkind and untrue'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that takes place in the Senate these last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and unkind and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say, "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer... did you leak the document - 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't leak," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter stating the allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her desk was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to deal with it confidentially, and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president turned out not to believe her denial and he commented on it during the Saturday evening meeting: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Further in his defense of the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to seize power with all necessary means.
You see the meanness, the unkindness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to seize power and regain control" the president would have said according to Mediaite's report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars versus Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals leading by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team along before Dwyer put the Giants back in charge.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make up for a backlog on Friday night and then beat Dundee by 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The opening goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m. on an assist by Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants with a head start took the first rest, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team got back together and Bouchard brought them back to an equal position with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He made the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, making sure hundreds can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday, an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild and again moving traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's Flight 6321, which was ready at that time on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll may rise to thousands, and the country’s disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of six metres destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is engaged in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the military present: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, with more than 550 people dying.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one more man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with the local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and the crew after the plane was launched during the landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what the exact sequence of events is remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane was shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he himself and some others managed to wade through the water that came to their means to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head wound.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors working in the vicinity at a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by bringing people to the coast with an inflatable boat, before the plane sank further into the about 30 - meter [30 m] deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last twenty years 111 people have died in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG, but none of them relate to Air Niugini.
Analyst records the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed his requisition on Friday in the reopened trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a few hours of testimony as a witness expert on information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he used cell phone call records to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received the location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police again started talking to Sanford.
Sanford was on the stand on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the D.A. asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he told him he was at Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "logging because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told us that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis erased the texts, calls, and contact details of his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hip-hop'?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argue that hip-hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hip-hop' again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had another revival in Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A nanny from New York sues a couple for a 'racist' text
A nanny from New York sues a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving an incorrectly sent text in which the mother complained about 'again such a black one'.
The couple denies being racist and calls the trial extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a black woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
'NOWAY AGAINST ZWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the American newspaper The New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs Maurice when she realized her blunder. She stated that their previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a workday and was then sent home in a taxi.
Now Maurice takes the couple to court to get a compensation of $350 a day for the 6 months she was hired to attend the family internally, although without contract.
'I want them to feel that you just don't do something like that', says Maurice in the New York Post last Friday, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple got away from the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after, by insulting her, they were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists', husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was an accident?"
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
About comparing the lawsuit to extortion, Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That's not very sympathetic', added the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion is quick to captivate the couple on social media, where they are denounced for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not be very interested in a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to get in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's enormous success, it's very entertaining."
She said that her father, who, before being inspired to write the children's book about a little toy bear, worked as a cameraman at the British BBC station, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt 'bittersweet' after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she told that her father was secretly proud of the final success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But since Paddington was so lifelike to him, it almost looked like an achievement of a child; you're proud when you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he sort of experienced Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for success.'
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that they expected her not to make it', said Mrs.Ednan-Laperouse.
'Then came Nad's call to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly wore off and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this trial took everything out.
All I could do was sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I had to be really big."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the death of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Roving women stick messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who are loved by suicide are fighting to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys stick up inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first got depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in the English county of Gloucestershire, reports that her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room."
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deeply depressed."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm always worried about a chain reaction coming."
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep quiet - talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling bleak or depressed or anything," she said.
'A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was totally on the ground on Christmas Day - when the kids unpacked their presents he didn't look at them at all.'
She said his death was a major trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: "It's tearing apart the whole family.
It's driving us apart.
But we all have to keep on fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as FBI investigates
'I thought, if we could indeed get what he is asking for; an investigation limited in time and size, we might be able to create a little more unity again', says Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart, amid a firmly anchored stalemate within the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The mid-term elections are already in five weeks' time, on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their efforts to get their husbands elected to the highest court in the country will be severely hampered.
George W. Bush has already called members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus met his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has the report ready?
Then there will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently in session.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice President, to cast the decisive vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean defectors has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Enabling, states that there were 1,127 defectors last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park noted that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers were the main factors in the decline.
Pyongyang didn't respond in public.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean nationality.
According to Seoul sources, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily secured demilitarised zone (DMZ; Demilitarised Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often violently expels them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still formally in a state of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, mainly discussing the stagnant negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the US, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they broadly agreed to work towards the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Secretary of State, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
'Without faith in the actions of the US, confidence in our national security is also lacking, and under these circumstances there is no first step towards unilateral disarmament', said Mr Ri during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysteric', and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called candidate judge for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysteric', and found him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved that way, they would call her 'hysterical', Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes almost screamed and was particularly upset when he told about his family and his high school days.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'great and coordinated character murder', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
'I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and by the way he speaks about the Clintons and the democrats', says Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to institute an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he were to be appointed, and the democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
'I can say this about that; if he does not tell the truth in Congress, or the FBI, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he now serves', said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeal of the District of Columbia (usually abbreviated D.C.).
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned that Kavanaugh would vote against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (law for affordable health care) because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh circumvented questions about reviewing certain Supreme Court decisions during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to stand up and cheer when a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed to the Supreme Court', says Pelosi.
Women just have to give in to this.
It is a righteous tirade of months and years of pent-up anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We're gonna cry when we get mad," Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge somewhere and who told me that she too would cry when she got angry. She developed a method, in which she would cry every time she got angry. To the person she was talking to, she said: 'You may think that I am sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partially permitted as an expression of anger, because crying is fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my best-kept memories from a former job, in a man-dominated office, was when I cried terribly because I was very angry. An older woman, a cold business manager that everyone was a little afraid of, grabbed me in the neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'cat evil' or 'ape strokes') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs.Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she should not run herself.
'It wasn't a well-considered decision', she told me 30 years later laughing.
'There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone mentioned "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind on fundraising, so she pledged not to participate if she couldn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, only wanted to give her $250.
"Do they think I might get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger over sexism - that she choked on it.
'They must have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,' Mrs. Schroeder remembered about how the media reacted to her.
'They must have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the US-China trade war can be beneficial for Beijing
The opening balances of the US-China trade war were deafening, and although the struggle has not yet been fought, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the US president, gave the first warning earlier this year by raising taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week became known when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for 200 billion dollars (150 billion euros) of goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken reprisals each time in kind, most recently by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for 60 billion dollars of American goods.
China has pledged to match the US every time, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink quickly.
In order for Washington to bow down, requests must be granted, but public bowing to the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the US could positively support China in the longer term, by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could lead one of the two countries to an economic free fall is indeed much more dangerous than spectators have previously recognized', says Abigail Grace, a research officer of the 'Center for a New American Security', a think tank specialising in national security issues, which focuses on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war of over seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in his country were improving.
'Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism', he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that some six million people still live in the country, who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the golf course "Le Golf National" southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was wrestling almost the entire tournament, let his long battle from the tee land in the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players that once won 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest ranking player on the world ranking list, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play by Ian Poulter from Britain, who possibly played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so easily, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help', said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole to go in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel for beating Tiger Woods. I followed that guy every time I was growing up," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: 'I am proud of these boys, they have fought.
Shortly this morning, we made Europe a little more difficult.
We resisted.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players on his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking ahead.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
