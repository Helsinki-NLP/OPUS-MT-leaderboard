Former U.S. President of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich became second with 32 percent.
Florida applies the principle 'winner takes all' and assigned all fifty delegates to Romney, after which he became the leader for the Republican Party's nomination.
According to the protest organizers, there were around 100,000 people present in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
According to the police, in Berlin there were an estimated 6,500 protesters.
Protests were also held in Paris, in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, the Maltese capital Valetta, the Estonian capital Tallinn and the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow.
In London, a protest of some 200 people took place at several copyright owners' offices.
When Poland signed ACTA last month, major protests broke out, making the Polish Government decide not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed the process of joining ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) once again make themselves strong to oblige hanging CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
David O'Shannessy is Superintendent of RSPCA New South Wales and he told the ABC that supervision and control of slaughterhouses in Australia should be a normal procedure.
'The surveillance cameras make it clear to the people who work with animals that the welfare of the animals has top priority.'
On the international earthquake map used by the United States Geological Survey, no earthquakes in Iceland were seen in the previous week.
The Meteorological Institute of Iceland reported no seismic activity in the past 48 hours in Hekla.
The large amount of earthquakes that caused a phase transition took place on the northeastern side of the upper caldera of the volcano on 10 March.
Dark clouds that had nothing to do with volcanic activity were observed at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds caused confusion as to whether the volcano had really erupted.
There was 120-160 cubic feet of fuel aboard the Luno when the ship suffered engine problems and was pushed against the wavebreaker by the hard wind and waves.
The twelve crew members have been brought to safety with helicopters, with the only injury a broken nose.
The 100-metre-long ship was on its way to pick up the usual cargo of fertilizer. Initially, authorities feared that the vessel could start leaking with the cargo.
In 2011, both parts of Congress already voted in favour of the proposed amendment.
This legislative session has been amended when the second sentence was first deleted by the House of Representatives and then adopted by the Senate in a similar form on Monday.
Failure to comply with the second judgment, which states that cohabitants of the same sex are not allowed, could lead to this being allowed in the future.
HJR-3 will be reviewed by the next elected legislature in 2015 or 2016.
The director Vautier will also be remembered for his hunger strike in 1973 against, in his own words, political censorship.
The French law has changed. He was already an activist at the age of 15, when he decided to join the French resistance in World War II.
He recorded himself in a book in 1998.
In the 1960s, he went back to newly independent Algeria to teach film regie.
Winner of two Olympic gold medals, Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, has died at the age of 54.
It was reported that the cause of death was bile duct cancer.
He died Tuesday in Osaka.
Saito was not only the former Olympic and world champion at the time of death, but also the chairman of the training committee of the All Japan Judo Federation.
At least 100 people were present at the party celebrating the first wedding day of a couple who married last year.
A formal anniversary event was scheduled for a later date, according to the officials.
The couple married in Texas a year ago and celebrated it in Buffalo with friends and family.
The 30-year-old husband was born in Buffalo and one of four persons killed in the shooting, but his wife has not been injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who taught under Modern Education and King's Glory. He claimed to have 9,000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes he used words that some parents resent and he would have used blasphemy in class.
Modern Education blamed him for sticking large advertisements on buses without permission and for pretending to be the principal English teacher.
He was previously accused of copyright infringement, but he was not prosecuted for this.
A former student said he used 'street language in class, taught in dating skills in notes and was just a friend of the students'.
Over the past three decades, China has developed a market economy despite the fact that it is still officially a Communist state.
For example, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic changes were carried out.
From then on, the Chinese economy has increased 90 times in size.
Last year, China first exported more cars than Germany and even the US, making it the largest market in the industry.
China's GDP may be greater than that of the United States within two decades.
The fourth tropical storm over the Atlantic Ocean in the 2010 season, called Danielle, has formed in the east of the ocean.
The storm, which is about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum sustained wind speed of 40 mph (64 km/h).
The scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will reach hurricane power around Wednesday.
Since the storm is far from raging, it remains difficult to estimate the possible consequences for the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, born in Zagreb (the capital of Croatia), became famous when he played for the club Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and continued to play for them until 1958.
During his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 games.
No one else has ever appeared more or made more goals for the club than Bobek.
He was elected the best player in Partisan history in 1995.
The festivities were kicked off with a special show by the world-famous group Cirque du Soleil.
After that, Staat-Symphonie Orchestra of Istanbul, a Janitaren band and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses followed.
Then the Whirling Dervishes came up on stage.
The Turkish diva Sezen Aksu shared the stage with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and the Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
In conclusion, the show 'Troy' was performed by the Turkish dance group Fire of Anatolia.
After an accident at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, thirteen-year-old motorcycle driver Peter Lenz died.
During his warm-up round, Lenz fell off his bike, and was hit by fellow driver Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately treated by the attending medical staff and transported to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat was not injured in the accident.
Zapatero continued that, given the global financial situation, 'the financial system is an essential part of the economy.
We have been in a financial crisis for a year, which has reached its peak in the last two months, and I expect the financial market to begin to recover now.'
Last week, Naked News announced that it will drastically expand international coverage with three new broadcasts in different languages.
The global organization already reports in English and Japanese, but now also launches programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for TV, Internet and mobile devices.
Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a terrifying spectacle: people tried to break windows to get out.
People hit the windows with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
'One of the windows broke and they started climbing out the window,' said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
By the energy released when hydrogen atoms are merged (or fused) to form heavier elements, the stars give off light and heat.
Scientists develop a reactor that can generate energy in this way.
However, this problem is difficult to solve, and it will take many years for usable nuclear reactors to be built.
The steel needle floats on the water thanks to the surface tension.
The surface tension is created because the water molecules at the surface of the water react more strongly to each other than they react to the air molecules above.
On the water mirror surface, the water molecules make a kind of skin layer that is not visible, so that objects float on it like needles.
The irons of modern skates have a double edge with a hollow emptiness between them. The two edges provide more grip on the ice, even when making bends.
Because the bottom of the knife is slightly bent and the knife tilts to one of both sides, the edge that comes into contact with the ice will also be bent.
This will turn the skater. When the skates are tilted to the right, the skater turns to the right and when they are tilted to the left, the skater turns to the left.
They must lose the extra energy extracted from the light to return to the previous energy level.
They do this by emitting a small light particle called a 'photon'.
Scientists call this process a 'stimulated emission of radiation', because the bright light stimulates the atoms, causing the emission of a photon of light, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next picture shows atoms that emit photons. In reality, photons are of course a lot smaller than on the photo.
Photons are even smaller than the particles that atoms are made of!
After hundreds of hours of burning, the filament in the lamp will eventually burn through, after which the filament lamp no longer works.
The pear should then be replaced. Be careful when replacing the pear.
First of all, the switch of the light luminaire must be switched off or the cable pulled out of the socket.
This is because the electricity flowing into the socket where the metal part of the lamp is located can cause a severe electrical shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the lamp if it is still partly in the socket.
The main organ of the blood vessels system is the heart that pumps the blood.
Blood leaves the heart through a type of tube called arteries, and comes back to the heart through other tubes, veins, and the smallest tubes are called capillaries.
With its teeth, a Triceratops could have shattered not only leaves, but even very tough branches and roots.
Some scientists think the triceratops ate cycaden, which is a type of plant that was common to the Cretaceous Age.
These plants resemble a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, spiny leaves.
With its strong beak, a Triceratops could have retrieved the leaves of the tribe before eating the tribe.
According to other scientists, these plants are highly toxic and were not eaten by dinosaurs. Even though some animals that live today, for example sloths and parrots (the descendants of the dinosaurs) may eat leaves or fruit species that are poisonous.
What effect does the gravity of Io have on me? On the surface of Io you weigh less than on earth.
A person who weighs 90 kg on Earth would weigh about 16 kg on Io, which means that the gravity pulls less hard on you.
The sun does not have a tangible outer layer such as the earth's crust, but consists entirely of fire, gases and plasma.
As you get further from the core of the sun, the gas becomes thinner.
When you look at the sun, the outer part that you see is the photo atmosphere, or 'ball of light'.
About three thousand years later, the Italian astronomer used a telescope in 1610 and discovered that Venus, like the moon, exhibits phases.
When only the side of Venus (or the moon) is lit up to the sun, then phases arise. Copernicus' theory that the planets orbit the sun is supported by the phases of Venus.
The transit of Venus was observed several years later, in the year 1639, by Jeremiah Horrocks, an astronomer from England.
After the Danelaw had been recaptured, it was long peace in England.
Ethelred came face to face in 991 with a Viking fleet that was a lot bigger than Guthrum's a century earlier.
The fleet leader was Olaf Trygvassion, a Norwegian who wanted to regain his land on the Danes.
After a number of military setbacks, Ethelred and Olaf managed to agree. Ethelred returned to Norway to win back his kingdom with varying success.
The only deliberately designed alphabet that is still much in daily use is Hangul. It was designed in 1444 under King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth and one of the most esteemed kings of the Joseon dynasty.
He initially called it Hangeulphabet Hunmin Jeongeum. That means "the right sounds to instruct the people."
There are many theories about the origin of Sanskrit, one about the migration of Aryans from the west to India, who took their own language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is similar to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The world's oldest known book is in Sanskrit, which was competing away after the Upanishads were drafted.
Sanskrit has formed the source for a large number of modern Indian languages and is a very complex and extensive language. Latin was the source for European languages such as French and Spanish.
When the battle for France was over, Germany prepared for the invasion of the island of Britain.
Germany gave the attack the code name 'Operation Seeelöwe'. Most of the heavy weapons and supplies of the British army had been lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, which had severely weakened the army.
However, the Royal Navy was still stronger than the German Navy ('Kriegsmarine'). They had destroyed every invasion fleet that could cross the English canal.
However, there were few royal naval ships lying near logical attack routes, because the admirals were afraid they would be sunk in a German air strike.
First we will talk about the plans of Italy, the little one opposite 'big brothers' Germany and Japan.
Both his army and the fleet were weaker, despite the fact that four new ships had been manufactured just before the war.
The main targets of Italy were African countries, and to conquer these countries they needed a strategic opening for their troops, so that these troops could invade the Mediterranean Africa.
They had to get rid of the British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, the battleships of Italy were not allowed to do anything else.
Like Britain, Japan was an island state.
Submarines are ships specially designed to sail underwater for a long time.
Submarines were deployed in the First and Second World Wars. At the time they were very slow and their weapons had a limited range.
In the first phase of the war, they often moved on floatingly, but when the radar developments led to greater accuracy, the submarines had to dive to remain unseen.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans were very skilled in the control and navigation of their submarines.
Germans had great successes with submarines and therefore they are not familiar with too many submarines after the war.
King Tutankhamon is today one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt.
In ancient times, however, he was not considered important and he is not included in most lists of ancient kings.
The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. Although many ancient tombs have been robbed, his tomb remained virtually untired.
Most objects buried together with Tutanchamon are well preserved, including many artifacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
Thanks to the invention of the spoke wheel, the chariots of Assyria became lighter, faster and therefore better equipped for avoiding soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows shot with the deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of hostile soldiers. The first calvary was introduced by the Assyrians around 1000 BC.
A cavalry is an army fighting on horseback. Because the saddle had not yet been invented, the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare back of their horses.
We are familiar with many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Probably Homer is the best-known Greek person: the legendary blind poet who wrote two Greek literary poems: the poems Ilias and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights and their pieces are counted among the top of world literature.
Another well-known Greek mathematician is Pythagoras. He has become known by his famous theorem about the relationship between the different sides of rectangular triangles.
Estimates of Hindi's number of speakers range from the second to the third most widely spoken language worldwide.
It depends on whether or not the very closely related dialects are counted, how many native speakers there are.
It is estimated that there are 340 million to 500 million speakers, and about 800 million people can understand the language.
As for vocabulary, Hindi and Urdu are similar, but the writing differs; speakers of both languages can usually understand each other in everyday conversations.
Around the fifteenth century, northern Estonia was strongly culturally influenced by Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring the original population into contact with God and therefore developed the Estonian letter language.
It was based on the German alphabet and one sign 'Õ/õ' was added.
Over time, many German borrowing words were merged, which was the beginning of the enlightenment.
According to tradition, the throne heir would go directly into the army after completing school.
However, Charles attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a 2:2 (a lower, second-rate degree) by studying anthropology, archaeology and later history.
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive a diploma.
The European part of Turkey (East Thrace or Romania in the Balkans) covers 3% of the land area.
The Turkish territory covers more than 1,600 km (1,000 miles) in length and 800 km (500 miles) in width and has a bit the shape of a rectangle.
Turkey's surface area, including lakes, is about 783,562 km2 (300,948 mi2), of which about 755.688 km2 (291,773 mi2) is in south-west Asia and about 23,764 km2 (9174 mi2) is in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world and is about the size of Metropolitan France and the United Kingdom together.
Turkey borders three sides on a sea: the Aegean Sea on the west side, the Black Sea on the north side and the Mediterranean Sea on the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it has only been independent since 1839.
Parts of present-day Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg and came into Belgian hands after the Belgian Revolution in the 1930s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, but was occupied by Germany in both the First and Second World Wars.
Luxembourg was a co-founder of the organisation we know today as the European Union in 1957.
The Drukgyal Dzong is a defunct fort and Buddhist monastery at the top of the district of Paro (in the village of Phondey).
According to tradition, the fort was made in the year 1649 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel in memory of his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol troops.
After a fire in 1951, there are only a few relics of Kukgyal Dzong left, including the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
The fort was preserved and protected after the fire. It also remained one of Bhutan's most spectacular sights.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was surrounded by two powerful neighbours: Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century Cambodia was invaded several times by the Thai. In 1772 Phnom Phen was destroyed.
In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of the Venezuelan population are unemployed, and most of the people who do have jobs are employed in the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelans work in the service sector, one quarter of which work in the industrial sector and one fifth in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for the Venezuelans, as the country is net exporter; yet only one percent of the population works in the oil industry.
In the early years of the country's independence, experts from Singapore's botanical gardens helped turn the island into a tropical city garden.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a cross between orchids, was chosen as a national flower.
Around October almost 1.5 million herbivores migrate each year from the northern hills to the southern flat areas because it rains there. They cross the Mara River.
And after the April rainfall again northwards via the west, again through the Mara River.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti national park, the Ngorongoro nature reserve, the Maswa wildlife reserve in Tanzania and the Masai Mara national nature reserve in Kenya.
To create interactive media, you need to master conventional and traditional techniques and handle tools in interactive training (storyboards, audio and video editing, story techniques, etc.)
Interactive design requires that you reconsider your assumptions about media production and that you learn to think non-linearly.
In an interactive design, parts of the project are connected, but they are also self-understanding.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that you need much more focal complexity and lens components than prime lenses to reach a number of focal distances.
Now that lens manufacturers use an ever higher standard in the manufacture of lenses, this becomes less and less a problem.
As a result, zoom lenses yielded a similar photo quality to lenses with a fixed focal length.
Zoom objects also have the disadvantage that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes low-cost zoom objects difficult to use if there is little light and no flash is used.
One of the most common problems when you try to convert a movie to a DVD format is the overscan.
TVs are usually made to please the general public.
That's why you see on TV that often the edges on the top and bottom and on the sides are cut off.
This is made so that the image covers the entire screen. It's called overscan.
Unfortunately, if you create a DVD, the edges will also be cut off. If the subtitle of the video is placed too close to the bottom edge, it will not be displayed in its entirety.
The traditional medieval castle has long appealed to the imagination and evokes images of knights' games, banquets and knighthood such as Arthur's.
Even if you stand between the thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of long-flooded battles. You can almost hear the hoofing on the street stones and smell how the fear increases in the dungeons.
The question is whether our imagination is based on reality. Why did we start building castles at some point? How were they designed and built?
The Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified mansion than a real castle, which is characteristic of this time.
With its large windows and thin walls, it would not have been able to withstand a serious attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began construction, it was relatively peaceful in the country and only small groups of wandering poachers posed a danger.
The power relationship was a system whereby European countries wanted to preserve the national sovereignty of all European states.
The concept meant that all European countries had to prevent one country becoming too powerful. National governments had to establish new alliances regularly in order to maintain the balance.
The Spanish Succession War was the first war in which power relations were central.
This was an important change, since the European powers would no longer have a pretext for carrying out religious wars, which could make the Thirty Years' War the last religious war.
The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was set on fire by Herostratus on 21 July 356 BC and destroyed.
According to the story, he was driven by fame at all costs. The Ephesians were indignant and said the name of Herostratus would never be recorded.
The name was later mentioned by the Greek historian Strabo, so we still know it today. The temple was destroyed in the birth night of Alexander the Great.
During his reign Alexander was willing to pay for a rebuilding, but this was rejected. After his death the temple was still rebuilt in 323 BC.
Try to hit all notes with as little tension as possible in and unnecessary movements with your hand.
Don't get so tired. Don't forget that you don't have to hit the keys with a lot of force for extra volume like on the piano.
To make more sound with the accordion you have to compress the bellows harder or faster.
Mysticism is believing in, identifying with or consciousness of an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth or God.
The churchgoer strives for a direct awareness, intuition or insight into divine reality.
Followers pursue a certain way of life or want to gain experiences that give them the same feeling.
Unlike other religious beliefs and worship, mysticism emphasizes the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially of a peaceful, insightful, blissful or ecstatic nature.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the 15th century from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition in the Punjab region.
The faith is seen by Sikhs as a separate religion, although the origin and tradition of Hinduism is acknowledged.
The religion of the sikhs they call themselves 'gurmat', Punjabi for 'the path of the guru'. Gurus play a fundamental role in all religions in India, but in particular form the core of the beliefs of sikhism.
Guru Nanak (1469-1539) founded religion in the 15th century. Then followed a further nine gurus.
But Khrushchev's promises were put to the test in June 1956, when riots changed in Poland, demonstrating by workers against food shortages and wage cuts, namely, a complete protest against communism.
Eventually, Krushchev sent tanks to restore order. He conceded to a number of economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new Prime Minister.
The Indus civilization from the Bronze Age was in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent and included most of modern-day Pakistan, some regions in northwest India and northeast Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the basins of the Indus and also owes its name to this river.
Although some scientists suspect that 'Indus civilization' is the appropriate name for the civilization that lived in the basin of the dried Sarasvati River, others call it the Harappan civilization after Harappa, the first excavation site from the 1920s.
Thanks to the militarist nature of the Roman Empire, development in medical progress could be made.
Emperor Augustus recruited doctors who also formed the first Roman medical corps, intended to be deployed after wars.
Surgeons had several sedatives, including morphine from extracts of poppy seed and scopolamine from bibwort.
They became amputation experts with the aim of saving patients from gangrene and were also skilled in applying tourniquets and artery clamps to stop bleeding.
The Roman Empire has been very successful in the field of medicine for many centuries and is responsible for much of the knowledge we have today.
Pureland origami is origami where only one fold is allowed at a time. More complex ways of folding, such as folding, may not, and only be folded straight ahead.
John Smith designed this in the 1970s, in support of inexperienced foldings or foldings with limited motor skills.
Children develop a sense of race and racial stereotypes at an early age and these can influence their behaviour.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority who are not doing well in school according to the stereotype tend to confirm this assumption once they know that the stereotype is associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and currently contains 54 million profiles.
These websites have attracted a lot of attention, particularly from education.
These websites have positive aspects, such as easily setting up a class page that can contain blogs, videos, photos and other features.
Access to this page is easy by specifying only one web address, making it easy to remember and easy to type in by students who have difficulty spelling or using a keyboard.
It can be adjusted to easily read it with as much or little color as one wishes.
Attention Deficiency Disorder (ADD) 'is a neurological syndrome that emerges in a combination of three classic characteristic symptoms, such as impulsiveness, distraction and hyperactivity or too much energy.
It is a learning disability and not a learning disability, affecting 3 to 5 percent of all children and up to 2 million children from America'.
Children with ADD have difficulty concentrating on things like schoolwork. However, they can focus on things they like, such as games, their favorite drawing series or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children often work in the nests because they 'show risky behavior, argue and challenge authorities'. They do this to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated with normal methods.
ADD affects relationships with peers. Other children often do not understand why the ADD'er reacts in a certain way or spells words differently. There can also be too big a difference in adulthood.
The basic pace with which knowledge was accumulated changed, as the ability to acquire and learn in the way described above changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. There was no more pressure within the individual recall, but the focus was more on the ability to recall text.
In essence, the Renaissance caused a major change in the way of learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands for moving, carrying or waving through the trees.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee have a similar size and length and reflect the use of the hand for carrying the weight when walking on the knuckles.
The hand of gay sapiens is shorter than the foot, and has right legs.
Petrified handbones of about two to three million years old show this shift from moving forward to manipulation in the specialization of the hand.
There are also people who think that if you often experience artificially cheerful lucid dreams, this can be very tiring.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that lucide dreams prolong the time between the different REM sleep states.
If you don't get enough brake sleep every night, your body won't recover fast enough, so that at some point it becomes a problem.
This is as exhausting as if you woke up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch television.
The effect depends on the number of times your brain tries to dream brightly every night.
The Italians in North Africa were not well from the beginning. After Italy declared war on 10 June 1940, Fort Capuzzo in Libya was seized by the British 11th Huzaren within a week.
During an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Lastucci, the army's Italian tenth engineer.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, Libya's Libyan Governor-General and intended successor to Mussolini, died in Tobroek by friendly fire when they landed there.
Modern fencing is played at all levels, from students learning it at the university to Olympic level.
The sport is primarily played in duels, with two fencers dueling with each other.
Golf is a game where players have to hit balls with a club in a hole.
In a regular round, eighteen holes are played. Players basically start on the first hole of the track and finish at the eighteenth.
The player who needs the least turn or pass with the club to complete the course is the winner.
It is played on grass, which is mowed around the hole shorter (the green).
The most common form of tourism is perhaps what almost everyone associates with travel: recreational tourism.
This happens when people go to a place that is different from their daily environment and relax and enjoy there.
Tourists often search for beaches, amusement parks and camping sites for recreation.
If someone visits a specific place with the aim of learning something about the history and culture of that place, we call this cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different sights of a particular country or they can explore a specific area.
On this the settlers had also called for auxiliary forces.
The first and third regiment of New Hampshire, consisting of 200 men led by Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both were later promoted to generals), was part of the troops that were to strengthen the forward position.
Stark's men took positions along the fence all the way north of where the colonist was.
When space was created along the Mystic River and the northeast part of the peninsula during ebb, they quickly extended the fence with a short, stone wall towards the north to the waterfront on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a pole at about 100 feet (30 metres) in front of the fence and ordered everyone to wait for the regular troops to pass.
The American plan involved carrying out coordinated attacks from three different directions.
According to this plan, General John Cadwalder would as a distraction attack the British garrison at Bordentown to stop reinforcements.
General James Ewing crossed the river at Trenton Ferry with 700 of his militia members, captured the bridge that ran over the Assunpink River, and prevented hostile troops from escaping.
The largest attack cry of 2400 men crossed the river, some 9 miles above Trenton, and split into two groups, a group led by Greene, and one led by Sullivan, to attack before sunrise.
Now that the run is not a quarter mile, but a half mile, it's less about speed and much more about endurance.
Of course, a first-class half-miler, or a person with a time of less than two minutes, must have a decent speed, although endurance must be protected at all times.
It is best prepared for the running season with some field running in winter combined with breast training in the gym.
A good diet alone is not enough to perform at top level, but is very important for the general well-being of young athletes.
By maintaining a healthy energy balance, putting into practice effective hydration habits and understanding the different aspects of supplements, athletes can improve their performance and enjoy the sport more.
Running at a medium distance is less expensive compared to other sports. However, there are many misunderstandings about the few required pieces of equipment for participation.
Products can be purchased if necessary, but most products have little to no real impact on performance.
Athletics may feel like they prefer a product, even if that product does not have any real benefits.
The atom is seen as a fundamental building block for all matter.
It is a complex whole that, according to the simplified Bohr model, consists of a central core surrounded by electrons, similar to planets orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The core consists of two parts: neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge, and neutrons have no charge, and the electrons have a negative electrical charge.
In order to investigate the victim, you must first check the environment in order to guarantee your own safety.
You need to watch the victim's position and any alarm signals when you approach him or her.
If you get hurt trying to help, you might just make it worse.
This study showed that the relationship between lower back pain and disability is based on depression, anxiety and fear of catastrophes.
The regular weekly structured PA sessions only affected catastrophic thinking and not depression and anxiety.
Participants in the regular activity needed more support in the field of negative pain perception, making clear the difference between chronic pain and discomfort and the normal physical movement.
Visibility, or the ability to see, depends on senses of the visual system or eyes.
There is a large number of different constructions of the eyes, which differ in the complexity depending on the needs of the organism.
The different constructions have different possibilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different sharpness levels. In addition, they require different processing to be able to be wise from the input and different figures to work optimally.
The concept of population indicates a group of organisms belonging to the same specific species located within a specific geographical region.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, which means that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments with it.If all individuals in a population have the same phenotypic properties, they are known as monomorphic.
On the other hand, if they show different variants of a particular characteristic, it is called polymorphism.
Colonies of predatory ants march and also reproduce in different phases.
Roof ants move on in the nomadic phase at night and they stop during the day to rest.
When the available food sources decrease, the colony lives for a certain time as a nomadic species. During this period they make a temporary nest each day in another place.
All these nomadic storm runs or marches last for about 17 days.
What is a cell? The Latin word 'cella' is the origin of the word, meaning 'small space'. The word was first coined by a microscopicist who studied the structure of cork.
Each living being is made up of one or more cells: they form the basis of life.
When you study life, cells are so fundamental and crucial that they are often called 'the building blocks of life'.
By sending nerve stimuli through the body, the nervous system maintains the homeostasis and allows the blood flow to pass undisturbed.
The nerve impulses pass very quickly through the body, which promotes the safety of the body in the event of potential danger.
Compared to other heavy storms, the affected area in tornadoes is relatively small. However, everything that comes on their path is destroyed.
The damage of tornadoes includes uprooted trees, destroyed walls and high-throwed cars. They can take very long, up to three hours for the two percent most violent tornadoes.
Such monster storms can have winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Man has been making and using lenses for thousands of years to expand things.
However, the first real telescopes were made in Europe by the end of the 16th century.
By combining two lenses, objects in these telescopes appear to be both closer and larger.
Man will always be greedy and selfish, and in cooperation it is always the case that if the majority benefits from something, it will have more advantage in the short term to act selfishly.
It is to be hoped that most people realize that in the long term it is best to work with others.
Many people dream of the day that we can travel to another star and discover other worlds. Some people wonder what can be found in space and some believe that there are aliens or other forms of life on another planet.
But if this is ever going to happen, it will only be over a long time, and the stars are so far apart that there are trillions of miles between stars that are considered 'neighbours'.
Maybe one day your great-grandchildren are standing on top of an alien world and wondering what happened to their ancestors?
Animals are made up of many cells, they eat things and digest this food in their stomachs, and most animals can move sight.
Only animals have brains (although they don't all have brains; for example, jellyfish don't have brains).
They dig in the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the air.
A cell is the smallest part of a living being or organism with its structural and functional properties.
The word 'cell' is derived from the word 'cella' from Latin, which is a small room.
When you look at living things with a microscope, you see that they consist of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, discovered small squares in cork with a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and compositions can be brought from one state to another without changing.
As a gas, nitrogen has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state has a higher density, but the molecules are still the same.
Another example is water, the composition of which is two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom.
Regardless of whether it is a gas, liquid or solid, the molecular structure is the same.
The chemical state remains the same, even if the physical state can change.
Time is all around us, affecting everything we do, yet remains something elusive.
Religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars have been studying time for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that go from the future through the present to the past.
Time also compares the duration (length) of events.
If you observe the occurrence of a cyclic event again, you can mark the passage of time yourself. A cyclic event is an event that occurs regularly over and over again.
Today computers are used to edit photos and videos.
Complex animations can be made on the computer, and this type of animation is increasingly used on television and in films.
Advanced computers are often used to record music with the aim of processing and mixing sounds.
For much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the earliest inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, who hunted huge birds called moas.
The theory led to the idea that the Maori people were in a large fleet from Polynesia and conquered New Zealand on the Moriori, after which an agricultural society was formed.
However, there are new indications that the Moriori were a group of Maoris on the mainland who moved from New Zealand to the islands of Chatham and built there a personal, peaceful community.
Another tribe in the Catham Islands were Maori who emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriori and after a few skirmishes and the Moriori were eventually swept away
People with decades of experience helped us to assess our strengths and our passions, as they frankly assessed the difficulties and even the mistakes.
Listening to individuals who shared their story about themselves, their family or the organization, brought us valuable insights about the past and about those who have influenced the corporate culture in any way.
Although understanding one's past is not the same as understanding culture, it helps people get at least a sense of where they are in the history of the organization.
While evaluating success and becoming aware of mistakes, one finds out together with all the participants what the values, the mission and the driving force of the organization are.
In these circumstances, it was very useful to look at earlier examples of entrepreneurial behaviour and the successes that came from it, which made people responsive to new changes and a new direction for the local church.
Thanks to such success stories, the fear of change has been reduced and at the same time one becomes more positive about changes in the future.
With thought patterns that converge, you can come to a solution by combining different concepts or areas.
The focus of this mindset is on speed, logical thinking and accuracy, as well as the determination of facts, the re-application of existing techniques and the collection of information.
In this way of thinking, there is only one right answer. There are only two options: right or wrong.
This thinking fits in with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking can think logically, be able to remember patterns, solve problems and work on scientific research.
Humanity as a species is by far the best at reading one's intentions.
That means that we can well predict what other people perceive, mean, believe, know or desire.
It is important to understand the intention of others, which allows us to remove possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you see someone smashing into the window of a car, you probably assume that this person is trying to steal a stranger’s car.
If he tried to break into his own car because he had lost his keys, he must be judged in a different way.
The physical phenomenon behind MRI is called nuclear spin resonance (nuclear magnetic resonance of NMR) and was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).
Thanks to the magnetic field and the radio waves, atoms in this resonance give off tiny radio signals.
Raymond Damadian is a doctor and research scientist who made a discovery in 1970: he encountered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was granted, the first MRI patent in the world.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian built the first MRI scanner for the 'whole body'. He called the scanner the 'indestructible'.
Asynchronous communication gives time for reflection and to respond to others.
This allows students to decide how quickly they work and get instructions.
Moreover, there are fewer time constraints now that flexible working hours are possible (Bremer, 1998).
The use of the Internet and the global web offers students the opportunity to always have access to information.
Instead of waiting for the next face-to-face appointment, students can ask their supervisors questions at any time of the day and get a fairly quick answer.
The postmodernist learning approach offers absolute freedom. There is no right way to learn.
In fact, there is not one good way to learn. Learning takes place in the experience between the one who learns and the one who transfers the knowledge.
This point is reflected in all educational and do-it-yourself programs.
Many of us watch television shows about situations or experiences that we are never going to experience, and that we are never going to do anything with.
We will never fix a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to see old ruins or renovate our neighbors' home.
Greenland has good connections to Europe and broadband satellite thanks to its subsea fibre optic cable connections, and 93% of the population have Internet access.
Your hotel or host family (when staying in a private house or guest house) probably has Wi-Fi or a PC with internet access and in all places you can find an internet café or a location with public Wi-Fi.
As mentioned earlier, the word 'Eskimo' is considered derogatory by many non-American Arctic populations, especially in Canada. However, the use is still accepted in the US.
You may have heard of the term Greenlandic Natives, but this word should be avoided by foreigners.
In Greenland, indigenous residents call themselves Inuit when they are in Canada, and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), meaning a Greenlander, when they are in Greenland.
Crime, and generally maliciousness to outsiders, is hardly found in Greenland. Even in villages there is no 'dangerous area'.
Kou is probably the only real danger to someone who is unprepared.
When you visit Greenland in the cold season (assuming it will get colder as you go north) it is very important to bring enough warm clothing.
The long days in summer can make it difficult to get enough sleep and may lead to related health problems.
During the summer months also watch out for the Norwegian mosquitoes. Although they do not transmit diseases, they can be annoying.
Although the economy of San Francisco is linked to its status as a world-class tourist attraction, the economy is diverse.
The largest employment is created by professional services, the government, the financial sector, trade and tourism.
The frequent interpretation in films, music, literature and popular culture has led to the city and its monuments being famous all over the world.
San Francisco has a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and top facilities for congresses.
For Oriental cuisine (Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese) it is best to go to San Francisco.
A trip to Walt Disney World is a major milestone for many American families.
A 'typical' visit includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus ride to a Disney hotel on site, a stay of a week without leaving Disney's grounds, and the return home.
Although there are infinitely many variants, most people really mean this when they say they're going to Disneyland.
Many online sold tickets on auction sites like eBay or Craigslist are partly used multi-day Park Hopper tickets.
Despite the fact that this is common, Disney prohibits it: tickets are not transferable.
You need a permit to camp under the edge of the Grand Canyon.
The permits are limited to protect the mountain gorge and are made available on the 1st day of the month, four months in advance.
A backcountry permit with an initial date in May is therefore available on 1 January.
In the most popular places the available places can run out quickly, for example the Bright Angel Campground near Phantom Ranch, which is generally already filled on the first available booking day.
A limited number of authorisations are available for first-come-in applications.
If you want to see all the beauty of southern Africa, it is best to get there by car. You also come to places where the regular tourist routes do not come.
This can be done in an ordinary car if you plan it well, but a 4x4 is recommended; many locations are only accessible with a 4x4 with high wheelbase.
In planning, take into account that, although the situation in southern Africa is stable, this does not apply to all neighbouring countries.
The costs and requirements for a visa vary by country and are determined by the country of origin.
Each country has unique rules as to which emergency items should be present in a car.
Victoria Falls is a city in western Zimbabwe, just across the border at Livingstone, Zambia and near Botswana.
The place is right next to the waterfalls. These are the biggest tourist attraction, but this popular tourist destination has plenty of opportunities for both adventurers and standard tourists to stay longer.
The amount of water is larger in the rainy season (November to March) and the waterfalls are much more spectacular.
If you venture on the bridge or the winding paths along the waterfalls, you will certainly not come back dry.
In addition, the huge volume of water makes it easier to see the waterfalls.
Tombe of Tutanchamon (KV62). It could well be that KV62 is the most famous tomb in the valley. Furthermore, this is the place where Howard Carters discovered the young king’s almost intact royal tomb in 1922.
The tomb of Tutanchamon is, compared to the other royal tombs, hardly worth a visit because it is smaller and has only minimal decorations.
You can only see the mummy's head and shoulders, so you can't see any of the damage done when trying to get him out of the coffin.
The magnificent treasures have been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and are no longer in the tomb.
Visitors who are short in time should go somewhere else.
Phnom Krom, 12 km away in south-western direction of Siem Reap. This temple was built under King Yasovarman on a hill at the end of the 9th century.
Climbing the hill is worth the effort because of the mood of the temple and the view over the Tonlé Sapmeer.
A visit to this place can be well combined with a cruise on the lake.
For access to the temple you need an Angkor Pass, so don't forget to bring your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.
Although many other countries and the United Nations do not recognize the city as the capital of Israel, Jerusalem is both the capital and the largest city of Israel.
The ancient city in the Judea Mountains has a fascinating history that is thousands of years old.
For Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the holy city is a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
The religiously important Jerusalem is one of Israel's most popular tourist destinations because of its many sights in the ancient core.
In Jerusalem you will find a wide variety of historical, archaeological and cultural sites. In addition, you will find lively and busy shopping centres, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to be able to show an invitation before entering Ecuador through international airports or border posts.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador must legalise the letter and it must comply with certain requirements.
In order to allow for an organised flow of migration between the two countries, these requirements have been drawn up.
Cuban citizens who have a Green Card in the US must go to an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid at least 6 months after the date of travel. A return ticket is required to show the duration of your stay.
The tour prices are lower for groups with more people, so if you are with one or two, you can try to form a group of four to six for a lower price per person.
However, you don't have to worry about that, because tourists are often pushed back and forth to fill cars.
Rather, it seems to be a way of making people think that a larger payment has to be made.
High above the northernmost tip of Machu Picchu, this steep mountain towers. Often, this mountain is used as a backdrop for the many pictures of the ruins.
It looks quite exciting from below, because it is a steep and difficult climb, but in principle it must be possible for fit people in 45 minutes.
Along most of the path, stone stairs can be found and for the steeper sections, steel cables have been placed as railings.
Nevertheless, it is very tiring and you should pay close attention to the steeper pieces, as they can be dangerous especially when wet.
Near the top is a small cave that you have to go through. It is quite low and narrow.
You can see the Galapagos Islands and the wild animals that live there best by boat, just like Charles Darwin did in 1835.
In the waters around the Galapagos Islands, more than 60 cruise ships provide space for 8 to 100 passengers.
The boats are usually full in high season and therefore most people book their place well in advance.
Make sure you book with a Galapagos expert with a lot of knowledge of the wide variety of ships.
This ensures that your specific interests and/or limitations are matched with the ship that best suits them.
Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas, while the middle and south of Chile was inhabited by the indigenous Araucans (Mapuche).
The Mapuche was one of the last independent groups of Native Americans. They were not incorporated into Spanish-speaking rule until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the middle of the Napoleonic wars which prevented Spain from having a functioning central government for a few years), the decisive victory over the Spaniards was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominica) is a Caribbean country. It consists of the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola. Haiti forms the other part of the island
The country houses not only white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, but also the oldest European city in America, which has now merged into Santo Domingo.
First, the island was inhabited by the Taínos and the Caribbean. The Caribbean were an Arawakan-speaking people who had settled here around 10,000 BC.
After the explorers arrived from Europe, the people of Tainos had already been heavily thinned by the Spanish conquerors after several years.
The conquerors from Spain finished out from 1492 to 1498 around 100,000 Taínos, according to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias)
Jardín de la Unión. This space used to be the atrium of a 17th-century monastery, the Templo de San Diego is the only building that still exists.
It is now used as a central square and there is day and night of everything to do.
There are several restaurants near the garden.In the afternoon and in the evening there are free concerts in the central gazebo.
Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss). Two balconies 69 centimeters apart are the starting point of an old love legend.
Give them some money and some kids tell you the story.
Bowen Island is a popular destination for a day trip or a weekend trip. Here you can visit kayaking, long walks, shopping and restaurants.
This authentic community can be found in Howe Sound, just outside Vancouver. It is easy to reach with regular departure water taxis from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
If you like outdoor activities, do not miss a trip on the Sea to Sky Corridor.
Whistler (1.5 hours by car from Vancouver) is pricey, but is known for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter this is one of the best North American ski locations and in summer you can enjoy authentic mountain biking.
You must have reserved a permit in advance. You must be in possession of a permit to stay overnight at Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station where you can not only camp, but wherever you can have a hot meal and stay in a dormitory. In La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos you can only camp, but no meals are served.
You can buy parking permits directly from the Ranger Station in Puerto Jiménez, although they do not accept credit cards here.
No park licences are issued by the Park Service (MINEE) if the scheduled arrival takes more than a month.
At CafeNet El Sol you can book a day ticket for a fee of $30 or $10; the details are on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands is a land of islands in free association with New Zealand. The islands are located in Polynesia, in the middle of the southern Pacific Ocean.
The archipelago consists of 15 islands spreading over an ocean surface of 2.2 million km2.
The islands are sometimes called 'Hawaii down under', because of the equal time zone with Hawaii.
It may be smaller, but it reminds some older visitors of Hawaii before it became a state, without all the major tourist hotels and other developments.
There are no cities in the Cook Islands, but they are made up of 15 different islands. The most famous islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Luxurious bed and breakfasts offered in rich countries have become a form of art today.
In the top segment B&B's of course compete mainly on two main points: the bed and breakfast.
In the most beautiful establishments one often finds the most luxurious bedding, or perhaps a handmade bedspread or an antique bed.
At breakfast you can get seasonal delicacies, or the specialty of the house.
It may be located in an antique-furnished historic building with a well-kept garden and swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and taking a long tour has an intrinsic appeal because it's so simple.
You are probably already used to driving in your own car and you know its limitations, unlike larger vehicles.
Setting up a tent on private grounds or in a place of random size may result in unwanted attention.
In short: your car is ideal to make a road trip, but is rarely useful to 'camp' in.
Camping in your car is possible if you have a large van, SUV, sedan or station wagon where the seats can be folded down.
There are hotels whose history dates back to the 19th and early 20th centuries (i.e. the golden age of steam trains and ocean steamers), even before the WWII.
In these hotels the rich and the celebrities stayed and they often offered a refined dining and nightlife life.
Also characteristic are the old fashioned clothes, the lack of modern facilities and a kind of elegant old age.
They are usually owned by a private individual, but sometimes visiting heads of state and other dignitaries are accommodated.
A traveler with enough money can consider a flight to the world which is divided into stays in numerous of these hotels.
Travellers are contacted by the hospitality exchange network with local residents in the cities they are going to.
Usually you just have to fill in an online form to join such a network; even if some networks offer or require additional verification.
A paper or online list of available host families is then provided, sometimes along with references and reviews of other travellers.
In January 2004, computer programmer Casey Fenton booked a cheap flight to Iceland, but had no place to stay: couchsurfing was a fact.
He sent students to local university e-mails and received huge amounts of offers for free accommodation.
The typical guest for a hostel is relatively young, in its twenties, but there are also older visitors.
Families with children do not see much, but some hostels do offer private rooms for families.
The city of Beijing in China will be the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will be the first city to host both summer and winter games.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the events on the covered ice rink.
Other ski events take place in the Taizieng ski area in Zhangjiakou which is located about 220 km (140 miles) away from Beijing.
Most of the temples have an annual festival from the end of November to mid-May, but that varies from temple to annual calendar.
Most temple festivals are part of the anniversary of a temple or that of the deity of the temple or of other great events related to the temple.
The temple festivals of Kerala are very interesting to attend and regular parades of decorated elephants, temple orchestra and other festivities are organized.
A world exhibition (usually called World Exposition or simply Expo) is a major international art and science festival.
Participating countries draw up artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to show the world's problems or the culture and history of their country.
International horticultural exhibitions are events for connoisseurs with flora exhibitions, botanical gardens other plant-related matters.
In theory, these can take place annually (if in other countries), but in reality this is not the case.
These events usually last between three and six months and take place in places of at least 50 hectares.
Over the years, many different film formats were used. The standard 35 mm film (negative of 36 by 24 mm) is much more common.
Normally, it can be easily refilled when it is up and provides a resolution that more or less corresponds to a current DSLR.
For some medium-sized cameras 6 by 6 cm is used or, more precisely, a negative of 56 by 56 mm.
This provides a resolution nearly four times as large as the resolution of a negative of 35 mm (3136 mm2 versus 864).
One of the most challenging topics for a photographer is wildlife and this requires a combination of patience, happiness, experience and good equipment.
Nature photography may be taken for granted, but this is similar to photography in general: a photo says more than a thousand words.
Wild photography often requires a long telephoto lens, although, for example, a group of birds or a small animal requires another lens.
It can often be difficult to see exotic animals and in parks are sometimes rules for commercial photography.
Wild animals are either reluctant or hostile, and the environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
There are over 5,000 languages worldwide, of which more than 20 have at least 50 million speakers.
Paperwords are also often easier to understand than spoken words. This applies especially to addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce properly.
In many countries the whole population speaks fluent English, and in even more countries you can expect a limited knowledge of English, especially among the younger generations.
Imagine a person from Manchester, Boston, Jamaica and Sydney having dinner together at a restaurant in Toronto.
They tell each other stories about their birthplace, told in their distinctive accents and local jargon.
Buying food in the supermarket is probably the cheapest way to get food. However, without the possibility of cooking the possibilities are limited to ready-made meals.
More and more supermarkets are expanding their supply of ready-to-eat food. Some even have a microwave or other device to warm the food on the spot.
In some countries or certain shops you will find at least one restaurant. Often it has an informal atmosphere and you can eat cheaply there.
Make a copy of your policy and the contact details of your insurer and keep them with you.
This should include the insurer's e-mail addresses and international telephone numbers for advice/authorisation and the submission of claims.
Make sure you have another copy in your luggage and online (mail yourself with attachment, or save it in the cloud).
If you travel with a laptop or tablet, it is useful to save a copy of the memory or disk (where it is accessible without the internet).
Provide travel agencies, as well as friends and family at home who want to help, with a copy of your insurance details.
Elklands are not normally aggressive, but can defend themselves if they feel threatened.
If you don't think you're in danger with a moose, you can get too close and it could just go wrong.
Drink alcohol with moderation. Alcohol affects everyone in a different way and it is important to know your own boundaries.
Over-drinking can lead to long-term health problems such as liver damage and even blindness or death. Eating illegally produced alcohol carries an even higher risk.
Illegal strong drinks can contain several dangerous impurities, such as methanol, which can cause blindness or death, even in small amounts.
Glasses may be cheaper abroad, especially in countries with low incomes and lower labour costs.
Imagine having an eye test done at home, which is also reimbursed by the insurance, and then submitting it elsewhere.
There are two problems with expensive brand mounts available in such places: some are fake mounts and the real ones are more expensive than they are at home.
Worldwide, coffee is one of the resources that are most traded. In your own region you will probably find many different types.
Nevertheless, there are many different ways of drinking coffee worldwide that are worth trying.
Canyoning (or: caynoneering) means going to the bottom of a gap that is dry or full of water.
In canyoning, elements of swimming, climbing and jumping are combined. It takes relatively little training or physical condition to start (compared to mountain climbing, diving or alpine skiing).
Walking is an outdoor activity where you walk in a natural environment, usually on hiking trails.
A day walk can consist of a walk of less than one mile to longer walks that can be walked in one day.
For a day walking along an easy route, few preparations are needed and anyone with an average condition can enjoy it.
Families with small children may need to prepare more, but a day outdoors is perfectly possible, even with babies and toddlers.
There are almost 200 organisations for running events worldwide, most of them independent.
Go Running, the successor to the Global Running Tours, consists of a network of dozens of providers of 'sightrunning' across four continents.
It began in the Running Tours Barcelona and Running Copenhagen (Copenhagen), followed by among others Running Tours Prague (Prague).
There are many things you need to think about before and when you travel anywhere.
Don't expect things to be 'just like home' when you're travelling. Ways, rules, food, traffic, your stay, use and language - it will all be to a certain extent different from what you're used to.
This must always be kept in mind, in order to avoid disappointments or even dislike local ways of doing things.
Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century. You can ask a travel agency for help when you're going to make a type of trip that you don't have any experience of when it comes to nature, culture, language or when you're going to low-income countries.
Most agencies take the most common bookings, but many agents specialize in certain types of travel, budgets or destinations.
It may be better to use a travel organiser that books more often trips similar to yours.
See what trips the cop promotes, on a website or in the window.
If you want to travel around the world without spending a lot of money, out of necessity or because of your lifestyle or a challenge, there are some ways to do this.
They basically fall into two categories: working while travelling or trying to reduce your expenses. In this article, attention is paid to the latter.
If you are willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to keep spending as low as possible, you will look at travel with a minimum budget.
It is taken for granted that tourists do not commit violations such as stealing, entering illegally, participating in the black market, begging or otherwise exploiting people.
An immigration point is usually the first stop when you leave a plane, boat or other vehicle.
On some international train journeys, train inspections are carried out on the way and you must therefore have a valid ID with you.
On some night train trips, the conductor collects the passports so you can stay the night.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa procedure. In some countries you must report your presence and your residence address to the local authorities.
You may need to fill out a form with the local police or go to an immigration office.
In many countries with such legislation, local hotels regulate the registration (ask for this).
In all other cases, only persons who reside outside tourist accommodation have to register, but this makes the legislation a lot more vague, so ask in advance.
Architecture revolves around the design and construction of buildings. Tourists often come to architecture alone.
Many buildings are quite beautiful to see and the view from a high building or a well placed window can be beautiful.
In many ways, architecture has overlaps with other areas, such as planning, civil engineering, decorative art, interior design and landscape design.
Many of the pueblos are extremely remote, so you won't find much nightlife if you don't travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, drinks are served in almost all the casinos mentioned above. Some casinos even offer brand entertainment (especially the large casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Please note: for visitors from another state it is not always wise to visit the bars in the villages.
In northern New Mexico, for example, there are major problems with driving under the influence. The concentration of drunk drivers is highest near bars in villages.
Unwanted murals or scribble is also called graffiti.
Although it is certainly not a modern phenomenon, it is usually associated with young people blazing public and private property with spray paint.
Now there are also established graffiti artists, graffiti events and 'legal' walls. As a result graffiti paintings are often more similar to works of art than to unreadable scrabble.
Many tourists would like to learn the popular boomerang throwing.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang so that it comes back, you have to make sure you have a suitable recurring boomerang.
Most of Australia’s available boomerangs, don’t even come back. It’s best for beginners not to try to throw in windy
A Hangi meal is prepared in a hot pit in the ground.
The pit is heated with hot stones from the fire or there are places where geothermal heat naturally warms the ground.
The hangi is used to prepare a traditional roasted meal.
At various places in Rotorua geothermal hangi is offered. Other forms of hangi can be tried in Christchurch, Wellington and in other places.
MetroRail offers two classes in commuter trains around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (known as third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and with less hustle and bustle, but more expensive, although still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has wagons of both Metro and MetroPlus, the latter of which is always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Transportation for others: never lose sight of your suitcases, especially when travelling internationally.
It could happen that you're being used as a drug smuggler without even knowing it yourself, and that's gonna get you in a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in line, because drug dogs can be used at any time without prior notice.
In some countries, even the first criminal offence is subject to extremely severe penalties, which may include prison sentences of more than 10 years or even the death penalty.
If you leave your bags unattended, you can become a victim of theft and, moreover, they can stand out with the authorities who are afraid of bomb threats.
There's a good chance you're immune to these bacteria at home because of the constant exposure to the local germs.
But in other parts of the world, where the bacteriological fauna is new to you, you run much more risk.
Bacteria also grow faster in warmer climates and can survive longer outside the body.
And so you face a 'Delhi Belly', the curse of Pharaoh, the vengeance of Montezuma or one of the other nicknames of the disease.
Just as many people suffer from breathing problems in colder climates, people in warm climates have more bowel problems. In most cases this is very disturbing, but not very dangerous.
Always take into account the potential for major cultural differences when travelling for the first time to a third world country, or somewhere in the world where you have not been before.
Traveling in an unknown developing country can easily be overwhelming by all the small cultural differences that quickly accumulate.
It may be wise to make use of Western-style hotels, food and services, especially at the beginning, until you are acclimatized.
Be aware of the local fauna before going to sleep on a mattress or mat on the ground.
If you go camping, you should bring a camping bed or hammock, so that no snakes, scorpions or the like come near you.
Fill your house in the morning with the rich smell of coffee and in the evening with relaxing chamomile tea.
During a staycation you have time to indulge yourself and to prepare something special.
If you are in an adventurous mood, seize the opportunity to squeeze or mix smoothies:
Perhaps you will discover a simple drink that you can make for breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a varied drinking culture, you can go to bars or pubs in neighbourhoods where you do not often come.
For those who have little knowledge of medical jargon: there is a difference between the English words 'infectious' and 'contagious'.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacteria, fungus or other parasite.
A disease is contagious when it can easily be transferred to someone else near the infected person.
Many governments demand that visitors entering their country or residents leaving their country be vaccinated against various diseases.
These requirements usually depend on the countries the traveller has visited or will visit before.
One of Charlotte's strengths in North Carolina is that there are huge and high quality opportunities for families.
Residents from other areas often mention family friendliness as an important reason to move there and visitors with children can often enjoy themselves in the city.
Over the past 20 years, the number of child-friendly opportunities in the centre of Charlotte has grown explosively.
Families in Charlotte generally don't use taxis, but in some cases they can be useful.
An additional charge is charged for more than 2 passengers, which may make this option unnecessarily expensive.
Antarctica surrounds the South Pole and is the coldest place in the world.
Tourist visits are pricey, require a good physical condition, are only possible in summer (from November to February) and are limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
In summer, a few thousand staff live here at about fifty bases, mainly in those areas. Only a small number of staff overwinters there.
The Antarctic interior consists of a bare plain under a layer of ice 2-3 km thick.
One time special flights go further inland, mainly for mountain climbing or to go to the pool where a large base is located.
The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a route that is 1,600 km long and runs from the McMurdo base station on the Ross Sea to the South Pole.
It is compressed snow with crevices that are filled and flagged. You can only drive here with specialized tractors and sleighs with fuel and supplies.
These are not very agile, so the hiking route runs with a large detour around the Transantarctic Mountains to get to the plateau.
In winter, smooth roads, sidewalks and especially stairs cause most accidents.
At least you have to have shoes with good soles. With summer footwear ice and snow is often very smooth. Some winter shoes are not even good enough here.
It shall be a cartridge with a minimum depth of 5 mm (1/5 in) and if it is cold, the material shall remain soft enough.
There are also models with studs and special accessories are available for when it is slippery: fits on most boots and shoes, on heels and/or sole.
You have to have heels that are low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered on roads or paths to get more grip.
Lawines are not a strange phenomenon; steep slopes can only handle a certain amount of snow and the excess snow comes down in an avalanche.
The problem is that the snow is sticky. It takes something to make it come down and snow coming down can pull the rest of the snow with it.
Sometimes the original cause is the snow warmed up by the sun, sometimes it is due to some more snowfall and sometimes to other natural events, but often there is a human cause.
A tornado consists of a rotating air funnel of very low pressure, which draws the outside air inwards and upwards.
They generate high winds (often 100-200 miles/h) and can lift heavy objects into the air that are carried along as the tornado moves.
First they come down like air ducts from thunderstorm clouds. Once on the ground they are called 'tornados'.
Providers of a personal VPN (virtual private network) offer a good way to avoid political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
For a few reasons, they are better than web proxyes: instead of just http, they divert all Internet traffic.
They usually offer higher bandwidth and better quality service. They are encrypted, making it harder to monitor them.
Media companies regularly lie about the purpose of this and say they want to prevent piracy.
Actually, regional codes have no effect on making illegal copies; a bit-by-bit copy of a DVD will do just as well on all devices as the original copy.
The real aim is for such companies to gain more control over their markets, as money must play a role.
Because calls are routed over the Internet, you do not need to use a phone company that is located where you live or where you go.
You also don't need to apply for a local number from the municipality where you live; for example, you can use a satellite Internet connection in the jungle of Chicken in Alaska and choose a number that indicates that you are in sunny Arizona.
Often you have to buy an international number separately, so you can be called by PSTN phones. Where the number is registered, it is important for the people calling you.
Real-time translation apps: applications capable of automatically translating whole segments of a text from one language to another.
Some apps in this category can even translate texts on signs or other objects to other languages when the user keeps his or her smartphone for the object.
Translator machines have been greatly improved and now produce more or less correct translations (and less often gibberish), although some care needs to be offered, because it is still possible that they are wrong.
In this category, one of the most prominent apps is Google Translate, which allows you to translate offline if you have downloaded the desired language data.
When you are not in your own country, GPS navigation apps on your smartphone are the easiest and most convenient way to find your way around.
You save money because you no longer have to buy new tickets or buy a loose GPS device or rent it from a car rental company.
If you don't have a data connection for your phone, or if you don't have it, it won't work or it won't work.
Each neighborhood store is filled with a confusing assortment of prepaid phone cards that can be used in pay phones or for regular phones.
Although you can call with almost all tickets anywhere, some providers specialize in offering favorable call rates for certain groups or countries.
These services are usually accessible via a free telephone number that can be reached free of charge from many phones.
Rules for regular photography also apply to video recordings, possibly even more so.
If it's forbidden to take a picture somewhere, you don't have to make a video of it at all.
When using a drone, you need to check in advance what you are allowed to film and what permissions and additional licenses are required.
Making a drone fly over an airport or crowd is almost always a bad idea, even when it is not forbidden in your neighborhood.
Today, prices for booking are almost always compared first, rather than directly with the airline.
It sometimes happens that you pay totally different prices for the same flight from different airlines and it may be worth comparing the search results before booking and also looking at the airline's website itself.
Although you do not need a visa for a short tourist or business visit to certain countries, as a student you often stay longer than a normal tourist.
Generally, you must apply for a visa in advance if you want to stay abroad for a longer period of time.
Student visas are generally subject to different requirements and application procedures than ordinary tourist and business visas.
In many countries, the desired research institute must provide you with an offer letter and demonstrate that you have sufficient finances for the first year of study.
Ask the institution or immigration department of the country where you want to study for more details about the requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, when you work abroad, you usually have to file income tax in the country where you are established.
In each country, income tax is structured differently, allowing tax rates and scales to vary considerably between countries.
In certain federal countries, including the US and Canada, income tax is levied at both federal and local level, which allows the applicable rates and discs to differ widely between regions.
Although there is normally no immigration control or it is only a formality when you arrive in your home country, customs control can be a big hassle.
Make sure you know what you can and cannot enter and declare everything that exceeds the legal limits.
A good first step in the world of travel reports is writing for an existing travel blog website.
If you have mastered formatting and editing on the internet, you can later create your own website.
You can really make a difference when you volunteer while traveling, but it's not just about caring.
If you want to get acquainted with a new culture, get new contacts and develop yourself, living in another country and volunteering is a good option.
It can also be a good way to stretch your budget and be able to stay somewhere longer, as much volunteering offers a room and food and some even offer you a small salary.
The Norwegians reached the Black Sea and Caspian Sea via waterways in Russia. Part of this route is still useful. You may need a special permit that is difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-East Sea Canal connects the Arctic Ocean mainly via rivers and lakes to the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Wolga. So it is still possible to go through Russia via the Caspian Sea.
Once in the marinas everything is self-evident. Here you will find other boatlifters who will inform you.
In fact, you hang up notes where you offer help, polar bear through the harbor, step on people to ask if you can clean their yacht, try to contact seamen in the bar, etc.
Try to chat with as many people as possible. After a while everyone will recognize you and give you tips about which ship is looking for someone.
Think carefully when you make your choice for a Frequent Flyer airline in an alliance.
Although you may think that you can best join an airline that you use most, you should be aware that the benefits offered are often different and that one airline can be more generous with frequent flyer points than the other, even if they are in the same alliance.
Airlines Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Etihad Airways and Emirates are expanding the number of flights to the African continent significantly and are flying at more competitive prices than airlines from Europe at many major destinations in Africa.
Turkish Airlines has been flying to 39 destinations in 30 African countries since 2014.
If you have any time left during your trip, you can look at how your total offer compares to a world tour quote.
Do not forget the extra costs of extra visas, departure tax, ground transport, etc. for all those places outside Africa.
If you want to fly all the way around the world in the Southern Hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited by a lack of transoceanic flights.
There is no airline alliance that provides all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not provide any crossings).
Everything with the exception of the eastern Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti is under the services of Star Alliance. This is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
You can not only cross the South Pacific and South American west coast with this flight. (see below)
The ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan waged war against the Azerbaijani in 1994.
A new republic was established with the help of the Armenians. However, there is no recognized nation (not even Armenia) that officially recognizes this state.
Diplomatic disagreements over the area remain an obstacle to relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
The Grachtenbelt is the famous 17th-century district around the city centre of Amsterdam.
The whole area is on the UNESCO World Heritage List because of its unique cultural and historical value. The house prices are so high anywhere else in the country.
Cinque Terre, or Five Countries, consists of five coastal villages called Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso and is located in Liguria, an Italian region.
UNESCO has included them on the World Heritage List.
In recent centuries, terraces have been carefully built, from the rugged, steep landscape to the cliffs overlooking the sea.
Part of the charm is because there is hardly any business development. Paths, trains and boats are used to connect the villages and cars from outside the villages have no access.
The different forms of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from French spoken in France, although they are sufficiently similar to each other to be understood by both parties.
In particular, the numbering system in the French-speaking part of Belgium and Switzerland contains some details which differ from French used in France and some words are spoken differently.
Yet all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have learned the Standard French at school, so they could understand you, even if you used the Standard French numbering system.
In many places in the world waving means a kind greeting.
However, in Malaysia, at least in rural areas, it means 'come along', similar to a curved index finger directed towards the body, a gesture used in certain Western countries, and should only be used in this way.
A British traveller in Spain can wave in a similar way to say hello, with the palm pointing towards the waver (instead of the person to whom it is waved), looking for the gesture to come back.
Supporting languages are artificial or compound languages with the aim of easing communication between people who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They differ from lingua francas. Lingua francas are languages that have developed naturally or organically and for any reason have become the dominant form of communication between people with other mother tongues.
At the hottest moment of the day, travelers can begin to see mirages, which makes them think they see water (or other objects).
If the traveler moves toward the mirage, this can be dangerous because precious energy and the remaining water is consumed.
At night it can also be particularly cool in very hot deserts. The risk of getting cold is considerable if you do not wear clothes that keep you warm.
When walking through the rainforest, especially in summer, you have to watch out for mosquitoes.
If you drive through the subtropical rainforest, you only have to keep the doors open for a few seconds while you get in and the mosquitoes are already in your car.
Both birds and mammals can become infected with bird flu.
Less than a thousand cases were observed in humans; in some cases this was fatal.
People working with poultry are most often involved in these cases, but birders are also at risk.
Typical of Norway are steep fjords and valleys followed by a nearly even plateau
These plains are also called 'vidde', or a vast space without trees or boundaries.
In Rogaland and Agder they are generally called 'hei'. This confesses that it is a treeless heathland covered with heathland.
The glaciers are not stable, but streams down the mountain, causing cracks and crevices that can be covered by snow.
The walls and ceilings of ice caves can collapse and cracks can be closed.
Large ice blocks break loose at the edge of the glaciers, which fall down and can tickle or roll over the edge.
The tourist season for the hill stations usually peaks in the late summer.
In winter, however, they possess a different, but equally charming beauty. Many mountain stations get a lot of snow, so you can ski and snowboard there.
Only a few airlines still offer grief rates, reducing the cost of last-minute funeral trips.
These are available from airlines such as WestJet, Air Canada, Delta Air Lines and, for a flight from the US or Canada, Lufthansa.
In all cases, you book by phone with the airline.
