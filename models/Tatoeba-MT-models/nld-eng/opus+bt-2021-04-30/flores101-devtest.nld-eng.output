This not only proves the already widespread theory that in any case certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also offers more details than fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional placement.
. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-coloured underside.
The find also gives insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or a rachis, but have other characteristics of feathers - such as hooks.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that these were not used to fly, but to control the temperature or to control what it looked like. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this monster shows adult feathers rather than the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster had an adult's plumage and not the down of a chick.

What is consistent is that it is deep holes in the ground', said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, there is hardly any technology required for voting: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope stating which candidate they vote for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter. Then the voter shoves the envelope into the ballot box and then puts his signature under the ballot role.
The process is relatively closely defined in the electoral law of France.
Voting buses must be transparent since 1988 so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Four skiers of the women's group for the incumbent slalom could not finish their rides and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to place themselves during the race.
The stolen laptop and cell phone were recovered by Madhya Pradesh police.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the Swedish woman's rapists have been arrested and found her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was inducted into Great Yarmouth, at James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for killing her son.
She is in custody pending the charge and trial, but the eyewitness report may have been covered up because her story has been published frequently.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have labeled the publication of photographs as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photos of suspects etc."
Crown Office is overall in charge of prosecutions and has indicated to journalists that no further statements are made, at least until charges are made.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians wanted on the basis of the borders before the war in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley after signing an agreement for ten years. However, the PA is only prepared to attend for five years.
Shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was followed and its effectiveness assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen gunmen for the first shooting operation have had extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore a nine-member new provisional electoral council (Provisional Electoral Council of CEP).
With this, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the past four years.
Last month, the presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous National Electoral Council, which is part of a package of measures to ensure that new elections are held in the country.
The committee was set up by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose due to the absence of elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
About 60 cases of failed iPods becoming overheated have been reported. Overall, this resulted in six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) indicated that it was familiar with the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called 'not serious'.
'Very deplorable', was the Ministry's response to the fact that Apple postponed the report.
Mariana was affected by the earthquake at 07.19 pm local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The Northern Marianas' Office of Emergency Management stated that no damage has been reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former police officer from the Philippines has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists.
Several hostages have been taken to safety and at least six fatalities have been confirmed for the time being.
Six hostages were previously released, including the children and the elderly, and the Philippine photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an older woman who had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was eventually shot.
Liggins went to work in medicine and followed his father's example.
Trained as an obstetrician, he went to work at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working in the hospital, Liggins conducted early-birth research in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of the foetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua has reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna died on the night of two moons, as unique as she was, a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1400 people questioned for the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Demissionary Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in this poll supported this position, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last prince of Australia.
29 percent of respondents felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end 31 percent said that that should never happen.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal swam the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relay games at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was questioned due to his complaints.
He could not take the medication he needed to ease his pain, because they are forbidden at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the currently greatest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water coming to earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to be able to understand the way planets are formed. They especially want to know how the earth originated, given that it has been a long time since comets collided with the earth.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated earlier this year as governor and signed a law last month that legalizes marriages between same-sex people.
He called the gossip "political nonsense and gossip."
It is speculated that he intends to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to take shorter routes, saving millions of tons of fuel annually for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technologies with ground radars, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and they can provide pilots with clearer information.
No additional transport is used and no aboveground trains stop at Wembley; in addition, the parking spaces and the P&R are not accessible on the site.
A possible lack of transport increased the chances that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science was about the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process lasted much longer because the cross-breeding of an indigenous Darwin finch, the Middle ground finch, with an immigrant Cactus ground finch, the Españolaground finch, lasted longer.
Gold can be processed into many shapes. It can be rolled up into small shapes.
It can be pulled into a narrow thread that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
After being made very thin, it can be glued to another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books called 'enlightened manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You already make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the coal juice then changes from the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) to the chemical.
The amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical tested shall indicate the pH value.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, make your hands wet and clean and make a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewer system.
Waste water supplies have been found in houses in the Minoan cities in the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
There were also toilets in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. For example, toilets in the Roman era were often part of a popular bath house, in which both ladies and gentlemen gathered together in a mixed group.
When you call someone that's thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
Once the space satellite receives the call, it will be returned immediately.
The satellite has been shot into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and image.
To power a satellite or telescope in space, you have to have a huge rocket that is more than 30 metres long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing that the wheel has given us is a easier and faster transport.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are medium-sized cats between those prey of average size eating, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as loose cats kept as pets) hunting for larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has that makes them not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males that are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behave almost the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats), and which are very lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not good), swim, jump large distances and have five times as much pull as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cat-like ones are the only ones who can roar.
A tiger doesn't roar out of full power like a lion. It's more like he growls a whole sentence.
The favorite meal of oceanots are small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if possible. Ocelot hunts almost exclusively for animals that are much smaller than it is itself.
Scientists suspect that oceanots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by smelling on the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark through night vision and move very unobtrusively. Ocelots hunt prey by making themselves one with the environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) are separated from the large population from which they originate (e.g. by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island, from where they cannot easily return), they are often in a different environment than before.
Other raw materials and other enemies are present in this new environment, so the new population needs to change or adapt in order to cope with competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called species formation and simply involves the formation of new species. Species formation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that inhales people and they take carbon dioxide that exhales people.
By photosynthesis the plants extract their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain of that time. He had nothing to fear from anyone except other Mosasaurus.
His long jaws had over 70 razor sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning nothing or nobody could escape him.
It's not certain, but it was possible that his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, big fish, other mossosaurs and perhaps even his own kind.
Nothing was safe from the attacks in water parties; also giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their portion of strange or unusual delicacies, including boars, peacocks, snails, and a kind of rodent called a sleep mouse.
In addition, there was another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but rich men liked to hold a banquet together where they lay on their sides during dinner.
Roman times do not contain food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, nor did any ancient Roman ever eat a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods, and this temple was seen as the own house of that god.
They offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with the organization of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a backroom that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes towers were built as part of the temples in the form of pyramids, called ziggurites.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family often took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests and therefore wood was very expensive.
According to Norwegian sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on its way west and gave its name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimo tribes there at the time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the persons, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different.
Perhaps after the film National Treasure, you think there's a treasure map behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is based on a misconception. There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original American Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776'. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one is sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (of 293⁄4 inches at 241⁄2 inches) has been rolled up earlier for storage.
So it seems that the designation has just been added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the subsequent fighting, northern France was liberated, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy-France. These were Frenchmen who joined the Germans in 1940 and thus fought with the enemy instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had freed southern France in just two weeks, then they set off for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together in a society.
From Latin civilization, meaning civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which then stands for citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state; and that also defines the format of society in a certain way.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed on over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced spread.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence. Thus, they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states under the articles of the Confederacy formed a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, because there was no national executive or judiciary and for the execution of all decisions relied on state authorities who often refused to cooperate.
Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and tariffs between states.
First, all states had to agree unanimously to the articles before they could be adapted, but the states did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team worldwide, is the second most successful team and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup football.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, sword fighting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with Honshu as the largest island), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of Japan's cluster/group of islands, Japan is geographically often referred to as a "shaving island"
Taiwan's history begins in the 15th century, when seamen from Europe sailed along the island and named it Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in southwestern Taiwan as a base, where the VOC handled indigenous grain production processes and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by men of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated into the Qing Empire province in 1885.
After defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, in which sovereignty over Taiwan is transferred to Japan, which rules the island until 1945.
Built up of three large structures, the Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like before.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had recovered, and the renovation is still ongoing.
For example, worldwide the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analogue film era.
These are produced to this day, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the image sensor took over from the digital camera.
Oddly enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, at a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (parts by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would be 3:2 in that case.
Many common formats (e.g. APS-like layouts) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which is widely misused and which is found ridiculous by many, is a simple directive which makes the image dynamic, and yet also straightforward.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This way you divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under attack.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has linked European states, despite language differences and differences in habits.
From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervading power affected everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that prosperity must be used to combat suffering and poverty and the church has resources for this reason.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to doubt whether this principle was being respected.
Britain set up a blockade at sea against Germany, just after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, because it was no longer possible to provide vital services to military and citizens, but this blockade violated the generally accepted international law laid down in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has placed mines in international waters, so that ships could no longer sail in entire parts of the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to the country's unrestrained submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After World War I, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work with the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a poetry collection and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) for Thomas Edison with him.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
Also between the different dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, this took place in the 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
At that time, violent wars took place between several nobles who fought for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the age of the Three Kingdoms is recorded as one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in battle for the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution has had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism and the view that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
For all male applicants, post-revolution functions were available, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same goes for the army, the army ranks are no longer based on one's class, but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class into a revolution in other countries.
Muhammad was intensely concerned with superearth issues. He often went to a cave for reflection which later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountains of Noer.
The cave itself, which has endured the tooth of time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave is located on one of mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not at all easy to find. Once inside the cave there is total isolation.
The only thing to see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. There is very little of this world to see or hear from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one left of the seven wonders of the world.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and belongs to the countless large pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Plateau of Giza or 'pyramides of Giza' in the Egyptian valley of the dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the great sphinx.
The large pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in tribute to the women and relatives of Khufu.
The up-bow character looks like a V and the down-bow character looks like a staple or a square whose bottom is missing.
Upstairs means you have to start at the tip and push the bowstick away. Below means you have to start at the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the bowstick) and put on the bowstick.
An upward movement usually gives a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the liberty of sketching your personal signs, but remember that the printed string marks are there for a musical reason, so they usually have to be respected.
A group of market women was behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They drove back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by jolting and threatening mobs threatening the King's couple.
Due to the actions of the crowd of people, the king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard murdered in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism with regard to the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were imposed on the U.S. colonial regime to pay tax to finance much of the costs and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
U.S. imperialism largely rested on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
In order to understand the Templars, one must know what the context was that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the high Middle Ages. These were succeeded again by the late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology offer or technological obligation to a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic that is linked to scientific laws and its appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a trajectory that largely extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a rural road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars, which is why new production methods are being developed so that the cost of car ownership can be reduced.
Massive car ownership also increases the number of road accidents and this leads to the development of new health care techniques to restore the human body.
The romance included a large part of cultural determinism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography formed the individual and, over time, customs and cultures arose following this geography, which formed a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrary laws imposed.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from about 400 A.D. until about 1100 A.D.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time Paris also took over the title of fashion capital of Constantinople.
The Gothic celebrated its heyday in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was strongly influenced in the beginning by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments was the result of the Crusades: people began to use knots to attach their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture with the aim of living is a simple system that is usually organic. It uses stored seed that comes from the ecoregion, combined with changing crops or other relatively simple techniques to make the yield optimal.
In the past, most farmers worked in self-sufficient agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures ensure that like-minded people who feel neglected by social standards are brought together, thereby enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can distinguish themselves by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be determined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization was the few regrettable cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, setbacks or wilful abuse during growing up.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned, because the parents did not want to accept the child's serious mental or physical impairment.
Unruly children may have experienced serious child abuse or serious trauma before leaving or before running away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A savage child who has not been raised by humans may show behavior similar to the behaviour of the animal that has cared for the child (within the physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Learning on a project basis should simplify education and make it more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or who are starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. For example, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the Microsoft Office paper clipman.
There is virtual scaffolding that is built into the software that asks questions, provides memory support, and explains procedures that may be difficult to understand without help for students.
There are several reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not cared about and where they cannot develop, but this is happening.
We regard the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Foster care is intended to provide safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the Internet, parts of interpersonal and mass communication are merged.
The different characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, 'Learning' and 'socialization' are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'permanent relationships' when they investigated public responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to remarkable findings in interpreting micro-expressions, that are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that no one can recognize a lie by looking for micro-expressions only.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how it is possible that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can yet accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret people’s behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
By mutation, new genetic variation is added; by selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, separation and recombination vary between the two groups.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of man can easily extract the necessary amino acids from the plant sources that can be found there.
Furthermore, failure to observe can have serious consequences: undergrowth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest to find vegetable sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) slightly digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way as chimpanzees on the savanna solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall asleep within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to your consciousness without waking up immediately.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. This way you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
For example, other options based on the biorhythm are drinking a lot of liquid before you go to sleep (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic).
The amount of inner calm a person has is opposed to the amount of stress a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Every man is able to achieve satisfaction and total rest.
Everyone can ease his or her mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its foundation in the teachings of Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism has expanded with the mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple nucleus of kundalini-yoga, meditating and following universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualised images, the energy of Kundalini-yoga (light energy) is generated.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as a focus. Using the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleaned up, chakras are activated and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, a cooperation between the USSR and the US was established. When the war ended, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to fight.
The former allies faced each other two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war was to last 40 years and fighting with proxy armies took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defence forces lasted only until 17 September 1939, after which they had to withdraw and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans had become obsolete in one night, when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after they occupied the eastern parts of Poland. This was contrary to the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-attack treaty and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Freight transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the Navy's job to ensure that a country retains the ability to carry persons and goods, while the enemy's ability to transport people and goods is hindered.
The US tried to get troops and material across the Atlantic to the British and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII this is one of the most notable recent examples.
The German Navy simultaneously tried to stop this traffic using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats were domesticated for the first time in the Iranian Zagros Mountains some 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always easily get her, flesh, milk, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area. They were then guarded by goat keepers, like the more well-known shepherd often a child or younger. Today, they are still kept in the same way.
Horse railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although horse tracks consisted only of a rail of boards, the horses had to run faster and pull larger quantities than on the somewhat difficult roads of that time.
Crossbeams were used quite early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
This soon became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear and tear on the wooden coach wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767 the first fully iron rails were constructed.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when the Homo Erectus came up (that means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, was less likely to walk upright.
Fossils from the Australopithecus of 4.2-3.9 million years ago found two-legged specializations, and the Sahelthropus, by the way, was possibly on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement, or even take action to alleviate future suffering somewhat.
It is in many cases similar to symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have obviously profoundly changed the earth, and overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle have exacerbated the problems.
After the declaration of independence was passed by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten design was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away. This design was signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon gave the document's public lecture for the first time on 8 July in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July and read to his troops in New York on 9 July. Another one arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap blanks are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that there is still a dinosaur species today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind of a dinosaur.
On their legs are claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their two rear legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary digits forms the basis for almost all the computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that no immediate diagnosis can be made.
The presence of open boxes of medicines or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for that precise poison.
This insect group is formally called 'bugs' by entomologists.
This term derives from an age-old similarity to bedbugs, which are insects that can very well parasitize on man.
Both red predator bugs and bedbugs are nest bound, they have adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the US, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disorder in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, the spine, and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice as much chance of getting MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
When adopted, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works using the scientific method is the main purpose of science, which is the guideline for most scientific research.
However, it is more than just experiments; a test is a test to rule out one or more potential assumptions, question and make observations, as a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
The views of Aristotle regarding science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as the knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioural observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that go through a cycle for a certain period of time, even if no external signals are issued for this.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out. In one experiment the DNA in the faag was marked with a radioactive phosphorus and in the other experiment the protein of the faag was marked with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germ orbital cells.
Only mutations in germ orbital cells are hereditary, and other mutations can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit nature reserves because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On the spot one can hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, go to parks and study the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to, photographing and learning about the orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small villages go by car to their workplaces and pass through people whose workplace is located in the village where they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow in contact with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that because of this enormous carbon economy, the biosphere is no longer in the stable state which allowed human evolution to take place these past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rare in comparison.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do things go wrong every day? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
In the case of a traffic flow, the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between the individuals are considered.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate the traffic flow, because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave fairly predictablely, which means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that there is something to be said about this in the mathematical field.
Links have been established between the three core characteristics to better reflect traffic management: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design and operation of road engineering facilities.
Insects began to fly animals first, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape enemies and find more efficient food and mating partners.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
Currently only dragonflies and May flies cannot collapse their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, and so did the Sun (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river and carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth and has a width of six miles in some places.
At least 20% of all water that flows through the rivers into the sea comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although building stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already over a thousand years old.
There are around 800 inhabitants living in the Vatican City, the smallest independent country in the world and also the lowest population.
The Italian language is the language of official communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People know the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is quite easy to mine them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he has also theorized that they pass into new substances to form into what we see.
Alloys are simply a combination of at least metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are covered by the metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metal elements, e.g. carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil for many people was a faithful friend when it was launched.
Unfortunately, the pen is reduced in status and is much less used as newer writing methods have emerged.
Today, messages are written on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You can ask yourself what will happen to the keyboard as soon as something new comes on the market.
The atomic bomb works according to the principle that it takes energy to assemble a core with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and when the core is split up again, part of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable core, which means that at least or least they fall apart.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the plateaus.
There may be more mares on the side, because the crust there is thinner. Lava could easily get there to the surface.
Content theories aim to find out what is moving and what is appealing to people.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
With these theories, they want to examine the reasons why certain people want to have certain things and what environmental factors influence them to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are the need pyramid of Maslow and the Motivation-Hygiene theory of Hertzberg.
In general, two ways of dealing emerge when managers take charge of their former colleagues, and in one way they try to be equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to take unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, conduct evaluation interviews, delegate and appeal to people on their responsibility.
On the other side of the spectrum, it transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she gets the feeling that they need to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to make everything their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Often this behavior leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are minor differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first contact point for their direct physical group.
Often they are more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One of the goals for putting organisational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity are revealed when all available resources are effectively deployed within the functional departments of an organization.
The result is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order to enable innovation in an organisation, management must stimulate a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning.
According to Angel (2006), organisations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition, thus reducing the scope of research and gathering more accurate data.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and behavior helps scientists during their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injury, traumas, wounds and tumours can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
As there are more and more new technologies, we are increasingly learning about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately reminds most people of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior is covered by research into AI.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is frequently used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class. Often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible. This allows students from the classroom to view the artifacts in a museum, see inside an aquarium or see beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a fantastic way to look back on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students of Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned every year and whose previous versions are kept online to serve as scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students to write better. Often their grammar and spelling are still bad at first, but change this quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and thus avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to learn more about the world around them. The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Logging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond traditional school day.
In good use, blogs can 'help students develop analytically and think critically; by actively engaging in the discussion on the internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own position in certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums in which Canada is exhibited in the past and the future.
Further south you will find the Niagara waterfalls. In the north you will find the beautiful untouched Muskoka and more.
These things make Ontario in the eyes of outsiders typically Canadians.
Further north, large areas are quite sparsely populated, and some of these areas are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in the area of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands consist of independent countries or are connected to France and they are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also took the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the cape route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders south and west to the Atlantic Ocean and north to the Sahel region.
Women: Women travelers are advised to say that they are married, whether or not that is true.
It also helps to put rings on (not too expensive looking rings).
Women must take into account that cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they see as intimidating and that it is common to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and do not be afraid to stand up (cultural differences do not justify this!).
The modern town of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meriniden and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755 they left the city again.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and called it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other hebbeds, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano spewing lava and was buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, for visits outside Goma you must check the state of affairs regarding the fighting going on in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city is the base for the climb of the Nyiragongo volcano and you will find some of the cheapest trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
With boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) you can move on Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
'Timbuktu' is relatively poorly accessible and is therefore used today as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although the city's reputation makes it a tourist attraction and features an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to desert storms.
It was one of the main stop spots of the PBS exhibition Special wonders from the African world of Henry Louis Gates.
The city is different from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arab appearance than an African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Krokodil River.
19,500 square kilometres is the park, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wildlife species are held.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the parade horse of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and access costs apply.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card. These offer either access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and that is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The large number of buildings made up of Hong Kong's skyline has already been compared to a shimmering bar chart visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the waterfront of Kowloon across the street.
The vast majority of the population of the island of Hong Kong lives very close to each other on land won along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers have settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, then you can start right here.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and extend from the coast 80 km (50 miles) to the Indian and Bengali interior.
The Sundarbans are now officially listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The section within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove marshes — they also have some of the last powerful pieces of jungle that ever covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is peat and marsh.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve since 1966 and in the area are now estimated to be 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axishertes.
During the day buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (against the river). Most leave between 6.30 and 7.30 hrs, especially in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days earlier, because the local buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses drive that are comfortable and robust.
With shared taxis one can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French-Guyanian city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge is the crossing height of 15 meters. In August 2011, the construction of the bridge was completed, but it only opened to traffic in March 2017.
According to the planning, the bridge is fully operational in September 2017. Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use.
The Guaraní was the most notable indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now East Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also did self-sufficient agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, lived in Chaco Province, which found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly also called 'the great province of India', was created in the 16th century when Spanish settlers met the indigenous population.
A three - century colonization period followed among the Spaniards.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the largest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here you can also see smaller tournaments and matches at other times in the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FFP). The value is about one British pound (GBP).
On the islands there is only one bank, in Stanley opposite the shop FIC West. Here you can redeem money.
In general, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands and in Stanley you can also often pay with credit cards and American dollars.
In the remote islands you probably cannot pay by credit card, but probably with the British and American currencies. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
Return your money before you leave the islands, because Falkland’s currency is very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is located below the equator, so if it is summer there, it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures are still higher than +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never falls below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rain level remains about the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are ultimately just wild. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep in the park at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
Elk, bison, reindeer, bears and about all other large animals can attack you, however tame they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with nearly 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Around the year 1850 Apia was founded and it is the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US and Great Britain did not want to leave the port, which later became known as the notorious stalemate.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed at a non-violent meeting in the city.
There are many beaches, especially because of the two ports of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches in North Harbour district stretch north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
At Waitemata's port, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes busy and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer has the name 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
Local drinking water can simply be drunk safely, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
All year round, trips to the reef take place and injuries due to these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of Town or 1770. Sometimes they also occur outside this period.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack people. Most of the sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Pre-booking ensures peace of mind with the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other types of accommodation, such as a camping spot, via a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transport to and from the airport and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also retain your reservation if you want to think about the offer a little longer or if you need to acquire documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or wish to make a change, you must do so via the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of those present at music festivals choose to camp on the spot and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should be early to get a camping spot near the music.
And remember this: even when the music is finished on the main stages, music may be played on other parts of the festival grounds until the late hours.
For families whose children are still young, there are special campsites at some festivals.
Be careful where your cabin is when you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, because the trip through the ice makes a huge noise. if you are too close.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time to explore the city. Passengers from the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually work to get the most out of time and the money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are normally not present and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They normally have special offers in the areas of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic drinks. However, when people are drunk, this affects their judgment and all seasoned gamblers know that it is extremely important to stay sober.
If you go up high into the mountains or go over mountain passes, you have to remember that there can be snow or ice and the temperature can be very low.
On icy and snow-capped roads there is little friction and it therefore drives different from asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get stuck.
Also, visibility may be impeded by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and traffic is not hindered by this.
The largest touristic African attraction are safaris, which are the highlight of their journey for many visitors.
The term safari refers in popular use to travel across land to view the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and a standard equipment allows for a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need binoculars, or the odds are slim.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'loop safari') means that you walk several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some parts are played at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city where the Olympics took place twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000. Normal tickets cost around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available. You can often borrow this stuff even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer if available.
Make sure that the substance does not become too hot (this may cause the substance to shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
You can purify water in different ways. Some ways are effective to counter specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in other areas water should be boiled for a few minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt you can drink the best water from a sealed bottle of a reliable company.
Travellers may face animal plagues that are not in their own country.
Pest can corrupt food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Normally infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill people, are not considered to be vermin.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods that are exempt from tax and excise duty at certain locations.
Travellers who go to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected via the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, you often drive through abandoned behind ground and that makes this trajectory one big challenge.
Aren't you used to driving on country roads? Then keep your head. You come across many steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp curves.
The set maximum speeds are remarkably lower than in previous and consecutive areas — usually about 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h — and it is even more important here to stick to them than usual.
Surprisingly, you have a lot more reach here than in other corners of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste fine and in Bavaria the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like the pastries of the southern neighbour, Austria.
You see lots of fruit dishes. Throughout the year the pastries contain apples, and in the summer months also cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and taste fine with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but powerful pastries, try some that are called in the Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen region.
To make a curry you need spicy and spicy ingredients, in combination with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry may be 'dry' or 'wet'.
In the interior of North India and also of Pakistan yoghurt is often used in currys; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is an overarching concept for a variety of regional cuisines from all over the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javan cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers several simple spicy dishes. The most common Javan flavour makers are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javan coconut sugar) and various fragrant herbs.
Mount mounts support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also cause problems with safety because the feet of a rider can get stuck in it.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but remains with the foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders first wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety brackets. This allows a stirrup leather to come loose from the saddle when pulled backwards because a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination in Chile. It is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many large granite walls and rocks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all parts of the world constantly discover new routes on the rock walls that seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports where you descend, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down on a snow-covered descent with skis or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many fanciers, sometimes called 'ski bumpers', who plan whole holidays around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating to 5000 BC!
The beginning of ski sport dates to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational resort in Australia was opened by Noren.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, skitouring or skihiking.
It's not quite the same, but it looks like alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is done a lot on steep terrain. You need a lot of stupendous skis and boots for this.
You can see the ski route as a hiking route.
In good conditions, you can travel bigger distances than walking, but it rarely happens that on laid out slopes you get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travellers between different countries have to apply for visas several times and undergo passport checks.
However, the Schengen area functions almost as one country in this area.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo a passport check again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which products are antiques. Some tax offices give goods over 100 years of age the definition of antiques.
The definition may vary by location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to consider artisanal products as antiques, despite being newer than similar mass products.
Among the Sámi, keeping reindeer is an important form of livelihood. Also, the culture surrounding trade is very important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer farming. They were involved in fishing, hunting and similar things. In this case reindeer were usually used as migratory animals.
Many Sámi work today in modern occupations. In Sápmi, the Sámi area is a major source of income.
The word 'zigeuner' is mainly used by non-Roma. However, it is often considered offensive because of the associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If a travel advice applies to the country you want to go to, this may affect your health insurance for the journey or your cancellation insurance.
In addition to the advice of your own government, you can also consult the advice of other authorities. However, their advice is aimed at their own residents.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions contain only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often give a volatile, general and extremely simplistic picture compared to other, more detailed sources.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur around the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary according to geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Signs and consequences of heavy weather include, for example, strong winds, hail, large amounts of rainfall and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterhooses and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and duststorms include examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travellers are strongly recommended to be aware of the risks posed by severe weather conditions in their environment, as they may also influence some travel plans.
Anyone wishing to visit a country considered to be a war zone should be trained professionally.
A search for 'course in hostile environments' on the Internet probably results in the address of a local company.
In a course, all issues that have been explained here are usually dealt with in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role games, lots of first aid and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles on survival in the wilderness. However, there are few publications about war zones.
Travellers who have planned a sex operation abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for the return journey.
It varies widely whether governments want to provide passports that do not mention gender (X), or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the benevolence of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
In addition, investigations into security controls have become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery may assume that they do not come through this scan with undisturbed privacy and dignity.
Mui currents are the recurring current of waves breaking on a reef or something similar and flowing on the beach.
Because of the underwater topology, the return current is located in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can arise.
Most of the deaths are caused by fatigue by trying to swim against the current, which could be impossible.
When you escape from the strong current, swimming back is so pecked.
Try to focus on a place where you will not be caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you are noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a less great 'marriage travel feeling'), it takes longer, and it can be more intense.
Travellers who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then return, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your own culture.
In the past, when you went abroad, you found that people were patient and understanding, because they understood that travelers had to adapt in a new country.
Usually, patience and understanding are not expected to be required for travellers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in all silence before the show starts.
Often the sound of sellers and tourists here is always audible. The story of the light and sound resembles that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids is highlighted.
The Southern Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries. They have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is the King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the flooded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula pass into the plateau, after which they emerge again to form the 360 km long mountain range Mount Ellsworth, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain with 4,892 metres.
A satellite phone can be your only option in remote locations, where there is no cell phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to stand outside with a clear view of the satellite in order to make a telephone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where there is a need for external data and communication.
Your local phone provider can provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people who plan an intermediate year to travel and learn.
In particular, school leavers make use of this to take an intermediate year before the university without adverse consequences for their training.
Often an application for an education abroad during an intermediate year can increase your chances of going back to higher education in your own country.
Tuition fees should normally be paid for the registration of these educational programmes.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing.The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the island groups off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the Archipels or lakes.
The archipelagos on the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for every yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their spare time, that the ratio of boats to people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
For example, you can spend several full days in the historic place and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009 you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map Berlin is not near the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flight travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's nothing but a lot of fears that other people have, too.
If you know how airplanes work this can help to remove a fear that comes from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the plane.
Courier companies receive a generous fee to deliver items quickly. For business documents, merchandise or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies could use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they send things by air transport, it may take days on some routes before they are unloaded and come through customs.
Only if checked baggage could be processed more quickly. According to the rules of airlines, there must be an accompanying passenger and that is what you are.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is by counting down a bag of money for this privilege (or even better, by your employer).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for the first class.
There is usually no point in looking for discounts for business class or first-class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know only too well that there is a group of kites who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere fast and comfortable and therefore charge the airlines accordingly.
Chişinău is the Moldovan capital. Here the Romanian language is mainly spoken, but also the Russian language is common.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova suffered an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-appointed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by the members of the UN.

Regular announcements in the subway are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are made by an automated system in different languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known as selfish, rude and arrogant.

The hard exterior of the Parisians disappears quickly when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing it.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this wooded area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are very many different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, the different soil species and the varying altitude differences.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
There are rare animals like the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the aurroin, alongside all kinds of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are obliged to wear a skirt to their knees and their shoulders must be covered.
Usually you get a shawl as a woman when you arrive at a monastery unprepared, but if you bring your own copy, with nice screamy colors, the monk or nun standing at the entrance will laugh at you kindly.
On the other hand, men should wear pants to a minimum over their knees.
You can also borrow it from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed every time afterwards, so you may not feel comfortable with that. One size fits all for men!
Like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (particularly pork) and olive oil is widely used.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, mainly during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available to tastemakers, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Self-employed nouns, like Sie what you mean, always have a capital at the beginning, although they are in the middle of the sentence.

It probably also makes reading easier. Nevertheless, writing is more complicated, because you have to find out whether a verb or adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are spoken, so the statement generally poses few problems.
You have to pay the most attention to the c and the g. The pronunciation of that depends on the vowel that follows.

Reading this introduction to grammar teaches you a lot about the grammar of Persian and helps you to understand sentences.
It's pretty logical that if you know a Roman language, it's easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can soon conclude that Portuguese looks so much like this that you don't have to learn it separately.
Premodern observatorys are now outdated, serving as museums or educational sights.
Light pollution at the time was not as big a problem as today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, better accessible than those of today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the sight of cherry blossom and this has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that's where the concept came from.
The first cherry blossom festivals of Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, which requires you to suppress the tendency to remove even 'only one' species.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Moreover, people who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have adopted many traditions that are part of the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay up all Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it might as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, a Easter wake is often held on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend. The congregations often celebrate a feast at midnight's bell in honor of the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands have come here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of its long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the trip. As a result, the giant tortoise became the most common grazing mammal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since man set foot ashore on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
During the winter the Arctic and Antarctic nights take place, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you can see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
