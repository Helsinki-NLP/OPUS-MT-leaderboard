Members of the National Assembly of Wales concerned that they ‘will be compared to Muppets’
There is an uproar among the Members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that would change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name may seem ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party's National Assembly of Wales said that MWP ‘ rhymes with Twp and Pwp'.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for fools and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid party said that the group as a whole is ‘disgruntled' and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party is ‘open' for the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced a short u.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: ‘It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who are taking the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the option MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
Currently, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have a hard time reaching a consensus, and she will have to submit a bill on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will finally be able to vote on their new title when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of their country's name
On Sunday voters vote whether they want to change the name of their country to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a lingering dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that it would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, has said that he will not take into account the outcome of The referendum.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue, however, that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells Saint Martin's silence, Harlem's are struggling
‘The older people I spoke with said that there was a café and a church in the old days,’ said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to be seen here.'
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
‘People now have social contact in a different way', he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people visit regularly.'
However, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the assets of the churches will not last as long as the leaders expect, ‘and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.'
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that won't help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
‘The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.’
Both churches were once built by a white church church, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church congregation from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church municipality led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers at 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by fire, but when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a carillon.
Father David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon ‘the bells of the poor'.
The expert who played the carillon in July referred in a different way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure' and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carillon in the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would ‘want to pass the cost on' to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese had sent.
Some parishioners complained of the diocese's lack of transparency.
Shark injures 13-year-old diving to lobsters in California
Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy diving to lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Along with some others he paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that the boy was crying because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized that “the boy cried out, ‘I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His collarbone was completely open," saw Hammel as he approached the boy.
‘I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Radi child hospital in San Diego, where he is reported to be in mortal danger.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Beach watch Captain Larry Giles told in a press conference that a shark had been spotted nearby a few weeks before, but that it had been concluded then that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had been seriously injured to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury wants to break through in the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and directs beauty departments where specialist assistants work, such as in wholesale stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty wards are tested in 11 stores across the country. If they turn out to be a success, they will be introduced into even more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood, with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees is also given more space, with display space per brand, as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also re-markets its Boutique make-up, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something younger shoppers increasingly demand.
In addition, perfumery will award the Fragrance Shop in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first was opened in Croydon, in southern London, the second is opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and increasingly buy small amounts of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says the stores will look more and more like wholesale stores, as the supermarket chain competes against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have yielded more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Pharmacy a makeover, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration was ended when a conflict arose over the distribution of income from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments in stores sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain three years ago for a sum of £ 125 million.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: ‘We have completely changed the decor of our beauty department, so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way.'
Peter Jones "raged" after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of Dragon's Den's stars, is furious because TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
Jones and Willoughby's company is sometimes compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby, because she retired from their profitable lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘furling' when Willoughby announced Tuesday at a difficult meeting at the company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts (with a value of as much as £1.5 million) do not allow her sufficient time for Truly, their homewear brand and accessories.
The company is sometimes compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of an estimated £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his vacation homes abroad.
One source said: ‘Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would secure its long-term future, and yield enough for the next decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for shortly.
The warehouse of the main establishment in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now incur further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 along with Capp, and Jones, 52, became Chairman of the company in March.
The two couples often go together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon be M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the program I'm A Celebrity on the British channel ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: ‘We have no comment on his business affairs.'
Hard language ‘and then it was love between us’
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for a remark he made that some people would find ‘unfit for a president', and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
‘I didn't give up anything.’
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the summit meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see an ‘agreemental response’ by the United States following North Korea's first disarmament initiatives.
In the meantime, the United States continues its sanctions to keep the pressure on it, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
‘We are doing very well in North Korea,’ he said.
‘We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results. The missile tests have ended, hostages have been freed and the remains of U.S. military men have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
‘It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, about 200 people would stand here,’ Trump said, pointing to the audience before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer had a home, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for launching international aid.
‘In many cases, unfortunately, it is clear that they are not applying for international aid, which is difficult for us,’ said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure if the emergency workers from abroad can work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster relief agency, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly ill prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh shelters were built to shelter in tsunamis, but along other shores you rarely see them.
That there was no warning sirene for tsunamis present in Palu, even though a warning was in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Also in ideal conditions it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's impoverished infrastructure was one of the key elements of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government is facing a lack of funding, and he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting on the streets, with machetes, arrow and bow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes for impressive equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's target, at the time his team was 1-0 behind.
He tapped left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, towards the top right corner of the net.
He avoided the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,’ said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and ventured an attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked the ball.’
Chelsea was at peace with 1-0 ahead, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues' striker kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, then rushed through midfield to Liverpool's playing half.
Kovacic did a quick one-two in midfield.
Then he gave a nice stabbing pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool plays Wednesday at 3 pm in the Champions League's group stage against Napoli, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea records it in London at 3 pm on Thursday against Videoton in UEFA Europa League.
Death toll of tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, said the national disaster relief agency Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 from last Friday, also creating waves of 6 m high, spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old male on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street, and the body showed stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking the locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has only just started, but I would like to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they may have filmed something via a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential to our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The inhabitants are now told that it will be hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying at the scene.
She keeps saying: ‘How bad!’.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the impeachment, and a third was just outside.
Within the perimeter, a number of officers were watching the apartment building.
Those who have information are asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, indicating log 247 of 30 September.
Statue of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-rel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as ‘fool' and ‘an attempt to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate about removing statues would lead to the visualization of Oliver Cromwell's figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe should be recognized today.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct performance is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and commemorated.'
Homicidal pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to reports in local media.
The man, known only to be the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His artery was pierced and he was covered in blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for inoculation of pigs at a pig stable, on 30 May 2005, in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his nephew from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and turned out to be an open door to a neighboring pigsty.
According to the nephew, there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth in the pighouse.
A forensic investigation revealed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
‘My cousin's legs were bloodied and mutilated', said the cousin with the surname ‘Wu', according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On footage from surveillance cameras, it can be seen that Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously hurting the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig pushed a Wales farmer against his tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
‘They’re just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they're not looking to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening now that she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
At a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5am local time on Sunday morning, and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will take 10 centimetres of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden flooding possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as the tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised not to go on foot into the desert when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into ferocious rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small debris flows and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in the rainy season.
Spreaded tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening to Monday morning, after which the rain will spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate strongly, as the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the sustained summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the mid and eastern U.S., October was expected to start warm, with temperatures fluctuating around 30°C everywhere, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees hotter than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the probability of above average temperatures in the eastern United States is high until mid-October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday one of six television networks watching the touching testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault reportedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday's surprise: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Arizona Senator, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she is 100 percent certain that a drunk Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in an animated testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen probably watched on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for the other networks that sent out the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking into an office.
By comparison, that's about like for a playoff of a football game or for the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which fully supports Kavanaugh's appointment, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS registered on Friday morning that protesters shouted at him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of Commission for Justice.
He stood with his eyes knocked down for a few minutes while being reviled, live on CNN.
‘I’m right here in front of you,’ said one woman.
‘Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted, ‘You have power, while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and closed right in front of the elevator, adding that he would say more at the hearing.
The various channels broadcast everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by next week, something that the Democrats of the minority insist upon.
Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat among others.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticised her plans to leave the European Union of ‘a political game' with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives for the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's taxes was ‘absurd'.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of manslaughter, said Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
Police questioned Simpson and later stated that he had confessed to shooting Wayde with the result of death.
His bail has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The county coroner in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local residents all contributed to the investigation leading to an arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked local police for their ‘set-up and striving for justice.'
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is ‘capot' and ‘in shock' due to Waydes' death.
‘This is an event you always hope will never happen’, Wade says.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico City
The ash spewed out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater had been picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash had been recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected several rumbles and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital. That is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 on the Richter scale hit central Mexico.
The volcano, called ‘Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence activists fell through with the riot police, while thousands participated in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia which caused the region to disintegrate into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists stopped by the riot police threw eggs and powder paint at the officers, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, skirmishes broke out with the police, and the officers pulled out their bat to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Don't forget, don't forgive', while their opponents shouted ‘Long live Spain'.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions continue to rise in the independence-loving region, a year after the 1 October referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters overwhelmingly spoke out to become independent, although the turnout was low and the people who are against secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region, leading to violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot the night of Friday on Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest along with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia's prospects of becoming independent.
‘Last year we experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was close, it was difficult for them to build on their success this year, since many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity pending a trial of their role in organising the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been stirred up by politicians on both sides.
‘The tensions are increasing’, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional custody since the end of last year, stated that he is taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
‘A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to challenge the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish Government,’ he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after home was rammed with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred on Thursday at around 7.30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves had suffered damage.
A crossbow may also have been fired on the car at some point.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and delivered Steven Gerrard's second defeat in a series of 18 games since he is manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to be at equal height with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed to win an away game this season during the Premiership. They have to compete against leader Hearts on Sunday, who favors eight points on them.
But first the Rangers receive Rapid Vienna Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston remains undefeated. The team has already won six consecutive games in his division, and coach Holt has not suffered any defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston lacks opportunities against strong visitors
Holt's team could have achieved a lead long before the first goal. Their direct way of playing caused all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who caught Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball above the goal.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and awaited his chances calmly and confidently.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
At that time, the Rangers had been holding ball for a long time, but the home team's defense was unmistakable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not had much to do yet.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos caused Kelly to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball against the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a lead by his colleagues from Livingston.
Constantly reaching the penalty area of Livingston, they were barred each time. Twice a penalty kick was denied, one after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomeal' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continue to surpass expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has hardly changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has boosted the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall ran on the tops of their toes throughout the game.
However, the Rangers failed to break through.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they managed only once to beat the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better. After all, they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a shining blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went for breakfast together Saturday (September 29) in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police invoked security reasons when she prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering for the mosque, but many sympathizers came close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10.15 pm local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance crew were present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were identifying the man and will notify his immediate family.
The road is closed at different places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six guards injured in disturbance
Six guards have been injured in a disturbance in a highly secure prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 p.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialized ‘Tornado' guards have been deployed to solve situation, involving eight prisoners in one department.
The guards were treated there for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: ‘Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six personnel have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars for longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin, more than 500 are imprisoned, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison at the hospital had been treated after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to prison for a serious disturbance in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with potentially positive effects on drought areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, because Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy is moving across the southwest of the desert region, which presents risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden flooding before Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday. Monday night it will rain already.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.'
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there 10 cm is possible.
For those areas that are not at risk of flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing, because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of these rainfalls are likely to be favorable, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are designated, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category,' reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa's trajectory reaches the mainland via the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm strikes cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening them.
Therefore, she is expected to arrive in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm Monday in the afternoon or evening.
Heavy rain can fall in parts of Mexico, which presents a significant flood risk.
‘Drop of a total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa moves north across Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the Arizona border Tuesday in the early morning hours as a tropical depression, which then late Tuesday night through Arizona and will travel to southern Utah.
‘The greatest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and southwest of the desert region' said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden flooding and debris flows in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured Saturday at about 4 p.m. local time in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is ‘stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Police are asking anyone who may have filmed anything of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'has suffered under the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
'A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party', Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure Kavanaugh has continually 'suffered under the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the ‘American people’ saw the beautiful and incredible character, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
‘A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognizes one of the most accomplished legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record,’ he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term election.
‘In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I don't take part, but actually I do participate," he said.
‘That's why I'm all up for great candidates.'
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to 'provide resistance and hinder us'.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, told a top GOP leadership employee to CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is rising
In a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, with many being swept away from the ground when giant waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six metres high hit ashore at the moment it began to dusk. Many people crashed and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Bureau for Natural Disaster Assistance BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on land,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the shoreline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
In aerial photographs released by the Natural Disaster Assistance Office, it can be seen that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to quake through aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has increased the tsunami even further, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Some fatalities were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and damage may be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala ‘is completely flat, we have no information at all', Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,’ said the Red Cross.
The organization received a lot of criticism Saturday for not saying that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, one can hear a man on the upper floor of a building screaming in panic at people on the street downstairs to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water plunges onto the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue attempts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport is reopened only for relief and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
Although the employees of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office seek shelter in tents of tarpaulin, Doseba said they passed scenes of destruction along the way.
‘They told me they saw many houses that had been destroyed,’ he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid workers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
‘It’s still a disaster at provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says: ‘O.K., this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.’
When the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, friends and relatives of the missing continued to hope that they would find their loved ones' lives, as in the miracles that people so fond of belonging to terrible natural disasters like this.
Saturday, a boy was taken from a sewer.
On Sunday, emergency workers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
‘As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,’ he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread into the paragliding community and that in the following hours he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages only featured one grey tick instead of two blue ticks.
‘I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,’ he said.
Thieves steal 26,750 dollars during ATM supplies in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole 26,750 dollars from a Brink employee filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver had just emptied an ATM into the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, as Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many persons were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the perpetrators is requested to contact Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter, saying: ‘The creature formally known as Kanye West‘.
The 41-year-old West has been briefly called Ye for a while and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons', says the show's creator.
Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current stage name. Earlier, West said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
I think ‘ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you',' West said earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album at radio host Big Boy.
‘So I am you, I am us, it is us.
I switched from Kanye, meaning ‘the only one’, to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are.'
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love this year.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also worked with and without the hyphen and the capital letters.
Mexican president promises not to use forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatellolco Plaza that he would ‘never use military force to suppress the Mexican people.'
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people. During that period, left-wing student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said young people often join criminal gangs due to unemployment and a shortage of opportunities to study.
United States must double A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on research by A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this following the announcements about A.I. coming from several departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be number one in the field of A.I. innovations by 2030.
‘The budget for research into A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.', Lee said.
A doubling of funding may lead to a doubling of the probability that the next major achievement for A.I. takes place in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order' was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next match would take place, as it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
‘China does not steal our best academics, the companies do that', Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best forces from universities to work on A.I. in recent years.
Lee said that U.S. efforts in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
‘Whoever doctorates in the field of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card’, he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation development plan for artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to academic institution staff, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, intended to involve partners from industry and academia in the initiative, and announced the White House the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence).
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing over 100 million dollars in research into A.I.
However, the US legislation that should lead to the establishment of a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been in the throes of months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change of their country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country’s name to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’, which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been dragging on for decades and would no longer hinder Greece’s Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province which is also called Macedonia and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country is entitled to Greek territory and Greece vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he is not going to vote in the referendum and due to a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required turnout of at least 50 percent will be met, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot paper is as follows: ‘Do you support membership of NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the price to be paid is worth trying to join agencies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that originated when the former Yugoslavia broke up.
‘I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient MPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said that there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at that time was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters came to vote.
‘I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018, during the referendum on the country's name change that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
Before parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people boycotting the referendum.
‘We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back door, Kavadarkov said.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership of NATO will generate much-needed investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
'I am convinced that the vast majority are in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after voting.
He said that a ‘yes’ as a result would be ‘an affirmation of our future’.
An opinion poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
From another poll, conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of that, 70 percent would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came into power last May.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short cuts with Brighton's defense at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the match 2-0.
It seemed like a piece of cake, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker first got the ball played at midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
‘Aguero has problems with his feet,' coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
‘We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playing field.
He sent a beautiful stitch pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player tapped the ball into the net just before he was too far.
City takes it up at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage. The game takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play along and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the playoff
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoff, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Nevertheless, the ever competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the playoff. They are currently leading one game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least a wildcard for the playoff thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now still want to do whatever it takes to ensure their first section title.
‘Although there is nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday's move, but are reportedly inclined to set up Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, stood in the pitch field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term election.
‘Everything we have already achieved is at stake in November.
One of the most important elections in our lives will take place in five weeks.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't participate, but actually I do participate. That's why I'm all up for great candidates', he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take control back, no matter what they have to do for it.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "provide resistance and hinder us."
‘And we have seen that for the past four days,’ he said, calling the Democrats ‘evil and mean and false and lying'.
He named the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Justice Committee, leading to loud bow call from the public.
‘Do you remember what she replied?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I am the newest in a whole series of Labour MPs to get that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the censorship motion because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.'
And that was also the case during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am already a local Labour MP.
Unfortunately, that has not been the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a ‘nicer, softer' politics has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a political outlook similar to mine, suddenly expected that I would turn around and take a position that I would never have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak in front of an audience, no matter what I say, there are abuses on social media calling for my candidacy to be rejected as a Member of Parliament for the next election, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the remarks to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are dealing every day with a torrent of sexist or racist reactions, but do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that bad abuses are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of distrust' or change of selection rules the party becomes more small-minded.
For the past two years, I have often been advised to keep my head down, not just to express my opinion loudly and then I would ‘not get in trouble’.
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I became a member of Labour as a school child 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government by which my classroom literally collapsed, I have always advocated better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a city councillor and in my role as a minister.
I never hid my politics, even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my contentions with current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr on the way to the top
Two late tries may have skewed the end result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr triumphs with justice in this wonderful competition of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the rankings, the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that gave the home team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
‘We've had a hard time so far during our games and we're still undefeated, so I'm a happy man', he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: ‘All credit to Ayr, they have made better use of their chances than we have.'
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, finished by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card by Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors' game) Melrose could have the figures spoken and Jason Baggot managed to break down a try.
Climo provided an extra gap for Ayr with a penalty and scored a conversion after a solo try just before the peace. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long stopped for a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was hauled off on a stretcher, and once the match had been restarted, Ayr could continue to run by a try of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card from Ayr, and again Melrose settled with the extra man when no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a match with the pressure being very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tackled Climo without the ball, MacPherson behind the advancing Ayr-maul provided a touch-down on the penalty-line-out.
Climo provided the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart again, after Kyle Rowe caught the box kick from David Armstrong and halfbacked Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going to the restaurants. Apparently, he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts along with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craig long.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the ‘blooming restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the land-locked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigging naval office in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag flying on public buildings.
At all the naval bases of Lake Titicaca up to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout the country-circled Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country had to give up to Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century conflict of raw materials has still been vivid, as has the desire to revade the Pacific.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should fall on 1 October after five years of debate.
‘Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and naturally looks forward to the result with positive prospects', said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the court's ruling on large screens, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will argue in favour of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of tough talks, is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial struggle for re-election next year, is much at stake with the verdict of Monday.
‘We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,’ he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to grant Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final statements indicates that the case was ‘not complicated', says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, in the last four years the situation has perhaps even worsened.
‘The matter surrounding access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,’ Zárate said.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has completely undermined all the goodwill that Chile might still have undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to continue talking after.
The two countries have not had an ambassador to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will ‘have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile' and an opportunity to ‘put an end to 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits', he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
‘Bolivia will never give up his right of access to the Pacific Ocean,’ he added.
‘The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to put the past behind us.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time when Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's a 'utopy' that the lasting sanctions and the American objection to a declaration that ends the Korean war will one day get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the statement without Pyongyang taking important steps in disarmament first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious when he says he would renounce an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headgear, soon for sale in your area
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your sight, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a notable move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were hard to think away from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their dazzling creations onto the catwalk.
Valentino's notable piece was a giant beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, which hung over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons lined with gemstones, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were sewn shut. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One was like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats are perhaps inspired by 'La Bomba', the scattering hat with a two meter wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a scattering beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit model that sucked the bag.
The red orange raffia bag, deposited with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the most notable piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra-large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with yet another set of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for secondary and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects par excellence within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and a relationship of trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated to SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students German, 69 percent of students French and 63 percent of students Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now as much valued as trade choice as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that of the stumbling blocks to fill job vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are thus becoming increasingly important for preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more job vacancies require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he has a real advantage in the future with such skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive edge.
According to a YouGov poll among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language to exceed 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Speaking several languages, particularly those of emerging economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied at present that languages remain vital to the future of the country in a global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first game at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego in the opening game for the season on Sunday.
It still has to be determined how many minutes he will play.
‘There will be more than one, and less than 48,’ Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six games prior to the season.
‘At this stage of my career, I don’t need competitions before the season to prepare me,’ he said.
Period of Trump election rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a long series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia
It is the first of five planned rallies of Trump in the coming week, including stops in places that are affectionate to him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been put on hold, Trump wants to build up support for the upcoming mid-term election, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when voted in November.
What time does Trump's rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19 a.m.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about the hearings for this week's candidate-appreciator Brett Kavanaugh, who were extra-charged as Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may be waiting for a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November election to get more momentum.
President Trump's campaign leadership said that these five rallies in the next week are intended to ‘promote volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives', Reuters says.
‘Control of Congress is so important for its program, that the president travels to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins', said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named against Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who remains behind in the polls.
‘It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the polls,’ said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging garland of opportunities is a completely invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who's getting the best chances right now?
‘They had a six-point lead at first, and now that's only four more, so we find that luck is on our side at the moment', said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of being four points ahead, while there are twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth said, find that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and scored three points each of the four.
Spieth has been a fearable opponent from tee to green and he sets a good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he realized a crucial putt that made game four a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His putt with which they won the match at 15, was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can derive that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
‘You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game' Spieth said.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to make your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
This curious, but delicious European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood' was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to be exchanging energy with their noisy audiences, they are the players who must be defeated Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to book a European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short stops with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swede that they did not recover.
Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
The European team has played the best so far and has a good lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to enter the fight, something some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday they are ahead of the United States by 10-6.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two wins more than Tiger Woods, who was struggling, giving them up to four points ahead in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who wanted the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine back, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points during Sunday's 12 singles games in order to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed ‘Molliwood', are only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening games after a sensational weekend.
After they had beaten Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they had played beautifully on each other and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a wonderful move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Yet it did not go smoothly for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze to the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans by three points Saturday.
They won 2&1 of Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls after a difficult game and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with a four-point lag at the beginning of the singles, although Furyk's team is enough to tie, as they currently hold the trophy.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says that it will ‘under no circumstances’ disarm unilaterally without trust
The Secretary of State of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions lead to increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could under no circumstances unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the U.N.'s annual General Assembly that over the past year North Korea had taken 'major goodwill measures', such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the location for nuclear tests and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
‘However, we do not see any similar reaction from the US’, he said.
‘Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will under no circumstances disarm ourselves unilaterally.’
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it moves forward, it was noted that he did not a priori disapprove of unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the ‘denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula', while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea aims for a formal end to the Korea war of 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on ‘denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war', said Ri.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our mistrust.'
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the American leader did suggest earlier in the week at the United Nations.
The minister instead stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: ‘If the other party had been South Korea on this issue of denuclearization and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such an impasse.'
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year, when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the US mainland so be directed after ‘Mr Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'missile man' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim this year at the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much remains to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter.'
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: ‘The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and firmly continued until we have achieved the full, definitive, verified denuclearisation.'
The Security Council has implemented unanimous sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just a few hours after leaving Pyongyang in July and saying that progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making 'gangster-like demands'.
This month, in a meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took ‘consistent action’.
He said Kim had told him that the ‘corresponding measures' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor noted that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course. As far as he knows, it is unique in the US.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a speech on the influence of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me saying, 'Why did I only hear this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is organized for the first time this year, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleeping habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was established that students had a serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, students see an image of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine when going to sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long - term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Using a map of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
‘We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we feel that they have the right to know all this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of choosing cigarettes on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride on a night of study still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, of good quality, must be the student's ‘secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course, after which he had attended the professor's class last year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened its eyes and inspired him to ensure that the course became available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, not just an alarm to stand up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, which can make you have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: goal of Menga brings down Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their away game again disappointingly expired when Dolly Menga scored and defeated Steven Gerrard's weak team with 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team hoped for a first win during an away game since they defeated St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team caused the defeat, barely the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 games. His team is now eight points behind Hearts, which continue to run at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored at seven minutes for the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equaliser.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers might get even more trouble, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently an object was thrown at him by the visitors' team' supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team. They crossed Ayr and went to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same team for Livingston, who managed to kick off the Hearts last week. He would have been thrilled by the way his well-trained team managed to block off the opponents at each move.
The Rangers may have had most of the ball ownership, but Livingston did more with it.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga handed the ball over for the first time and Scott Pittman had Allan McGregor's target in sight, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked the rear pole.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to hope for a happy ending rather than really believe in it if they could approach the target.
Alfredo Morelos found at least that he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless collided after fifteen minutes of play, but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's request.
The Rangers could only shoot at the target twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who used to be goalkeeper at the Ibrox, could easily stop Lassana Coulibally's headball and the tame shot of Ovie Ejaria.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in line with the general course of play, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was only because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who easily kicked the ball into the goal.
Gerrard interrupted the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent switch. This move had almost immediate consequences when the winger passed Morelos, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a kind of game Livingston prefers to play, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final stage of the game, but McGregor held well and blocked Jacobs off, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invader Glenn Middleton of the Rangers requested a penalty kick at the end of the game after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way again.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the almanak of our ‘Sunday Morning': 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for those who can TELL ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the aircraft called Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has not been able to think away from science, and also became an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the initially unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘That’s a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you hear the effect of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.'
Evans: ‘It’s really banging right now!’
‘Hans' Geiger died in 1945, barely a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognise malignant cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to modify them in a lab
They can then ‘see’ a protein that is common in many types of cancer and are then re-injected
A test vaccine produces promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted so that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which often occurs in all kinds of cancers. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer', including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar way of removing immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ these cells to tackle cancer cells has been shown to be already working in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West breaks down pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA hat after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't work out as he had hoped.
Kanye West was booed out on a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he was going to be a presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he stabbed a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
‘Many times when I talk to a white man, he asks: ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump? He’s a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony on the Senate Justice Committee in connection with the alleged sexual assault that Christine Blasey Ford accuses him of.
The tirade of West was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded them to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to make fun of West with his post.
West also complained to the audience that he had been shot backstage for his cap.
‘They harassed me backstage.
They said, ‘Don't step on the stage with that cap.'
They harassed me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see what apathetic looks like?’ He said he would put on her superman cape, ‘because that means you can’t order me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the audience, at least twice a bow call came and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard from one present: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.'
West was a guest as a last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest minds: CONTINUES YOU'RE TROTSING THE MASSA.'
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply ‘just himself, and that's beautiful.'
‘But I choose not to reward someone who supports and spits out an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
So did we', added them.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘the creature formally known as Kanye West'.
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg has also worn the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then into The artist formally known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder after stabbing at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast police judge on Monday.
The charge will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington turns to toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor turns to the stereotype of the macho hero and says that young boys often think that when seeing such roles on the screen they have to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he feels that ‘something has gone wrong' and asked himself how the problem of toxic manhood should be addressed in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
'This is really an important question for me personally at the moment: where did our masculinity go wrong?' he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, which now makes us face this problem?"
Kit thinks television might be partially responsible for the increase in toxic manhood, due to its very male characters.
He continued: ‘What is innate and what is learned?'
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys think they have to be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's big questions: how do we change that?
Because something has obviously gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series is over next summer, because he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses'.
From November, Kit will play in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he feels that his encounter with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the show, so that's how I left my future family and my life to it from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series which was awarded an Emmy.
The couple was married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that over 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed on through sex, which was not previously so.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people suffering from HIV in this way is now almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reported to be widespread.
According to studies, due to the conservative values of land, an estimated 70 to 90% of men having sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and turns to ‘dangerous lies' and ‘conplot theories'
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters goes against the allegations that one of her staff members has posted the personal details of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the allegations are spread by ‘extreme right' know-it-alls and websites.
‘Lies, lies and even more mean lies', Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and private phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill at a Senate Committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and contained the information of a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," Waters said.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security are compromised due to these false allegations, was under no circumstances responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
Waters' statement soon encountered criticism online, including by former White House press officer Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds angry', Fleischer wrote.
‘From this you can see that she does not have the temperament to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
He shouldn't rebel.
He shouldn't question the prosecution's motives.
He needs to stay calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of exaggerated anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the mid-term election, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
‘Hefty, if it's true', he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators become known,’ she said, ‘and that they are legally held liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff members.’
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we now traditionally look for references to the Brexit, and that does indeed apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films starring a weak spy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was created back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy evenatire about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with bulging eyes and flexible facial features at least manages to send everything in a hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name you can already conclude that he is a general comic character that was conceived for cinemagoers in countries where people speak a language other than English.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a hint of that guy who contributed one note to the theme song of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (who everyone has forgotten meanwhile) who always leaves behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved the way Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades tap his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson can clearly show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humor seems more intended for children than for adults, and the crazy calamity of Johnny English is less original and focused on me than the jokes without lyrics by the character Bean playing Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making known the identity of all active secret agents of Britain, to the great dismay of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the bucket run over from the Prime Minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character reminiscent of Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she has to deploy a retired spy, as every active spy has been compromised.
And that means the stunting Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but unofficially teaches about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because English's spy classes remind of School of Rock.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic helper Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a tumultuous and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
So the Batman and Robin of the disastrous states of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's blood-beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssee of fun: dressed up as waiters they set on fire a showy French restaurant, they kick noise on board Volta's luxury yacht and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all registers are drawn open, but no matter how well-meaning and boisterous the scene is, she reminds a bit of children's television.
It's all not very original.
And like the other Johnny English films, I ask myself the question: can the British film industry really not think of a role that respects Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour denies that the party is devising a plan in which British workers work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party would consider a radical plan whereby British workers work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party is said to want corporate bosses to pass on the savings they make as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
For example, workers can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea ‘fits into the party's economic agenda and the plans to have the country's balance sheet tilted towards the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was already approved by the Trade Union Confederation, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits in with the party's efforts to have the balance in the economy more pronounced for the benefit of the workers and that also fits in with the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the ambition is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "A four-day work week is not the party's policy proposal and is not considered by the party either."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the "faceless directors" and the "profiters" at utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not regain the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply 'discounts' based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in company boards and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) to give 10 percent of private sector companies’ shares to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the FBI's findings could ensure Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcast at '60 Minutes' on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that might lead to her changing her mind.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be unstoppable.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has vigorously denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will perform and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizens Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international advocators who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
Concertgoers who want to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, e-mail a world leader, make a phone call or generate awareness for the goal in another meaningful way: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 more years to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just another form of 'click ivism', making people feel that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizens, more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters have been registered, aimed at a large number of different targets.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the commitment of world leaders and to policy proposals worth more than $37 billion to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or brought together by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the main declarations of intent are those of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children realise their full potential'. This group has promised $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, of donors, of other national governments and of Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice that is malnutrition a footnote in history," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent asking the British government to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government has announced support for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizens website that was asked "why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
the group replied, "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes falling and failing.
But, like civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will eventually be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform this year at the event in New York presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian exports of energy - Home Secretary
Washington may 'if necessary' resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, stated Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of Home Affairs, as stated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has that ability, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for invited guests during an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that posters itself as the 'voice of energy consumers' in the US.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these do not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less using and replacing fuels" he said and referred to Russia as a country that has only a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that offers by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw sight from the 'unfitted' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trum of Berlin has made Moscow's 'prisoner'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister for Energy Affairs, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about it' to participate in the 2020 presidential election, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator said Saturday that she was "thinking seriously" about participating in the presidential election after the mid-term election.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is thinking about participating in the election.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to repair the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position" she said according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren performs against President Donald Trump during the meeting at the town hall and said he "directs this country in the wrong direction".
"I am troubled to the bone for what Donald Trump brings about in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been candid in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this".
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday revealed that a majority of Warren's own supporters feel that she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to an opinion survey by the Political Research Center of Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent were in favour of running.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with a possible participation in the 2020 presidential election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSD of Track Palin at an election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"Due to what my own son has to experience, what he is experiencing now that he is back, I understand other families experiencing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience attending a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and have become harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other military have given to the homeland".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and has been charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesperson in Wasilla.
Washington, D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new US policy refusing asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. submitted a statement to the Washington Court last Friday as a 'friend of the court' in support of an asylum seeker challenging this policy, NBC News reports.
The complainant's full name in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was then detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people who apply for asylum in the US, as countries that have major problems in gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals from 2014, in which it became possible for immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Washington's Attorney General D.C., said Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignors decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is stated in the statement of the 'friend-of-the-Court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the US harms the US economy, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provided with the necessary labour'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges in June no longer to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available to those who flee their country due to persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political view" said Sessions in its announcement of June 11 of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to ease all the problems, even if these problems are serious, which people face every day, all over the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also got worse and worse.
"It feels very tense" said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while trying to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their devastated homes and searched in their wet possessions for valuables that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and hospitals have been overcrowded, as long as they have not been damaged by the 7.5-on- Richter scale earthquake.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the risk of heavy aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told of his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed against the remnants of a wall," Haris told a correspondent of the Associated Press and added that he was in town with his family for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her or our child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidating' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in an American daily, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were praised, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump recently referred to China Daily's paid attachment in the Des Moines Register, the most-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere with the US election, marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed ever higher import rates on each other.
China's retaliation rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, supporting the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and previously Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had affected American workers, farmers, and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in a Sunday opinion piece in Des Moines Register, "now doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By distributing this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of speech and of a free press, a long cherished tradition in America by placing a paid ad on Des Moines Register" wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, at a newsstand in downtown Beijing you will find in vain dissenting voices and you will see no true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese population may have on the laborious economic trajectory, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article", if he did not say which newspaper this was.
By the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans alienate female voters just before the mid-election, analysts warn
As many important Republicans gather around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him from various allegations of sexual violence, analysts warn that this will result in a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming mid-term election.
The emotions surrounding this subject have grown enormously and most Republicans have already said that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article that has appeared Saturday.
Reeher said that he wonders if Senator Jeff Flake's (Republican, Arizona) attempt to plead for an FBI investigation at the last minute will be sufficient to satisfy the angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they haven't forgotten it tomorrow and they haven't forgotten it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday according to the Washington newspaper, D.C...
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate Hall while the Republicans who have the Justice Commission under control chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it may increase even further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years, who often do not vote even though they disagree with the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she further explained her charge of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pushed the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party" said Michael Steele, former Republican Party chairman, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote on the committee, or about the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes place in court, but it's also about the way the Republicans handled this and how they treated her" makes Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clear to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be divided over the question of who they believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with a small majority signing off on the latter's side.
A new opinion survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony, or probably believe that 35 percent believe Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh certainly or probably lied during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's lead, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford stated to the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of booze when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate has shown her his genitalia during a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, begins a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the technology legend's latest project, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contacts, activity lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment through data'.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to have any conversations with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a full transformation that will completely turn all their business models upside down at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Also after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and bearer of the Victoria Cross from World War I honored
The only cleric of the Church of England who has acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a military man is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the award following the attack at Bellengise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and thus never knew that he had been given the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was 'brilliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather had been awarded.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
He later stormed to the line of fire and led the line forward before running only to a field gun and eliminating three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I can never compare to, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored to be allowed to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to watch a full-blown Bellator 206 and you don't get to see the most important moment.
The placard from San Jose featured 13 battles, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for their fight, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised when the station switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were outraged because they had stayed awake all night especially for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to government regulations, no content that is not suitable for children should be shown after 6:00 a.m., and therefore we had to switch to the children's program" said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the Pig," yess."
Scott Coker, company chairman of Bellator, said they're going to adjust their programming to ensure that the viewers in the UK also get a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the return match, we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of text messages went back and forth and believe me, these weren't all equally friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise this won't happen again.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic beauty jumper Tom Daley says that during his childhood he felt inferior because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary school, he did not realize that 'not everyone is as I am'.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said that he had spoken about gay rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that parenthood had contributed to him attaching less value to winning during the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-term show has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first program, Daley told him that during his childhood he felt 'less' than others because it was 'socially not accepted to like both girls and boys'.
He said, "Until today, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was someone, so he wouldn't disappoint people if they eventually found out about his orientation.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a notable campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others 'hope'.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, 'has completely surprised me'.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much so young", he participated in his first Olympics at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, you won't be there to sit in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I could finally acknowledge that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I'd been dreaming about this my whole life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympics, there's no better feeling" he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, that had greatly seized him on his way to the games and which still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs can be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on couch during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his form again to make it not a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record, was benched by the team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to figure out where it is lacking.
Because he was never known for his straight drives even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs erring balls routinely punishes.
And if the job itself is not terrifying enough, in the ninth match on Sunday Mickelson encounters the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who is paired with novice Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the beginning of the 12 single matches, start well, Mickelson's match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has proved to have confidence in this man, although, frankly, he was difficult to change.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he was ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of faith in himself.
He is inducted into the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to only play two matches.
I expected more from it, but it's the way it is and it's the way we're supposed to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never fully matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games in his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain untouchable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty, he likes to play jokes with people and he's a great guy to have on the team" he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to fool him once in a while last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big lead can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead prior to the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where the team with as Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but eventually passed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, calling off here, after he had seen the 2018 light win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this isn't a game played yet.
Everybody's gonna have to work their asses out tomorrow.
Get back to work and get the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's winning this trophy, and we need to keep focusing on that.
I keep saying it, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoiced at the performance of his players on a tricky golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never anticipate matters in this area.
There's a new challenge tomorrow.
Tomorrow individual performance will be discussed, and that is yet another discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone, your abilities as a golfer are really tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who captured three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of turnaround on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech" he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had pep up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 major matches ahead of us tomorrow, but let's try to get off to a good start, as in Brookline, or as in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We've tuned our line-up to this and we're sending the men out in the order we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try and pull something out of the top hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counteroffensive and deploy Rory McIlroy for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the remaining Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered" said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have come into service in 2014, replacing the obsolete warships of the Cold War time, but it will take at least one more year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit that quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features include longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far away from home ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already obsolete by the time they are put into operation, notes Die Zeit.
The fateful frigate F125 made all the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would render the warship useless if it were deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the boats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are served by a crew of about 120 seamen, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is suffering from a severe overweight, which will reduce performance and limit the capabilities of the Navy to perform further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip are becoming extra important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Parliamentary Defence Commission in Germany, acknowledged that the Navy is in fact "a shortage of deployable ships".
The official said that the problem has grown over time as a snowball, because old ships were taken out of operation but no replacement vessels were supplied.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on an estate in the Scottish highlands, attempts to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland follows the common and small dwarf bat, the brown large-eared bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to track the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Staff of the NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the cries of the bat and what kind does what.
A map of the habitat and a report is then produced to create a detailed picture on a landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes that the results show which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making meadows and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting berths and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightnings can also pose a risk, as can fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
At the NTS, which is responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 acres ashore in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who carry out regular surveys, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Threeave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten species of bats live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for the bats.
"Here in Threeave we have a great environment for bats" he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much about bats is not yet known and that is why the work we do here and at other locations will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, possibly eliminating a full local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or to destroy their sleeping accommodations.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and of many of our species we simply don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects charges of sexual assault while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo qualified allegations of sexual assault as 'fake news' and said people want to 'promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations have been published.
The striker of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports 'fake news' a few hours after the allegations were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by mentioning my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the trade.
I am a happy man, and through and through good" added the footballer, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they called 'unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident has been reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, went back to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, as can be read in the charges filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a 'good guy' for '99 percent', but that he is sometimes abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she has gone to the police and that there have been pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was 'bang for the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says she wants the scheme declared invalid because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged sexual assault and left for Italian giant Juventus this summer in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: the UK 'will regret it forever' as car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its status as world leader in car production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added the 'careful' was that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the event of a 'no-deal Brexit' job would be costing.
The Burnaston factory, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory shut down," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other automotive products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the impact of a departure from the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already indicated that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
Toyota's production line runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars being made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be unrest at the borders that industry believes could lead to delays and shortages of components.
Toyota cannot store more than one day of stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company announced, and therefore production would be shut down in that case.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is 'exactly aligned to avoid those checks at the border'.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only allow us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's listeners.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be shut down, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative for the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can 'be postponed another week' while the fight over the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the election, links between Trump's assistants and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The question of whether Trump is going to fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has been the Washington gossip machine for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to drop off the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumours were circulating that he was about to submit his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein 'liever', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week's investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the entire Senate again.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump's press chief, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by an aversion to the 'attractive' TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
She then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," she said, without providing any evidence, "We have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States direct questions, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot over the past few weeks and that will replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president possibly demonstrated why, he made a candid and at times bizarre appearance for the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes a letter about Brexit to employees of the NHS Scotland from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the desire for them to continue working at the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared its willingness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer the negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and the expected decisions will be taken this autumn.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also increased preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be uncertain times for all of you.
I would therefore like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and that provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after having sustained head injury
The linebaker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation yesterday after suffering a head injury in the 31-27 loss against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tennessean reported.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and sort of collapsed there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff immediately gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, before putting it on him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that 'no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury' and Tennessee State tries to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is at Tennessee State in his first season after a transfer from Illinois.
He has been tackled a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a home in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a home in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless according to new Conservative plans
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn's success to attract young voters
The increase in fees is levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a home in the UK and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success that attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and story this to many earners.
The increase in fees is levied on persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue being invested in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current fee, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and houses purchased for the rental, can go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year in this way.
It is estimated that 13% of the new construction in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foothold on the housing ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spook cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a cut in fees to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable houses in order to restore the 'housing chande in Britain'.
Corbyn has announced a striking series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to expulsion 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister in restoring the British Dream, that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our faulty housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be as simple for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof over the head has become too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says it's his 'ultimate ambition' to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of resurrecting the club from the northeast of England, currently ranked third in League One, in three points of first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership the previous season.
"As a football player, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and with that the stocking was finished" Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child I saw Scotland play often with my father in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps on attracting me.
However, that possibility would not come until I am successful in managing a club."
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a major club, previously he had refused advances by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is currently measured by 'can I have this club returned to the Premier League?'
Due to its structure and facilities at this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not an easy task to achieve this, but I can't see myself as successful until I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months into Hearts' coaching group.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and has transformed St Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career as a footballer with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably really a crossroads" he remembered from the moment he took charge at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I was doing pretty well, I earned pretty well and I had some reasonable highlights.
But playing football can be tough.
There are a lot of things you're confronted with weekly.
I still have that, given the stress and the pressure of the profession, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in the summer has increased revenues from British pubs that struggle to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw revenue increase by 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants were 4.8 percent less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting firm CGA, which collected the figures, said, "Constant sunshine and the fact that England participated in the World Championships longer than expected, meant that July showed a similar pattern to June, when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were now hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the turnover of restaurants in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on liquor sales performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also aimed at selling food members also of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people only went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drinking revenue was 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food revenue was 3 percent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said, "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the entertainment market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent turnover fall year-on-year is particularly painful given the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators who focus on food and only the time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary respite."
The total revenue growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
The Koffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sectors, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some no older than 11, has a secret account for social media, which they hide from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey among 20,000 high school students revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a 'main account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, some no older than 11, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey among 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has increased the fear of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean 'main account' that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who happened to end up on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who asked others to 'rape' her.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to keeping personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are lured to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected the Council of Scottish Athletics, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and chairman Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the directors of the sport to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in Scotland, the UK and the world's athletic community and we are sure that Scotland's athletics will benefit tremendously from its election to the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and help drive the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and the 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terribly hard work, but I am now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thanks for all the support!"
Advertisement for breast pump comparing mothers to cows distributes opinion online
A company that makes breast pumps has divided online opinion with an advertisement comparing lactating mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, producer of consumer technology, has released an ironic, music videos-inspired advertisement to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to cooping mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything of it' and 'In case you didn't notice, these are not udders, these are my breasts'.
The chorus then continues with: 'Pomping, pumping, pumping, feeding the babies, pumping, pumping, pumping, pumping, milking the lady'.
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has directly caused an online controversy.
The video has been watched 77,000 times and has provoked hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that it condones the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of childbirth" is written in a reaction.
Elvie's breast pump discreetly fits into a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else commented, "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another one added, "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she thought the song was 'hilarical'.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
Those pumps made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little weird, but I didn't find out too much about it.
This is a brilliant product" someone wrote.
Someone else had the following remark: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who cuddle (often at the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like they are just 'cows'.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you can see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who coddle sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and discreetly fits into a nutrition bra, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they're at it.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing coopting mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the coop and the associated challenges in the spotlight and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will create an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children tacitly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of inmate migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policy introduced by the Trump government makes it more difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid of jeopardizing their own chances of staying in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their household will have to give their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albience, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, stated in a testimony to the congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the sponsors' sponsors or family members are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
We're in the process of prosecuting these people," said Mr. Albience.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules, forcing some of them to appear in court within one month of the start of detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the staff at the Shelter
Many of them will be in court through a video conference, rather than in person, to advocate their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed to be ineligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may give rise to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to the Shelter staff and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are often ignored, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for this or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the 'occupational force' of the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid Al-Muallem also called on the Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'this will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue with "this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from terror groups and from a "possible illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favorable for their return and he blamed 'some Western countries to spread irrational fears' which kept most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politicize a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available to Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the United Nations say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has averted a large-scale attack by Russia-backed Syrian troops in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that this agreement has 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which 'will be eradicated'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN delegate, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for after the war for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions of the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited 'to reviewing the articles of the current constitution' and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the election in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely by a deposition procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of viewing fatigue.
Since 2014, the ratings during prime-time at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime-time, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' by MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the person responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designated Survivor' a series about a minister becoming president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why?
"He then said 'Because he makes me laugh'," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can influence Roe v. Wade's future or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen, when you notice that you have been watching a panel of experts for the past six hours discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who talk about Paul Manafort's jacket of paucus leather that cost $15,000 ('a garment full of hubris' according to The Washington Post) and who discuss the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
At least I'll never be able to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"What he does to give you the idea that this is a reality show is partly that he stops you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (a fight with the N.F.L., waving Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you feel like you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear himself off the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Justice Commission and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember doing all these weird shows not so long ago, and people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting mid-term election for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an influx of money, thanks to a reshuffle of a constituency that requires two sitting representatives to fight for the same seat.
The recently reclassified district of Pittsburg affects Democratic MP Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb has to take on another incumbent MP, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards have been reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymanding') in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a fight in the field of campaign funding between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democracy Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a well-viewed special election for Pennsylvania's 18th constituency.
This seat had been occupied by a Republican for over ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points difference.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China and abandoned it.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the United States Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in US aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving for the United States.
But in mid - September, some top government officials announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now that Vice President Mike Pence will give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the government's importance to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three American envoys have returned without further ado to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without harsh messages about Washington's sanctions.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss the internal discussion under condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which serious evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on collusion between Trump's and Russia's campaign in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump must answer to himself for that institute, just as he prepares to address the voters again, and perhaps he should answer for a jury in a court of law.
That's a lot of substantiating, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor those of its equivalents in Europe.
Choices will have to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, who will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to execute a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and had supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and therefore missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bending points and the inexorable advance of democracy is thereby accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing various of these bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time when this journal reported that he, last year, had suggested that he secretly record talks with the president and that he had speculated on the suitability of the president for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report isn't correct.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation filed for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term election for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me away, 60 years later, to light candles for the Sabbath on that table depicting a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the game against Rapid Wien
Rangers get Rapid Wien visiting on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, places them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that rash as a springboard to better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out the game with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but seeing about the whole game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it's going to be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last game. But if the audience stands behind us, I'm sure we can push through and we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been tough, of all that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feelgood factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave the past season behind and be successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in Nationwide's research said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation" said Holly Snyder, vice president for life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where we're gonna start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't make your wishes known in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices may be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take in a financial advisor: Your advisor can also advise you on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or deploy equity as insurance, as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when the insurance needs to be used.
Provide a power of attorney for health care, so that you can point out a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that the invoices are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is facing a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Record these details in a written plan, so that you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications are being used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes along."

Officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'random act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that has hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
As the means of communication have been disabled, the official agencies have not yet received information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Agency for Combating Disasters of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed over 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in western Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on north Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of it in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a power of 6.8 on the Richter scale occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that struck on the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the Richter scale hit the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of over 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded around 300 human lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the people were reminded of the destructions of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time but more than 100 people found death due to crashing buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former Governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-Presidentship, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, had been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference on a report of domestic violence and opposition during the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female confessed tried to call the police to report the alleged offences, he took the phone from her.
Palin is held in custody at the Mat-Su detention house with a bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, for sure' when asked this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and to a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B violation, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
This case is now for the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of an assault in the home atmosphere, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin has been criticized by a veteran group in 2016, after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD, which he would have held up to his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just next to the centre of Celebes, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, killing eight persons, a rare punishment that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, was charged with using a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, overturning pedestrians and cyclists who came on his path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'intentionally' killed the eight victims and 'intentionally' inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the declaration of intent demanding the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both counts the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury has approved the indictment with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder on behalf of a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and they described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'cruel, cruel and depraved'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellaevich Sajpov has inflicted injury, damage and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the letter of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been over ten years since a case in the Southern District of New York demanding the death penalty occurred.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was enforced in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after being convicted two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by means of the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his act, she the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room at the hospital, the police told.
He pleaded not guilty to the charges with 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he is 'of course disappointed' with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," said Patton.
Sajpov's defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilise a 'people's army' during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians should feel the 'heat' of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants in the Birmingham march that the UK would have been 'out already' if Mr. Farage Brexit minister had been.
But the challenge facing May in reconciling the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise on the ride while this is being attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Supporters insisted that she will continue and will try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw 'Chequers into the trash basket'.
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he left the service, we'd be out now," Bone said.
The Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers into the trash basket."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said, "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely false."
Conservative Brexite Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote in favour, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go door to door and make sure we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen to me."
In a targeted message for May, she added, "Premiers keep their jobs, when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'hit' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with this'."
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: "I want you to lay the fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilise the people's army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become another independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this march with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the founding of this group on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the upper house for Labour, made jokes about the security problems of a party app of the Conservatives at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a full farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "think well" about candidacy for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she will 'be thinking well about her candidacy for presidency' after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told of her future at a meeting at a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican delegate who co-chaired Trum's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she might fight Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
An attending asked her if she would run for president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our faulty government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after killing Wayde Sims of LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported Saturday that a suspect was arrested after shooting Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the film.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and died from its consequences" police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has confessed to being present at the scene, having been in possession of a firearm and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started in 10 games last season. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory after team orders
When Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that team orders of Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely out of it when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits and made Hamilton drive in the crowd in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came up again after a wheel-on-wheel action which reluctantly forced the Ferrari rider to release space on the inside after a double movement in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then was the race's leader for a time, as he stayed on his tire selection and aimed for fast finish, so that he could catch up with Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth spot.
Eventually he went to the pits in the 44th round, to he could not raise his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman and he let me go.
The team has done so best for the places one and two" said Hamilton.
That wasn't good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday election meeting about the fact that she persisted in not being the source of Christine Blasey Ford's leaked letter, accusing the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Justice Commission. Instead, he indicated that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be 'meaning, unkind and untrue'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that takes place in the Senate the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and unkind and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer... did you leak the document-- 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak" he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter listing the allegations to Kavanaugh's address was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein has denied that her desk was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to deal with it confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president turned out not to believe her denial and he commented at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power, with all necessary means.
You see the meanness, the unkindness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to seize power and regain control" the president would have said according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars v Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return game with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals in charge by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team side by, before Dwyer put the Giants back in charge.
Francois Bouchard made the equaliser for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make up for a backlog on Friday night to then defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The opening goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist by Kendall McFall. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt put forward the proposal for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants with a lead went into the first rest, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team repacked and Bouchard brought them again to an equal position with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He provided the victory with the fifth goal for his team, half way in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, making sure hundreds can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died for ensuring that an aircraft with hundreds of people on board could safely take off.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-and-again moving control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at that time ready on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart, when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll may rise to thousands and the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"People assume the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six metres have destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is wrapped up in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the military present, "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, with more than 550 people dying.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline carrying out the flight which has crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one more man is missing, after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with the local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the remaining passengers and crew, after the plane had been hit by water during the landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what the exact sequence of events is remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane was shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he himself and some others managed to wade through the water, which came to their means, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors working in the vicinity at a yard also helped in the rescue work by taking people to the coast with an inflatable boat, before the plane sank further into the about 30 meter deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the past twenty years, 111 people have been killed in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG, but none of them relate to Air Niugini.
Analyst records the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed his requisition on Friday in the reopened trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a few hours of testimony as a witness expert on information analysis.
He made clear to the jury how he had used the phone call records to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she left life.
Rowlett said that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was on the stand on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told me he was at Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was 'logist because my truck was then in Nashville'.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they only met one week ago.
Rowlett said that Tellis erased the texts, calls, and contact details of his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to be able to begin deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hip hop'?
A hip hop trio wants to question the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argue that hip hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hip hop' again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had another revival in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A nanny from New York sues a couple in court for a 'racist' text
A nanny from New York sues a couple in court for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a missent text in which the mother complained about 'again such a black'.
The couple denies being racist and calls the lawsuit 'extortion'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a black woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
'NOWAY AGAINST ZWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs Maurice twice.
According to the U.S. newspaper, the New York Post dismissed Plasco-Flaxman’s feeling of discomfort when she realized her blunder. She stated that their previous nanny, who was African-American, had done bad work, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a work day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice takes the couple to court to get a compensation of $350,-- a day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bifurcate internally with the family, although without contract.
'I want them to feel that you just don't do something like that', said Maurice in the New York Post last Friday, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple got away with the claim that she is racist by saying it was reasonable to fire Maurice after, being offended by her, being afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists', husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who had offended you, even if it was an accident?"
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on.
About comparing the lawsuit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That's not very sympathetic', added the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion is quick to captivate the couple on social media, where they are bewitched for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not be very interested in a talking bear, reveals new emerging letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's approval, said of the letter: 'It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's enormous success, it's very entertaining.'
She told that her father who, before being inspired to write the children's book about a little toy bear, worked as a cameraman at the British station BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication felt 'bittersweet' after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she told, that her father was secretly proud of the final success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so lifelike to him, it almost looked like an achievement of a child; you're proud when you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he sort of experienced Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for success.'
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter had been taken to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that people expected her not to make it', said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
'Then Nad's call came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly wore off and left her body.
She had passed away some time before, and this trial shut everything down.
I could only sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't cry, scream or cry, because I was in the midst of all kinds of people and families.
I had to keep really big."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the death of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Robbing women stick messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have been lost by suicide make themselves strong to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like how I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45 and residing in Lydney in Gloucestershire, England, relates that her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room."
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deeply depressed."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm always worried about a chain reaction coming."
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep quiet - talk about it.'
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling bleak or depressed or anything," she said.
'A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all grounded on Christmas Day - when the kids unpacked their presents he didn't look at them at all.'
She said his death was a major trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: 'It rips the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we must all continue and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain while FBI investigates
'I thought, if we could indeed get what he is asking for; an investigation limited in time and size, we might be able to create some more unity again', says Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart, amid a firmly anchored stalemate within the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The mid-term elections are already in five weeks' time, on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country are severely complicated.
George W. Bush has already called members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus met his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes the report?
Then there will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice President, to cast the determining vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean defectors has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, which quotes from data from the South Korean Ministry of Enabling, states that there were 1,127 defectors last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park noted that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers were the main factors in the decline.
Pyongyang didn't respond in public.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often violently expels them.
Relations between North and South, which are still formally in a state of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, mainly discussing the stagnant negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the US, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, agreeing to work broadly towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Secretary of State, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
'Without faith in the action of the US, confidence in our national security is also lacking, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament', said Mr Ri during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called candidate judge for U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like that, people would call her 'hysterical',' Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally the allegations that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes nearly screamed and was particularly upset when he told about his family and his high school time.
He also emphatically condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him 'great and coordinated character murder', organized by Liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
'I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and by the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats', says Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when asked if she would try to institute an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he were appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
'I can say this about that; if he is not telling the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he now serves', Pelosi stated.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the court of the 'District of Columbia' (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would vote against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (law on affordable health care) because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh circumvented questions about reviewing certain Supreme Court decisions during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to stand up and cheer when a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed to the Supreme Court', says Pelosi.
Women just have to give in to this.
It is a righteous tirade of months and years of pent-up anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We're gonna cry when we get mad," Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was a supervisor somewhere and who told her that she too would cry when she got angry. She developed a method, in which she would cry every time she got angry. To the one she spoke to, she said: 'You may think I am sad because I am crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried on.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partially permitted as an expression of anger, because crying is fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my best remembered memories from a former job, in a man-dominated office, is when I cried terribly because I was very angry. An older woman, a cold business manager that everyone was a little afraid of, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never show them you're crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an illegitimate affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'cat evil' or 'ape regions') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not run herself.
'It wasn't a deliberate decision', she told me laughing 30 years later.
'There were already 7 other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone mentioned "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind in fundraising, and so she solemnly promised not to participate if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give $1,000 to men, only wanted to give her $250.
"Do they think I might get a discount?" she wondered.
When she delivered her speech announcing that she would not start a formal campaign after all, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she choked on it.
'They must have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,' Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to her.
'They must have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the US-China trade war can be beneficial for Beijing
The opening alvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and although the struggle has not yet been fought, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the US president, gave the first warning earlier this year by increasing taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week became known when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for 200 billion dollars (150 billion euros) of goods; half of all goods coming from China the US.
Beijing has taken reprisals each time in kind, most recently by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the US every time, and the world's second-largest economy is likely not to blink fast.
In order to bend Washington, requests must be met, but public bowing to the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the US could positively support China in the longer term, as the mutual dependence of the two economies decreases.
'The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could lead one of the two countries into an economic free fall is indeed far more dangerous than spectators have previously recognized', said Abigail Grace, a research officer of the 'Center for a New American Security', a think tank specializing in national security issues, which focuses on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, said Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war lasting over seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Secretary of State, Walid al-Moualem, stated that conditions in his country improve.
'Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism', he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and normalize the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that around six million people are still living in the country, who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team won the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was wrestling almost the entire tournament, allowed his long battle from the tee to land in the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all its rounds and became one of four players who once made 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest scoring of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest ranked player on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play to Ian Poulter from Britain, who possibly played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so easily, but there's nothing I can do about it today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help', said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole to go in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The huge pride I feel for beating Tiger Woods, I've been following this guy all the time growing up," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the greatest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at high level throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing performance: 'I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
For a short time this morning, we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We resisted.
All due respect for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players on his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
