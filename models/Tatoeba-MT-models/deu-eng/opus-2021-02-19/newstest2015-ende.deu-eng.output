The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, will meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko to discuss economic and security relations on his first important visit abroad since his election victory in May.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world's third largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunt
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued driving on Burgess Road before taking off into the bushland where the officers lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The Karratha police accused a 20-year-old man of disregarding a stop signal and reckless driving.
He is to appear before the local court in Karratha on September 23rd.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read out at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, asleep, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reconsideration of the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights.
"Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I proudly present the Employee Empowerment Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as on other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-unionist forces.
The addition of the National Labour Law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a union representation, to sue for justice before a civil court - and to receive compensation or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have been facing in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries across the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and comply with labour laws.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojo would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that the workers and their unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the workers' rights to unification and to collective bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve labour and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or trade.
Agreements which restrict or aim to reduce this right are null and void; measures aimed at that are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors provided a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union - and that this union would then be allowed to participate in collective bargaining as an equivalent partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights came under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to recall the American ideal that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representation - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America great in the past and that have redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close down
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge temporarily halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana, of which lawyers say that it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was made law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is to enter into force on 1 Sept., would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to legally carry out abortions for the time being while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while trying to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing will be held for the judge in order to bring about a more permanent decision on the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the recent decision in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would take so much more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana escape a devious law that wants to take away their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the complaint and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures to be unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that admission rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion object to the fact that the measures are intended to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has a patient’s right to receive evidence, the Centre for Reproduction Rights reported.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop doing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patient registration rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video hommage for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural areas in Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan from the QiMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk was 20% higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-diseases as well as social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had progressed further at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counter the distances, she suggested, as a possible remedy, a strengthening of the service of flown-in doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women with more dense care at their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical status, the study revealed a poor long-term survival rate in women with ovarian cancer, underlining the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years of age, learned from the Gold Coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret declining homeowners
The decline, along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under 35, could result in the loss of tens of thousands of pounds a year in garden centres when today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products" according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people spend on their own homes for their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting front gardens for park purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors threatening the industry, where an estimated £5 billion is being implemented annually in sales.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens do not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for RHS, said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when they move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retailing due to rising house ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and clergyman Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but now broadcasts again.
At the same time, some 3000 demonstrators tried to get to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence.
About a kilometer away, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
Meanwhile, the country's army calls for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without using violence".
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already pushed more frequently.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary elections last May.
The protests escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to enter Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey appoints US diplomat for espionage report
The Turkish State Department has requested the country's senior US diplomats to provide information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the U.S. ambassador and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that those of the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a main area of activity for the US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying on each other.
A previous report that also targeted Germany's main intelligence service, Ankara, caused the Turkish government's reactions to be much more upset.
Warning strike: Train drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the locomotive drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The delay announced for 6 pm to 9 pm concerns all transport companies nationwide, including the long-distance, regional and S-Bahn traffic,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

said Sven Schmitte, the district chairman of the trade union Deutscher Lokomotivführer (GDL), in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There were no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences.
Chief of Police of Magaluf accused of corruption
The prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the Office of the Attorney General of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Binge-Drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after allegations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the Office of the Attorney General for Anti-Corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said that the nepotism of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Keep our livelihoods out of play.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a drunken tour of Feltatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the disorderly behaviour of alcoholic vacationers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcoholic pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Feltatio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organiser Carnage have to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British tourists, is also known for a number of alcohol-related accidents, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The Frühling has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong wind affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m. another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already gone down in the night to Sunday.
The final rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a casting that started just before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After last week's winter caused an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell back to a peak of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The bad weather probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
At that time, winds reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to take off on a second approach and finally set up at about 8:40 p.m.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: High time for great networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech control centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my view falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there's one thought behind it: If the cable wasn't, all the listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be much more retro.
In any case, on the disgusting (eclectic?
No, typo: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And if you still have a tube TV in the living room today, for example, you simply say that you reject television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the push of the Ifa at the Funkturm this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The layman, who once blindly dominated the washing machine and CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread in front of him with incomprehensible expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you all right?
What do you want to talk about with people who seem to be volunteering to spread that kind of quark?
Basically, for about 20 years now, it has been all about linking up our house.
In order for the yogurt to reorder itself, so that the fire alarm on holiday in the Maldives informs us that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we had the air conditioning from the office on our arrival soon...?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We lift our watch, say loudly "eyes!" - and at home the vacuum robot drives off.
Crazy.
Everything amounts to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring", an industry expert enthuses, one can connect the washing machine with a headphones, the steam cooker sends the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but this does not help because we are in traffic jams.
We also know from daily practice: If a new-style device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio shows.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after spending the summer in air raids, while rocket and mortar fire fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in the south of Israel, marked by rocket bullet holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff of the Pashosh Kindergarten, hit by a rocket, removed shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a bit scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a cease-fire broke the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border city with Gaza, which is heavily marked by Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' call for the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea ports.
Israel calls for Hamas to be disarmed and for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting to be handed over.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to start this month in Egypt.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the struggles continue, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be open again soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl calls NPD prohibition proceedings into question
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has declared itself in favour of an end to the ongoing NPD prohibition proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should be brought to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is doing worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU Landeschef in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a gratifying development in the right direction and a development that allows me to conclude that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had barely failed in the vote on Sunday at the five percent hurdle.
A first attempt for a ban on the far-right party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection at that time also had informants in the top NPD.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neuländer Platz refugees are now accommodated in tents.
The central initial reception for refugees in Harburg bursts at all seams.
Now the Internal Authority has put up three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were informed only shortly before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to arouse public reservations and do not give district politicians the opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Green Party in the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party demands that the Harburg district administration make available unused houses for housing.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial admission are the rush of help seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
Domestic prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
RP Data research manager Tim Lawless announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tiered market.
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, compared to 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless further said that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in real estate for sale over the next few months, which would "be subject to a real test" in the market.
"Looking at the consistently high auction price rate, a generally rapid sales rate and the persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of the Managing Director Peer Medau and attests to his posing "like a general".
This is not the style of the university, according to the communication.
For example, the Medau family had already been informed orally about the idea of the university in the middle of June.
The statement that the plans were only known in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not "preliminaries or even decisions", but that there were "preferentialities".
The extension of the narrow road up to the castle, which was necessary for the access, was also less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
There was and is no mention of a nine-meter-wide road.
According to the current situation, it is 5.50 metres wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The Medau operators' argument that their free and school-owned parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future, Pötzl does not want to apply.
Train parking is not at all, because this can now be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the Residents
According to the university president, the Bergwichtel crèche, which is located on the grounds and would lead the access to the parking deck at the front door, is not to be affected.
Rather, he points out that "this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring Realschule.
So it's about much more than particular interests of Mr. Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents' advisory board of the Kinderkrippe, with the expansion of the street one "of the few natural spots of Coburg will be lost" is justified, "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Authority, intends to inform the city councillors about the development of the university's buildings by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the crèche about the plans of the university.
According to this, the access to the new parking deck should not be via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but via the Medau-Berg.
This would require a two-lane extension of the narrow road to about one kilometre in length.
According to projections by the Medaus, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There are about 2,000 vehicles a day.
From the side of the city they did not want to comment on the project so far.
Glandorf resigns from the national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga club SG Flensburg-Handewitt led for this decision mainly health problems.
The decision has not been easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," said the 2007 World Champion on his Facebook page.
He thus retires internationally with a balance sheet of 167 national matches and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the kicking back room player wants to go for a few more years for the Champions League winner from Flensburg, he is no longer available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a "long and good conversation" with the Icelander, who announced his squad for the national matches against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have thrilled me just as much as they will inspire my longtime fellow players and my successors.
But I also want to be available for my club in the next few years in a healthy way, for this longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-handed had to fear his career end in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilless tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later caused a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career go by no body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot operations, which took place at short intervals in 2012, I never got my blood pressure properly under control.
In addition, there are some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I can control my head, but I can't fool my body," explained Glandorf in an interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback, he would only be available in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes are torn, I am always ready to talk," explained the two-time father of the family to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I want to be able to walk at least a little straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and winning the Champions League 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he won the European Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrunk by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have slowed the German economy down in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed by provisional calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong start to the year, the first half of the year has a GDP increase of 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest cycling tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
With their registration, more than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour through Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were happy about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration in the club home of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the Wall, where the start was also made.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On distances of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were served on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor's representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a great experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came, as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on August 30th or during another weekend", but the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organisers are planning a new edition.
Constantine Wecker's mercilessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-container, put on paper in "Monch and Warrior" on 287 pages.
The Munich-born on June 1, 1947, wrote down his memoirs not chronologically, but rather more bits of thought for bits of thought, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text.
And he is unrelentingly honest: From onanie as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave out any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also takes in abstract but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom of, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he not only influenced music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving out all unnecessary things".
But there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the high-spirited views: for example, about fights in a local frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, in which he aimed at a tree frontally.
Again, he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful of his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already adults when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket punch.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was that serious guy in the corner reading the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than his father's, he gained an insight into what life might have been like for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep stygic mazes with flames and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lay down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him sing because he could wash the foundry off.
As I was walking around, I realized that he had been doing this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It wasn't until the end of my mother's life that we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop "I love you" sometime?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I did this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been taken by the theater.
It followed The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his busy working life.
He started working in a factory when he was only 16 years old.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote about him on New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black impersonator/commedian on TV for quite a long time."
He learned at work.
I had to grow up not only in front of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
It was very unpleasant for my family.
I kind of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
Through the introduction of figures that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among others as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just taking the time or stepping a little on the spot."
After that came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, white in tights and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't mess up if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do it.
It was almost like someone finally put my head right on me.
"That's what it's all about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lyrics, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, "You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they're fixing the computer."
Instead, the stage director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That too was good, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONE voice.
So I'll stick to it.
I really love this.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is permeated by humorous outbursts, while he imitates people time and again.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy, because I think this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you're going to drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo when I feel like doing it, but overall, I don't have as much as I used to.
I'll ask him if he'll ever make another stand-up comedy tour.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give that up again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between the Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman for the Houthi Party, "Ansar Allah".
The access to Parliament had also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the Yemen Post newspaper, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for action on Sunday night.
According to the paper, Huthi threatened to escalate the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni Yemen and demanding the resignation of the government.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps along the large access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers civil servants to contain "spiritual employees"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically in order to remove "spiritual employees" from the government's payroll.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would not be paid any more, was a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive pay payments after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the civil service when he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month of payments for "spiritual employees" and other abusive financial practices were lost.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been reported in a government message.
All those who would not do this without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the communication continued.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of civil servants and also clearing the payroll at both levels of government - so the "spiritual employees" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be tried for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are demanding damages of EUR 19.4 million from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
That's what a court clerk told me on Monday.
The application states that Achenbach had cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
For 44 years he was in school service, 23 of which were headmasters.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many of Petershausen and Kollbacher from their time as pupils.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his desire to see man in the disciple.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain in the Krkonoše Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in teaching after four years of secondary school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, we went to Bavaria - in the freight wagon in 1946.
This is how Richter moved to the Upper Franconian town of Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometres to the next station six times a week, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometres across the whole city to school and back in the evening.
After two months Manfred Richter got a bed in a red cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954, after three years as a teacher, the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken had no free teaching position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The Fräulein Room was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a regression in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew up, and from September 1982 onwards, the children and their teachers were able to move into today's building, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional work room built at municipal costs and during the expansion in 1997 cellar rooms, although this was not eligible according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter remembered gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a presentation by a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn: "It doesn't always work." Whether he only means his students or his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Richter's doing was sometimes unconventional.
When students fought each other, they did not get a criminal job from him and were not thundered into detention.
At the expense of the community, Richter had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was supposed to be a violet.
For the good of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship as rector with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the partyless judge to be the last to run for the municipal council on the CSU list in 1996.
However, Richter was elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists make stopovers in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists take a rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of riders alone made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later an open-air party in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Raddle and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 km via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by the mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind all sorts of good things had been prepared: The rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 tins of apple, plum, sprinkle and cheese cake, which wonderfully filled the capable cyclists.
"Only rural women can bake such cakes," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while he ordered another piece.
Cold refreshments could be bought at the drinks stand of the Geiß-Nidda gym.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and won enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already fixed off bicycle chains again today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the plant manager still had to work: They were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking spa by reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise for Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Promotional director Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004 as tour leader, could only briefly take a breather, as he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squadron of the police in three telephones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region," he said, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they left after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short breather.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS) the park had received a beautiful festive atmosphere and of course they had prepared treats, such as flamed cakes with well-cooled feather whitener.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, Managing Director of GTS Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors in his role as a board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move in the open air was eagerly used despite the sporting activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests were increasingly citizens who were attracted by the good mood as well as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the programme for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," reports local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reporting Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly establishing an organized criminal association and tapping telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergyman Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There he informed waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksandan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, visited Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here again and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
It arrives with a proud drag of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own frontal experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., whereupon she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearson's media world.
She served as Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the senior position of Pearson's parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Their severance was allegedly almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Councilman.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust acts in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost untenable duopoly, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new chairman would risk coming in, attacking everything and dissolving an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps killing himself with his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC downsized - power, money and status out of date.
As competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC poses particular dangers.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year, the British public buys into the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each of them only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: nowadays I get news headlines on my phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that disparaging tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official Texas Republican Governor's account, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a disparaging remark about the Democratic District Attorney, which is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another from Perry's user account, which cancels the previous one.
Just a tweet has been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the tweet and have deleted it," it said in the later message.
Perry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although Perry's official user account was based on tweets, it was not clear who was actually using the feed.
The previous tweet drew an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of driving drunkenness in April 2013.
Perry vetoed funding from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment of Perry - who might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - in front of a grand jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet reads, "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level ... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry when he talks it out."
I'm the most drunken democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of the Grand Jury's investigation into Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal advisers asked the case judge to dismiss the indictment and argued that the law that is being used against the senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is located in Travis County and is investigating state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa Elections during his presidential election in 2012, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, saying, "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley once again declares housing market "normal"
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England was "returned" to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly sought after and subject to huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013" and added that this offers a "stable environment for action".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the cadastral authority, prices in the urban area have skyrocketed by 18.5 percent last year alone, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average sales prices at Berkeley's private, low-cost, and student offerings rose by about one fifth last year and amounted to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a possible "vill tax" before the general elections next May.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, which presented tighter lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on a already weakening house price awareness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now declined by a quarter year after year, according to real estate agent WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due for future sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, future sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than at the peak in 2007 prior to the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40 percent annually to £ 280 million, while sales rose by 18 percent to £ 1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday prior to the Company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley is expected to meet current market expectations in the current year.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to be £450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at £23.96 in London trading this afternoon.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscar Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and sued the hacker for "declared violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will pursue all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly procured by Apple through a gap in the iCloud online storage system. The alleged "masterlist" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It's not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim vs. the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are really happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied, however, that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called naked pictures of me are FOLLOWED, people.
Let's fight back the beginnings.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel on love and the letter "J".
They melted, so one could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box, which one left in the rain.
Occasionally a woman told him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distanced and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
He was prickly, like hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim of this stinginess was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a property in a wet but paradisiacal valley with the apt name Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, there were spiders in the baths, nudibranches had left their marks on all the windows and believed that all of this belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house of a children's fairy tale, both menacing and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deckchairs in the high grass and had enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had mentally absently locked themselves into the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen to at home with closed roller shutters.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - simply not played.
It has been successfully obsolised, just as the word obsolise.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have achieved, and how people choose the from-plate-washer-to-millionaire-memoires, cookbooks and romance novels in books, so they chose ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a coarse-comic serenade of Ailinn's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, as he had said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It had not been a very funny game back then, and it was not very funny even now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even though it was not strictly forbidden.
Improvising was no longer modern.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be sure where it would end.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed in mind.
Although he was 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints applied.
A conforming society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - gratefully as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were looked after with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewers; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WHAT WAS GRANTED WHEN IT HAPPENED - for fear of being accused of fire-fighting, for fear even that the flames would devour them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha pipe restaurants, considered themselves and became depressed with inaction.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a little weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head unbelievingly and blocked Kevern's vision.
There was nothing else in the world to see but her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed genuinely worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't that straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he didn't have the soothing charm you needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her deck chair, threw over the console and spilled the wine they had drunk.
elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her arousal, she seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly why I'm drawn to you perversely," she said...
Except I'm not.
He felt sorry for her, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more gruesome after WHAT WAS WHEN their ancestors had been smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickhead?
They'd have shown her a big fist if she wasn't careful!
They first made out - making out was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the unspeakable love ballads from the console - they first make out and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the making itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He rose from the deckchair like an old man.
She also felt leaden, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You barely knew each other.
She watched him move away - just as from a room on the upper floor her companion was watching him do - a man complaining about something he himself had conjured up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just mentioned, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative surveillance body for public sentiment, worked on a short lecture on continuing low- and medium-level violence in precisely the parts of the country in which its reduction, if not abolition, was most likely to be expected, given the funds and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"A lot has already been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human kindness has rarely been felt historically despite the high-questioning church towers between the hedges.
But some qualities turn out to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lower the passion it continues to awaken.
The population cries when listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicates itself with stories of overcome difficulties and claims to firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the former crudeness holds the rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and devious quarrel at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor when he read the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum answered.
Are you a lesbian?
Again Esme relied on her right to privacy and refusal to testify.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a non-prejudiced workplace.
We serve a non-prejudicing society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "behind" and "raw", could be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural strength and vitality.
If you continue riding on what has happened, when it has happened, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away the essential life force of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter century or longer.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you're getting at," Esme Nussbaum answered with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I'm not saying anything but that we haven't been cured as effectively as we pretend to be.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that have been made in the first place when it happened.
This time, however, it is not the others in which we omit our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angelic patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "if you call actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you talk about the fact that they have left out their "crash" and their "mistrust" on "others".
It should not actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that, in understanding the past as in protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "other".
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From being honest with ourselves," Esme ventured to throw, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was back then.
There is no need to say anything more - we agree on that.
And just as no debt has to be assigned, no debt has to be redeemed if such redemption is appropriate and if there is a way to redeem it.
But what does the past serve if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If there's anything I can say about that...
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as described by passers-by, had driven on the footpath in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Officials from the military in Lesotho denied that they had planned a coup to overthrow the government and said that they were going against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country's army had surrounded its seat of office and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting death threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup d'état, but that the military was reacting to the threat of "political fanatics" whose armed forces were imminent.
"What happened this morning was that the defense staff of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that within the police some elements were operating that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a coup.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces have so far shown signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Speaker of the military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Vice Premier Mothetjoya Metsing will take over the leadership during Thabane's absence.
Thabane announced that he believed he had become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There has been great tension in Lesotho since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the clashes in his unified government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, despite other accusations.
Production in the euro-zone at a 13-month low
The increase in output in the euro-zone slowed down to the lowest point of the last 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final markit purchasing manager index of manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went down and factories experienced collapses in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will arrive before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan to deal with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, will be able to provide further information later this week as to whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the eurozone, in line with those undertaken by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46,9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism no longer apply to Germany, as well as to Spain and the Netherlands is also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the August Eurozone purchasing manager index of manufacturing industry is that the sector continues to grow afterwards."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone seem to find life quite difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, in particular large orders.
He said that it would be "always more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The decade of hell of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death during the atrocities in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in abhorrence, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death during the atrocities in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now affecting Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the shot-up school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried to climb back into the shattered school gym in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused Aida looked for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely cured, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need surgery again.
Some shrapnels are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'll think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory is a little weak every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see online the photo of myself climbing back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help to prevent such a thing from happening again.
The boy who fled through the hail of bullets, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she could be dead, he fled and saw a weeping infant on the way, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who put his son in his arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now disbanded News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's getting paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid for a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day, and I hope they'll take me to the school next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
At the time, I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember Damir wanting to eat Borshch and calling all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten any better in those 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like ours.
I think that for many, the war is part of the news they hear when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him sometimes lying on the sofa, turning his face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than I am, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell around me, with body parts lying all around.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling out to him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-flooded face was marked by fear when he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for Beslan's barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before rushing to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, so my little boy stayed alone there for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgi managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always haunting me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day. He said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgi in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in our house in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is turning into something terrible.
"I can't understand how that's possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing at all with such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a few nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1 comes closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friend.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attend a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgi Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniyev was imprisoned at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and then actually felt a little better, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on a laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's secret service academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my medical records, too, and they said it wasn't possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this and, of course, they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I'll go to the memorial celebrations.
I know Georgij won't go.
It has to be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He's been operated on several times, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only increases my pain.
I've lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskaeva, 10
The baby so poignantly carried to safety by a special task force
Saved: Aljona Tskaeva is taken to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
The world held its breath in 2004, when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall in their cruelty.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and with his new wife Svetlana has a little girl that he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, ten years old today, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of having run over girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for running over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having hit a girl on the crossing at Pittenween in East Neuk.
The prosecution claims that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the trial for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you take a lot of shots.
If your camera has a series mode that makes a series of shots with slightly altered exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse as you move away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface if you take shots in a pool, lake or sea.
This allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor lighting conditions.
It is particularly important when working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesia consultant, he dedicated his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the agony of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnoses and diseases are important to doctors, while the treated people are mostly busy with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I've had a hard time picking myself up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently blaming his wife Juliet.
"I prefer everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and without reason disturbed.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast fur, i.e. the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers used to be smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos exposure - contact with the fibrous material, which was once regarded as a "miracle substance" but has since been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Great Britain since the 1960s when the industry voluntarily undertook not to use it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric plumbers, construction workers, carpenters, and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing today the climax of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.
Annual Mesotheliom deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we are now experiencing the deadly effects, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999) is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.
And therefore Mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, the source of this deadly carcinogen has already been identified.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have suffered from mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomer patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends in death.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are going to get sick?"
The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to stop, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been killed.
Most of them don't know they're gonna die like this right now.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned often turn for damages, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma has already spread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was in charge of the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two kids in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most frequently found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still considered by the EU and WHO to be a "great health risk" with possible deaths.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."

Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure to work or in the home were probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
According to him, most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been unknowingly exposed to the material even in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committees were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work has to be spent over several years to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, MEPs will probably meet at the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than at the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places you've been working on and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got some kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was doing surgery late at night.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd make it home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain originated from the breast fur, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Astonished doctors took X-rays of his chest and applied pleural catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
His complaints, however, remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, Abbott's patient with similar symptoms came to his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the rib and breast fur.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Honestly, I wasn't so worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended that he take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
People exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting sick.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who ate in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war hospitals were potentially life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Even schools.
In fact, many people may have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
On websites, the topic of asbestos is now frequently addressed in schools.
Meanwhile, such innocent objects in our homes, such as floor slabs or shed roofs, have as a standard contained asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our property," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch you tear down your garden shed.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is stirred up and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the breast fur, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is ironically now a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others, who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their hospital training.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "the breathing process pushes them to the edge where the skin is.
It is naturally invasive from the very beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is highly controversial.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the breast fur," he says.
You can't get around it with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not appeal very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and consulting office for fellow sufferers.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he introduced himself cheerfully on calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and would probably only prolong his life by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson managed, however, "to make things appear in a somewhat more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be remitted, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and have to wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers are of another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "full-value compensation" because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibers were removed in the affected basement area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
Indeed, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, it is an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance records can be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there were clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to sue for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer available.
The Act has set up a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for all those diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove contact, but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have attributed to them in a normal claim for damages - about £120,000.
Some 300 successful applications to the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma victims, thinks that £350 million was a "very good job" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal between insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time hadn't gone beyond it and mesothelioma sufferers found the companies and could sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths, rapid action was needed every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At this time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
You can see that again and again in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer stains around my chest.
I just turned 50.
It's not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there's no trace of the tumors.
But the process is physically and psychologically very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the Boiler Time attitude works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease that I wouldn't grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and soon we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesotheliomers, such conversations are not pervaded by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as well as Stephen Jay Gould) provides a grim safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This is probably fueling the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that admitting public nominations to the Hong Kong government's elections was "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have the people elect the government chairmanship from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong's citizens have a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in control of the process through a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular protests in Hong Kong have taken place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut off the financial district if Beijing does not allow real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's government headquarters.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that they were planning waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online message, the organisers announced that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that is to take place only if all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and the security measures, including police forces and barricades, were tightened on Sunday in front of the government building.
The unrest is amplified by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the Occupy Central Movement's demonstrations as it endangers the business - Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want to stir fears that Hong Kong will get out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported on democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights, in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the region's history.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the USA is now being transferred to the universities, where Freshmen performances with the private aircraft are offered.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the UK’s first luxury travel service for students today.
The company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1 to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to ride their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
A company spokesman said that there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of £9,000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as being withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NIS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are facing a crisis of cost of living, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the rapidly rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the dormitory.
Feminists Criticize Race Question and Police Behavior According to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants lifted their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Midwest increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that white women's responses revolved 100% around the race.
Compared with the answers of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts to Ferguson of a White Woman" and "Feminism is not only about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think you can find many people in feminism who talk about white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the events.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson exposed problems to which black American women are exposed every day, but which are not regarded as "women's issues" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the themes cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattry, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattry.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattry, the split between white and black women came at the point when white women campaigners for women's voting rights, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for voting rights could only be successful for one group at a time: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to campaign for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattry.
When you remember things like that, you realize with power why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the times when white feminists played "fangs" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?" Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation, who built up their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race, which are clearly different in public polls - will lead to changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on the racial theme in America are stunned.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson are in contrast to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's south-west border this year, the issue of immigration reform also comes to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilises women for immigration reform, said that for a re-examination of the subject as an essential issue for women, she would only have to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women accompanying them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in women's organizations," she said.
"pig house" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - to which also a pig belonged, that his head had nested on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was accidentally released and has been removed," said a spokesperson for the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house caused interest in social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lotto player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newsstand in Harvey drew the jackpot for the second time in five years in the draw of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the profit provides conversation material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had won the $7.5 million mega win just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the winning allowed them the possibility of a world tour and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators stood ankle-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were completely inspired by the historic spectacle.
There was a colorful dance of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force from the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and successively sent his men into the ring for heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
At first the "Provocators" were in turn with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with breast shield, short sword and lance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm guard.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who with throwing net, dreizack and dagger against the "secutor" and after a short fight pushed the boy to the ground.
As the swords crept metallically against each other, the shields crept and the lances flew surreptitiously through the arena that could become a fear and anxiety around the health of gladiators.
But the impressive "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era tangible," said Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organiser "Friends of the Roman Canal", explaining the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became for one day an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired during Roman Day, for example "Aqueduct marble" from the eleven-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Roman canal bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once and now faced the supply of water and energy, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time today."
This is also confirmed by Ralph Heiliger, a graduate surveyor from the "Engineering TeamZwei" in Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Also impressive are the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the clay footsteps before they were burned.
In 2011, the Land Monuments Department of Rhineland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord industrial park in Rheinbach.
They found enclosure walls of an economic building with a tarpaulin for drying grain and malting.
The building probably belonged to a villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a series of finds from these excavations in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the Germanic invasion in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
With her, the children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's Mühlespiel, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax tablets, just like the Roman students once did.
At the booth of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, make glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and use a heavy wheat mill made of stone at the stand of the natural center Eifel Nettersheim to grind the flour for a flat bread or a cereal.
With the original replica of the Roman travel car drawn by two cold-blooded people, visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive booth of the Städtische Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a week of Romans from 13th to 21st September, the community of Wachtberg will also contribute to the year 2014 proclaimed throughout Rhineland, which is supposed to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Heimat- und Geschichtsvereinen as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the amateur play circle Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and reminiscent of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will tell about his work on the zugigen Wachtberg, introduce plants as living monuments from the Roman era and offer a funny lesson on international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Römerwoche the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made experienceable again.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus a small presentation will remind you of the discovery of the Berkumer Matron shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic Harms West Africa’s Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is giving the economy of West Africa a severe blow.
The crop rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has severely added to the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola come onto the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, and here alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have died, and thousands more have died.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies are suspending their operations all over the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also react: few merchants leave their homes to get supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
The farmers dare not leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
This is why the population gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, stocks of staple foods such as rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies is threatened with image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon from the French think tank Iris.
The decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
Investors may have the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the strained state budgets of the states
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
Moody's rating agency fears that its budgets will be heavily strained by high spending on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger delta is not affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also decline significantly.
Protecters celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald the preparations for the 50-year foundation festival from 12th to 14th September run in full swing.
A big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned on Friday, September 12th.
Saturday is at 6 p.m. the big Böller shooting.
Afterwards the evening of the mood with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam" is in the big festival tent.
Brass band ensures the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the large procession at 2 pm.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of federal and Gauschießen.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festive ladies with their dirndln.
Festkapelle is the brass band Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker took over the patronage.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment by means of exercise in room and small caliber shooting".
The Nazi regime had caused the club to dissolve in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who founded the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau on 30 April in the Gasthaus Lukas.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as champion shooters through a difficult beginning time, in which it was primarily about finding a club club and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965 the shooting club started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sport shooters, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records were set every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was first reached in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
Since the club club "Leininger" has no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988, Pastor Strasser granted the church blessing for the new shooting rooms.
One of the great highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44th Gauschießen, connected with the solemn consecration of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Böller group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A big challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böllertreffen 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work, the members of the association modernized the rooms and shooting range in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought up to date the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
The sporting achievements of the shooting club can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently taking part in the round competitions: six air-gun teams, an air-gun team, a sports pistol KK1, a youth team and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the district league 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as Bockenstechen, carnival and royal ball, club trip and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the feasts in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers accident on return to the racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst in lap 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-strong team was disappointed, but now focuses on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better stake and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond, hoping we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier during the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver in an ash track race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the road to confront Stewart during a race.
The authorities announced on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart will have to expect an indictment.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had already entered the first 10 shortly after and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a reboot in lap 122, Buschs got
Car number 18 out of control after the exit from turn 2 and collided with Stewart, both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st.
Young Dancers Wanted
Simply try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to join forces.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups on TV Jahn are also involved in all-day classes at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays some groups have decimated strongly.
Now we are increasingly looking for new talents for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups by Lisa Neitzel, formerly a dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to fifteen-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can take a look into the training session on Thursdays between 5 pm and 6 pm or on Fridays between 5 pm and 6.30 pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," the trainer explains.
After that, different choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore, classical music, sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, sociability is not too short either.
"We also go to dinner, watch dance films and we have stayed in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don't like jazz dancing, you can also take a look at one of the other TV Jahn offers.
Children and young people can always take part in classes in the fields of children's dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop on Wednesdays.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you want discofox, slow waltz, Viennese waltz, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango, you can stop by and join in.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for one month and calling for a return to the former 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Council (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continue, the Director-General for the implementation of sanctions, Rosen Zhelyazkov, informed the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union association of the Ministry of Interior employees.
Ukrainian army has abandoned airport of Luhansk
In eastern Ukraine pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy battles, in which allegedly also Russian tank battalions were involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk.
At the same time, the army announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership, without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have once again shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Some 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in combats in the Donetsk region, the insurgents informed Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Sea of Azov.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been bombarded on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had taken control of several villages in the Donetsk area.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
Today, the Ukraine Contact Group is meeting in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also take part.
In the run-up, all the actors used their appearances to publicise their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia as a result of the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
However, NATO chief accused Russia of "a glaring breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side show "that they regard us as opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced his intention to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision by the European Union was still awaited as to whether to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also disrupt the gas supply to Europe.
Europe draws about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks Password: Toll will come "all right"
Now the Chancellor is firmly committed to this.
But it is not a licence for all complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the passenger car toll have increasingly enraged the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, after persistent resistance from her CDU, has spoken a bold word for the introduction of a passenger car toll.
"To put it quite clearly, it is in the coalition agreement and it will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU top committees in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not decide on a detailed model for the time being.
In the black-red government program are called "certain parameters".
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) had "made a proposal, and this is now being worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also contributed constructively to the discussions for a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for infrastructure investments, including broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house tested its own concept to remunerate highway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the cabinet.
CDU Federal Vice-President Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that it would be able to use all the district and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian chairman of the CDU.
In this respect, it was an important signal that Seehofer had now announced that it would discuss the subject again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU state associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is concerns that tolls affect local border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism from the CDU.
The Left regards the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The minister fails with the toll." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is due to start in 2016.
According to the coalition agreement, however, domestic car owners must not be subjected to additional burdens.
Therefore, they are to receive a full compensation for the toll via the motor vehicle tax.
However, according to EU law, the model must not penalise foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought, as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years, that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years left to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe gait and curved toes.
Sick people also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would be in a wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same thing as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything took longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with the other children and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 years, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, when her doctor left the room, she saw her medical record and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair when I was 18 and die when I was 25, and in between I was slowly losing all my skills.
I did all this alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, or you'd be in a wheelchair right now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness month to raise awareness of this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a firecracker since the closure of the former military training ground
For almost ten years now, the former military training ground in Münsingen has not been shot.
Nevertheless, every month deadly ammunition still appears at the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the ground.
A deafening bang echoes at the blasts over the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since then, the 6500-hectare area has been at the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated paths.
Tax burden on businessmen in Washington increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion to public and local entities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the 2012 income of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden on companies rose by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third year of growth in a row after several years of declining communications in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more strongly than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenues from companies at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the real estate values of the companies, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes of 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these gains came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to apply to the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in increasing government and local tax revenues as real estate taxes amount to just over a fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland, for example, is forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes from state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland accounted for $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not increase evenly in all three locations.
The rate of increase in the District was 4.3 per cent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported below average tax revenues of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes (6 per cent) in all three branches of government (all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
Maryland's corporate tax rate is 8.25 percent and the district is relatively high 9,975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that lower state and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and overall there is a better tax climate than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not studied.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, so they pay more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure under which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significant faster growth rate than total corporate taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in general multi-force tax revenues for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could lag behind if the Federal Government's spending cuts affect the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes for a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the official in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said Li Yiwei, vice party secretary of the South China metropolis, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the conversation, the Chinese Communist Party's official repeatedly returned to this concern of the twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as the Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German delegation of politicians, told the host that he would look around in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already exudes Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the functionary from Guangzhou met with shepherd's gümbel - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business
A second wish of Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party leader Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business between our two cities continues to grow."
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, the capital of which is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in the foreground in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," said Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese vice minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Well-maintained partnership
The lewd vice party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this position.
He came into office only this year, after his predecessor had been removed from office for allegations of corruption.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the Party and administration, which is strongly enforced by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new senior politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen twinnings.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese Association was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic power.
Next year she wants to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "squeezing the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City; however, her daughter was now hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian would recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said today in a message.
We all keep our fingers crossed.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest in a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately sedated and observed them until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
More stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are now available on the market.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1st, allowing the buyer to identify central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
New cars are subject to stricter nitrogen oxide values in the "Euro 6" category of pollutants.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffold builders: They receive a uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros nationwide.
Amazon Buys Twitch for $1.04 Billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US$).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was for a cool billion decided thing, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their feats in games, a "YouTube for live games," said an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better-knowers give the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken up a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company buying a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't come about, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon did.
All we know right now is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to exercise rather than watch, it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes watching others play instead of taking control of themselves.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something completely different, watching a weirdo get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there isn't a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men recruited as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallowing - as spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the Burggartenfest on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltwedel l light and fun.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula from two Spanish words.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already evident on early Saturdays, when the first visitors went to open air.
The organizers had promised a feast for all generations.
And that's what they did.
Around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese it had made itself Salzwedeler, but also guests from the closer and further surroundings cozy.
They followed the first live performances, flipped with their feet in time, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced.
And this across the generations.
While some of them lumbled on blankets on the extra-carred white sand at the beach bar, others lavered on a quarter of wine in the vinothek, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But also in children's make-up the volunteers had to do their hands full in the truest sense of the word, in order to become master of the urge and to conjure imaginative creations into the small faces.
The bigger ones used the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel hosted.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he spoke down on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
However, the attractiveness of the festival did not detract from this.
"More people came than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success all along the line."
Therefore, there is nothing to prevent a repetition of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still has to be worked on, Sem made clear to the popular voice in a first report on Sunday.
He described it as annoying that the admission had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little power.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the site.
The response was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedel co-organiser spoke of about 1200 visitors who were strolling around the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox therefore broke off their appearance unnerved.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably sound.
The planned shisha lounges could not be built, because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tire breakdown.
"But next year they will be there," said the organiser.
The premiere of the Amula open air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes, which are still forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated at the second edition.
In the social network Facebook, too, the organizers have to take criticism.
"Sorry, but you just expected more for twelve euros," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you've taken over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I think it's very good that some people not only talk stupidly, but also really try to get something on their feet.
Hut off!", writes Stephanie Jenß to the amula.
Now the organisers have one year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-to-use component is waiting to be inserted into the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom with a diameter of 47.5 meters will be slightly smaller than the old one.
But the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new case is to replace the caps
The upper quarter of the old hull is cut off and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is put on.
As far as the weather is concerned, the action is scheduled to take place at the beginning of this week.
Participants at the Ice Bucket Challenge Dislocated Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge went off painfully.
A woman was hospitalized after screaming so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and as I did, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but I couldn't, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw it too and almost panted out with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to re-establish the jaw after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon pull together again?
Most recently there was always a conflict between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the executive boards are thinking about a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
Just a year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
Up to now, the viewpoints on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshaus castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to be very different.
The two camps are now moving towards each other: discussions on a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down once," says Sjöberg.
He felt that all the members of both clubs would be able to pull together again in the future.
Thus, visible successes can be seen more quickly.
While the castle friends had in mind the sudden death of Richard Dimbath until the last reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the castle club around Sjöberg the "opening and experiencing" of the site is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been in front of the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the club activities rest out of respect." This "thinking phase" was necessary in order to "think how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also create a current mood within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to "but very much like to continue working on the project".
The different points of view regarding reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
They were a tourist magnet due to the high participation of the population as well as voluntary helpers from all over the world.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to advance the project." A "all-time feature" could be created for the rafter city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein might move a little bit on this point.
Their goal of documenting history first is "important and good".
That's what you could see.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the almost second-semester student Matt Schroeder thought up a clever spar idea.
He invented a loan system for higher-semester students' books and offered nominal compensation to delay the return sale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management announced that students spend more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and study materials on average, but that there are various cost-reduction options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
The rental of textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly lower price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college bookstores last spring semester, said Neebo's Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-time one for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books online cost only a third of the price they are available for at the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind the notes of other or normal signs of usage, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was newly sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors if previous issues were admissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you don't want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for about $20 for a semester.
Find out about the terms of the business where you rent, including the penalty fees that may apply for writing notes, underlinings or signs of usage.
Pay attention to tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about 61 $.
Bracey says that students often find the best offers in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I'm sure you'll look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online you should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" did not become a cashier
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million dollar budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars of its 70 million dollar budget.
The Cameron Diaz-tailored film "Sex Tape" played only $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's movies like "Drachenzämmen leicht gefacht 2" also disappoint in the revenue.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason for the children's films.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "dragon tames made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
For films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film launch, which was shown on at least 2000 screens between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinemagoers and film critics and indicate that this year's hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming Jungle Book film, told Hollywood Reporter, "I think times are changing."
We have to accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated sales of 1.2 billion dollars of streaming content, almost twice as much as last year's sales of 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming comics and predicted a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclic" and said to Hollywood reporters: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office at all, and no one will worry about business anymore."
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis district class was removed to streamline the league classification, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the programme.
The consequence: Those who have not ascended have descended.
Thus Göttingen's highest-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga-Relegation avoided the descent, but in the coming season plays only fifth-class.
Torpedo's ladies remain fourth-class, despite their grandiose march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve are competing in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttingen clubs.
==References====External links==*Official website*Official website*Official website
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new District Oberliga South.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC compete.
In the district league play as regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of the TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district league of the ladies starts at least in Sollstärke.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each
SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district league squad of the SCW boys - there still Torpedo II starts - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV enter the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West Staffel are the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the East Staffel.
The Women's Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no longer any women's teams at the county level.
Noting that none of the six 2nd district classes achieves target strength, the innovative and busy district board will have to think about this.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend there were protests from opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us this weekend and talking to demonstrators who have travelled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO young bushwalkers were brought to safety with the winch after being trapped in the Blue Mountains in NSW during the night.
THE 16 - year - old girl and the 19 - year - old man left for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govets Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search party from local police and emergency services set out and the couple was found at about 11 p.m. near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and had opened his head.
Rescue personnel stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were sent to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable state with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
The approximately 1000 demonstrators had been pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said information minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The broadcaster had re-recorded the broadcast after more than half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators demand the resignation of the head of government to whom they accuse election fraud.
The police announced that around one kilometre from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence there had been clashes with security forces on Monday by some 3000 demonstrators.
According to the hospital, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured on the weekend when demonstrators tried to get to Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without using force" on Sunday evening after a meeting in the Army headquarters.
The announcement also stated: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has fueled concern about military intervention, which has been pushing more frequently in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since the Independence Day on August 14th.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed similar sentiments.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election last May by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and proclaim new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had initially peacefully endured before the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to enter Sharif's residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer finished third in the table after the second victory of the season.
With the 2-0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday has come to an end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the end of the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and goal scorer Steffen Hofmann, who took third place with green and white.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second win of the season and is taking part in the international match break with a successful experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory in the 14th minute with his magnificent leadership volley from the Sixteenereck.
"I thought I was going through all Thursday's frustrations and snuck it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on November 13, 2010, this was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid youth," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pelvis blessur by Mario Pavelic Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this position mirrorwise.
He has earned the goal, he has already done some assists this year," praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2:0 by Hofmann after about an hour, which finally brought the decision.
For before that the guests could have also written.
"Thank God we have had some luck today," said Schrammel, who alluded to the cracking-up of performance and results over the past few weeks: "The results did not vote, but the playing was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that they had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season".
The first three points since 26 July therefore proved that the team structure was intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
For him no less gratifying: "That we finally played too zero again".
A lot of work during the inter-country break Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures have to be lamented, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their debuts make the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget this," said Barisic, who has lost in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The inter-country break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and add a bit to the physical range", explained Barisic, who has five U21 selection actors in his ranks.
One who seems to be in a special position is Captain Hofmann.
He rips himself apart for the team, goes over pain.
In this difficult phase he showed that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann not only gave the game Rapids the structure, but also scored the second goal before his 68th minute change.
For the 33-year-old who made his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Mayn't believe that everything is good now" "We have certainly had a bit of luck, but at some point the luck has to come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
Of course, he called for concentrated further work: "You can't always see it black and white.
We have not played as badly in the last few weeks as this has been shown.
Nor can we believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help a lot right now.
They stick to me in certain phases," Hofmann said.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team.
He regretted the quick match "from the category Zaubertor", as well as the regular goal of profit in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly denied by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards goal in some phases.
We've had too few degrees.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started equally badly, but then we found it and even made a goal.
By and large, there would have been more in it.

We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the county, the illustrated specimen is the "Geißruhe" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It goes past Koppeln, basalt stone heaps and basalt stone seas.
A bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vitally the natural monument looks, it towers over the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds with a circumference of over eight meters of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what relationship it has with the Geißruhe.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Until about 80 years ago, the goat herders were said to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the arduously grubbed and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree the animal keepers exhausted by the ascent are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows, goat herds actually graze again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When entering the stone collections, however, caution should be exercised, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular location for cross otters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is a bit hidden.
Further paths are signposted, which climb up towards Hochrhön and invite to an extended hike.
Where's the Wasserburg?
However, a water castle, which is sought for in our next task, is rarely to be found in the height.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district to which the building counterfei could fit.
Where is our piece of Rhöner Glück?

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the European Union, Matteo Renzi, won the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy at last week's EU Special Summit against strong conservative resistance.She will succeed the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica puts it, the appointment of his Mogherini, who is also a favourite in the government team, as a strengthening of the position of the social democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the left party base, which is constantly rising against him, because Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit in a more moderate way.
With respect to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome, was to achieve a political balance.
The EU's chief diplomat will also be the deputy to Commission President Juncker.
The pending approval of the EU Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the Mogherini, who has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and known for her ambition, will be able to cope with the "estandard challenges".
She is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which in 2008 merged with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita to form today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the 2001 election to the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she became a member of the party's high politics, working in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his Foreign Minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's more than 40 percent vote in the EU elections in May, then, as is noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The preliminaries in Brussels that the new EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner has too little diplomatic experience, so it lacks substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, in particular by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherinis are suspiciously pursuing realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine and defamed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to Southern Europe by bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to secure Italy's energy.
After Renzi took up his office as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photographs they showed with Putin at the Shake Hands were taken in Brussels with indignation, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milan Economic Summit in October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed a different training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will be employed in four training occupations: electronics (three apprentices), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All apprentices come from Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Büchel from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years as well as the instructors drive to a team training event in Oberammergau, where a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the agenda.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval by the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As a pacifying gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite strong demands for a relaxation of Emmanuel Macron's regime, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his co-socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, threw sand into the box, in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist parliamentarians and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the constant trench struggles of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive the fall or winter either," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's call for parliament to be dissolved and said that she was confident that she would be victorious in early elections and that she was ready for government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead in the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment rates.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen further.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise provider, is leading advanced negotiations to acquire Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and to its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent interest in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo refused a comment.
Located in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean Sea, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises filed an IPO with the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise company owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino conglomerate under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed on the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have a combined 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking group waved the Chinese flag nearby.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to have peking-like members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and prompted pro-democracy activists to fulfill their threat and paralyze Hong Kong's financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that the calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which set out China’s predominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, during which hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li's survey is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The vice-chairman of the Standing Committee's Legal Commission, Zhang Rongshun, as well as the vice-director of Hong Kong's and Macau's State Council, Feng Wei, should be interviewed during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in front of the leadership office in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain did not provide for any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands Kiev to start "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
According to Russian media reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and start negotiations on the "state" of the apostate region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the start of the riots five months ago: to help the separatists take territories and pressure the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region to become de facto independent for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel Kanal One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently described the occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "Neurrussia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups attack civilian communities in the separatist-held areas, are hoping for early peace talks "caught in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start detailed discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman's clarification to correct Putin's "misinterpretation" underscored Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and pre-conflict surveys showed a broad majority for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy raised by Russian diplomats in international fora would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus de facto giving the Kremlin control over an area connecting Russia's territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, speaking at the inauguration ceremony on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider additions to the Constitution, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose weapons and incitement are accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level followed after another advance by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoasovsk, which according to fears of Ukrainian security officials is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have begun to secure Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of a point where there is no turning back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Reports in Kiev on Saturday.
On Sunday, the first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk, were exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, informed Lysenko.
Nude photo scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger about hackers who probably stole nude pictures of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a who is who of the A-promises from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal around celebrities on the Internet.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "the tributes of Panem" and superstars, among them the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
The Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne allegedly also published private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Most noble, who had engaged Grecko last month, said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly said that the hack was "harmful" and that those affected felt "harmed".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies up without in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked pictures yesterday.
A representative Lawrence' said to TMZ, "It is a vile violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Having hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing other than selling fenced goods."
From a purely legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, jogger and hiker took part in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg yesterday and supported the association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was for one ordeal, was for the other a light training.
But one thing everyone agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus drove his bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good cause.
He can easily put away the small muscle sore, especially since his participation in the 8th cycle on the Großer Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for children with cancer" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought him a valuable insight.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - great!"
Little break on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Upper Ursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants tortured themselves yesterday in the early dew to the mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to cross the 11 km long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Diessner, for example.
The green politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - who appeared completely in red made a little bit of understatement at the start ("A lot of professionals, there is arrival the finish!"), but then on the mountain proved to be half a professional and went through the finish after 45 minutes without breathlessness.
He also drove through the track in a slip, as did Nina Kuhn, press officer of the city of Oberursel, who had set off together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we would like to be there - we would have done an exit today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning, in order to jump back to the height.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9 o'clock in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, and then to roll home with fun.
I had fun with Fritten-Toni, too.
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg simply belong to it.
He had planned 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo race bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious road cyclist".
He must be, because he was on the road with the "Fixie-Rad", which are also racing bikes, but without circuit...
The 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fox Dance up to the summit proved that it was easy to climb up even without a bike, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights on a cord behind him.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with all-wheel-bully and quad, ensured safety, said: "I know the one from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself". So the man is in a way his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent to the track in the morning in groups.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that he will be able to block the route up to the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
