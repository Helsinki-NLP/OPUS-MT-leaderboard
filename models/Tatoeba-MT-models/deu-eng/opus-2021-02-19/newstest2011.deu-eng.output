What should she do, the Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old and new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city council.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has "knocked" members of the new council from the ČSSD a little bit as they dominate the notorious slang, which has become naturalized in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary introduced by Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite in the past era is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils showed something in the dark with regard to these new terms.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm rather a newcomer to Prague's politics," responded Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, to the test of the "Paten vocabulary".
But also the Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "golf hole".
"This is the only expression of those you're presenting to me here, which I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of Slang."
From the vocabulary published by the Tageblatt Aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the election congress of the ODS, the editors picked out six terms, especially those which are notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "cracking animals", "rattling the capital" and "bleaching".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, while the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the discussion first, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the democrats talk to each other, I don't judge about them."
"For me, it is important to understand how we understand ourselves in the context of our programmes," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not realize in the above-mentioned headline that the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, is mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed during the test was "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to the security: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "golf hole" is then correctly deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillor for environmental issues Lukáš Plachý as tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague restaurant", Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he affirms that he has drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that he has this vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there really does not seem to be a similar naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called "Hulda" by his party members salopp.
"At school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is friendly to the party comrades the "Opa" or less friendly of the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections through machinations in the party sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
Thus, nicknames are the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in internal party language.
Hulínský allegedly does not like it when it is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz also registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Gummistick Rights" is allegedly related to Petr Hulínský's acquisition of the title Doctor juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and published a brochure
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong more to the older generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared this, as they help with their work and give birth to children," a nun describes the situation that takes care of more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities in a special home in the capital of Burkina Faso.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he published a brochure to stop the "witch tracking".
But there's a catch to this.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "the standard" pointed to the dilemma of written education.
But to be accused of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured petroleum on her and simply lit her.
This incident was also reported to the BBC server.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter was just a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointing.
After the group tried to "exorate" "an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports the people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Furnitures of human souls are a danger in the past as they are today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the President of the Gambia has thoroughly mixed the president himself.
"President Yahya Jammeh ignited a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, because they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To this end, he called for the help of Shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, forcibly abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud of plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the imprisoned people did not survive their stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older subordinated man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a portfolio with three new leases to three dwellings: for his own and the dwellings of his daughters and his son, who is now serving a prison sentence.
All three have just been increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is to pay 4100 kroner next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there's not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal oven," he says, angry with his finger, on the son's new lease, to which he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I have signed," he explains half indignant and half resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental terms as "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, when they intend to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man's just waving.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a major "deregulatory laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is in front of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay a market-oriented rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Hav.ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o'clock in the morning this Tuesday is full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device.
"Rent 2011", a special touch field lights up on the touchscreen.
Briefly typed and already the device spits out a license plate.
Hardly have we deciphered the number "157" and already it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room obviously does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the Kuverts with the new leases will float into the mailboxes of most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty proposes to them in the letters an increase in rent of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for the new rentals in the client center has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, that's just the beginning," the ladies answer after a moment of hesitation behind the counter, when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' homes are a hot topic.
Before the elections, the vice-president of the parliament Lubomír Zaorálek from Ostrava had taken up this issue quite loudly from the ČSSD, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They couldn't even change WC glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning airs.
Until now, according to the employees, pensioners in particular are standing at the counter to see if they really receive the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who sign the new lease until 15 December, will also benefit from a half-reduced February rent.
Until now, however, "deregulation switch" is anything but overloaded by requests.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rents in 2011 were here because of," the clerks estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites and wall panels, where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not to be a threat, but to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on his websites.
"No one is going to trial here," says one of the RPG Byty employees, and a man on the street outside the client center at least partially agrees with her.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I get the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee gets insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them not to sign through the media, so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic for New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty and - in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase is precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the insurgent tenants.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the housing from 2005 to 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Hav
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"This always means a maximum of CZK 7,50 per square metre per month", can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only at 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio does the rent increase by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of CZK 19,66 per square meter," RPG argues.
At 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive rents skyrocketing, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes a further obligation: All revenues from the rental increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - into new windows and into thermal insulation.
But - above all, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-play area on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design staff since last year.
Arch.Design, the design and architecture firm from whose studios a whole series of renowned Brno buildings originate, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is interested in the project managers returning to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the opportunity to work shorter, Kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
The civil engineers have so much easier to reconcile their demanding profession and child care.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and, with the support of management, they were able to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The company's mini-kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from the European Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies of CZK 2.8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and qualified personnel and operations were provided for a period of 2 years.
After 2 years of funding, Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the Minikindergarten for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating actively assisting in the implementation of the application.
The children are cared for by fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day changes over several children.
The kindergarten is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the supporting programme of pre-school education.
Not only do the children play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, while also learning English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress is eliminated when the children are picked up late from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also emerging here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn up fish mouths.
This is Casa Batlló by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants the house with its organic forms got the nickname "Knobenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the scales-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
It is only when you take a closer look that you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the whole façade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination enhances the shine of the colours.
The same sweeping lines and entwined forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-like shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and strips.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end he agreed with Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Antoni Gaudí did not design the Casa Batlló apartment house alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on its drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner arose and the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other painters and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in Park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was nicknamed "Knobenhaus" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "gawning house".
It is also said that the sword of Saint George, the patron of Catalonia, is depicted at the top of the building.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system for the house, which was unique at the time, with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
It's a bit bizarre, her 45-degree inclination already seems.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations at the time and did not let himself be deceived by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the relevant building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so horrified by the result that they demanded remedy two years later when it was completed.
Among other things, the councillors also stumbled upon the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no more changes, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the city's request to do so, Josep Batlló submitted an application for the permit to rent the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
By the basic elements of the conversion all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked on a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably, without having to renounce a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new façade, the house received a rather unusual roof and two more floors.
Gaudí's play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is disguised and the courtyards is impressive.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
In doing so, he simply used the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by everyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is open to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was discovered that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, yes, they were extended to other common rooms and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard handle, it amounts to 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the housemates and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the lying area - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In the selection many things play a role - the weight, the size, the health condition and last but not least also the sex of the sleeper.
Just as important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend home where there is no regular heating, latex mattresses are not well suited as they take much longer to become "warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough vents in the core and are also lying on a solid plate, moisture incites: it is therefore not impossible that mould forms under them.
In the election, of course, it also plays a role in what you are used to.
Anyone who has been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Well, all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their worn shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"Among other things, I recommend these to diabetic people who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can not receive the "information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why I bought many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer among others the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it literally nestles on the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, in the night one does not roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound burn).
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should still add the length of the soles to your body height, i.e. approx.21 to 34 cm.
A man like a woman with a height of 180 cm needs a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm lying width available, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal width of the bed: "If you are lying on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholstery and interior decorators, who has been dedicated for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and who also presents this topic to technical schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, there is nothing else but to mount the grates at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be removed from the mould layer and the fine cushion.
"You can't feel the feathers with your hand or when you sit down," Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and underlay such as co-grown Siamese twins have nothing to do in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be aired and the cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged sieve).
This is also why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even a lifetime guarantee for mattresses.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, nevertheless it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which one can easily peel off and wash.
Even though today mattress covers are usually made with all-round zippers, so that you get two halves after opening (especially important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially carried out alone, often seems like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get it out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (unless there are any) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket spring core and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a backing.
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for non-adjustable slats with 14 to 18 spring strips (lamellas) (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), always pay for rusts with a larger number of slats, i.e. 28 and more spring strips, with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility to regulate the slat hardness.
No mattresses with spring skeleton belong to adjustable lamella rusts, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special attachment of the spring rails, which allows the spring rails to be pressed in or even angled in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink selectively.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
Point-elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or rusts with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are intended for the most demanding customers.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow to the right mattress and correct rust, most of the benefits will be lost.
Here too a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow seems ideal, as the Scandinavians like it, for example.
In the lateral position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
The new magic word "bio" is also used for mattresses.
Instead of crude oil, more and more natural oils are used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example castor oil and soybean oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"In mattresses, organic means their core is made of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Va
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scents while sleeping.
Here, too, you make a difference between man and woman.
While in men a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used, so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets warm while sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffnesses (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heel are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have to rap 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and rust is not so easy.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with visco foam memory for CZK 11,990.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, it solidifies in a cool environment.
Thus, it adapts perfectly to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to facilitate the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers, for example, use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear for their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for the search for cars, can locate people just as well, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently when nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared without a trace.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it should not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have been frightened by the disappearance of Anička, so they are looking for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of compromising their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there can be abuse of such devices in individual cases, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without knowing about it, but we have not had such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
"In the beginning, the mobile phones already raised great expectations among parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution will actually help in the event of an attack.
"In planned kidnappings, the kidnapper virtually always checks whether the child has any electronics with him that could be used to locate it."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to find wider use, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," the psychologist says.
She admits, however, that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted so that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"With more expensive devices even a tilt meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one only needs to install a special software.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that they are either matchbox-sized devices similar to trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There's always a danger of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin from Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital clocks are being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or tracking device.
"Or he only notices after a certain time what gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - towards wristbands or trailers, the same technology is always used, as in vehicle tracking.
Thus, the combination of positioning function using the GPS system (just like the GPS in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses that you could wrap all over the Czech Republic but only hold you for two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of ignition cords, to be ignited with explosives.
The previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the stock company STV Group, a. s. for läppische 40 million crowns.
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this enormous amount of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume 60 kilometers of ignition cord annually.
According to research by military pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES referred to, this statement indicates that the entire army would have to undergo extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from generals and officers of the Army Command to secretaries and cleaning women.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition cords be partially justified.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these armies would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts is still valid, that to train every new professional soldier two meters of ignition cord completely sufficient, then the army has created a calming supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
In the process, soldiers from the Rapid Operations Brigade recently complained to Defence Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises of the missing funds were severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't understand why they buy so many fuses from us."
But that is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need them to do."
"For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we as a dealer would like to approach as much as possible", says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, explains the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignition cord by this means that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only speaks of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians only of two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are also possible," admits one of them, but he wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
At the end of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the volume discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," spokesman Pejšek, informing us of the position of buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of ignition cords by police pyrotechnicians who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet fraternal army has for a few years now barely exceeded 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only such quantities of these ammunition, which they can consume before the end of the service life.
Because of the safety of pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore reliable ignition belts is also kept open.
The Ministry of Defence has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who approached MF DNES, in a few years the Czech armed forces are expecting the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old fuses, which they have bought so "favorably" today.
To this day, I have enjoyed the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition.
Lukáš Pytloun won the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition and helped him sell his hotel's franchise.
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec was the winner of the last year of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there was no good accommodation in Liberec at reasonable prices.
From the savings from his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a sixth-semester college student at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then he has been able to open four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity.
The most comfortable of them until recently was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
Another first-class hotel was added this year.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one last year.
"Great share in this license sale to operate hotels had just won the competition "Entrepreneurs of the Year", adds Mr. Pytloun acknowledgingly.
The victory has brought him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, they often even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that was really good," he remembers.
I really recommend to all those who want to do something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win, either, any visualization is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have happened at all.
"With some people I met thanks to the competition, I maintain regular business relationships until today."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success also reflects a little on each of his employees.
And there he has to the seventy.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that is generally acknowledged."
I really don't see this as a personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name has only moved a little to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year when we had it in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first place of the competition Vodafone Company of the Year in the past year was accepted by Karel
At the time, the jury praised the efforts with which he stomped a company out of the ground from small tool making in Česká Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation has not only encouraged myself, but also encouraged all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered a small workshop for rent to his father Karel Rský as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists, he did not hesitate long, left his career in the company in which he was employed until then, and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few of his father's comrades.
A short time later, they began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success in the mentioned competition and its medialization did it come into the consciousness of the non-specialist public.
"Not only did our customers notice the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country in attaching greater value," says Karel
The past year, however, was not only about victory euphoria at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of toolmaking products.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less the citizens, but above all companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't escape this situation either."
"Revenues declined by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and even resort to redundancies," says Karel
A viable company may also need to take such unpopular measures.
However, it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in the black numbers, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to make cuts - in terms of investment in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training center, strengthened our presentation at international fairs and obtained major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a calmer atmosphere", says Karel
An opinion poll that cleans up with nonsense
The opinion poll on the "Absurdity of the Year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some senseless regulations have already managed to get out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" became the duty to create documents on authorities that are available online.
For example, more than a third of not quite four thousand voice-giving entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have called it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"In future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register for checks on social security payers," said ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraňová.
The purpose of the survey "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to remove the absurd ones.
This is for the fourth time this year part of an entrepreneur competition, which is organized by the tsch. Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and enjoys increasing popularity in the public.
When the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
"As for the number of income tax forms, for example, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of corporate conditions, with an eight-ranking position worse than in the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was first proclaimed in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of September.
The website www.firmaroku.cz is used to register. After that, the organiser of the competition selects seven candidates for the "Antipreis" and lets the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, or more precisely 105, senseless regulations and orders have already been notified for this year's opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, are regulations that maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to prepare every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November on Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a happening, in which also personalities of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, participated in the highlight of the competition.
"Where the state throws a stick between the entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic upturn, so my aim is to remove at least thirty paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to get senseless arrangements out of the world are effective.
In 2007, people were most disturbed by the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to report three days in advance the intention to go to an exhibition or fair with an exhibition stand to the trade office at the location of their permanent establishment.
This obligation was abolished by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation, which in 2007 received the second largest number of votes - the obligation to report to the employment office missions of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "green card".
And - all good things are three:
On the absurdity of the year 2009, the decree was chosen, which ordered physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the speech room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to refrigerate fell away.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair undertakings.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, who is the promoter and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year, companies have registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is highly inspirational and offers enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject matter of their activity, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This concerns, for example, people who have been hacked, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for gehandicapte children for seventeen years.
A paper mill from Poděbrady also provides exemplary care for its disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which it was awarded the title "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia Region"; in the competition Vodafone Company of the Year, it took third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a fluid working time reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, without any relative wage reduction.
During the award ceremony, the jury also honored the fact that the company mainly purchases from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment," explains their managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, on the other hand, is concerned with the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, it also promotes home work among its employees and uses Cartering services offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the "People in Need" foundation, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses, to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with food, work, qualification and holiday contributions," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch in Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the category Responsible company of the year all district finalists of the contest Vodafon company of the year were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the registration and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Wrong or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of police in a public tender
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was handcuffed by the detectives.
The latter allegedly had tried to manipulate a currently occurring public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition fell to a concrete interested party.
Luboš G. is said to have paid half a million.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person for the crime of fraudulent conduct in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner Procuratorate of the newspaper "Právo", who could not provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about this in view of the scant official information.
The spokesman for the land fund Lubomír Černá referred to the question raised by Právo in this regard that the police had actually made arrests at the Pilsner branch of the land fund, and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she concretized.
According to Ms Černá, public competition had the correct term "call for bids for land transfer rights under the Land Law" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"As part of the invitation, these persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared property value."
"According to the claims offered, the order of potential purchasers is determined, then the land fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokesperson of the fund.
Luboš G. obviously had information at his disposal about who had registered at the request, and since he himself was a legitimate person, having bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a real estate interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat severance.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the causa of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted because he issued land in replacement restitutions for which site decisions on construction projects had already been made.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. from the Land Fund also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, on the site where the construction of the access highway to the Borské Pole industrial estate was planned.
Later he exchanged it very cheaply with the magistrate for a house directly in the historical center of the city, which exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to give small parts to the heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred per month
From January onwards, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges and for district heating and, in some places, rents will also grow.
As of January, families will have to pull several hundred kroner a month more out of the wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places you will also be expensive for district heating supplies.
Electricity consumption alone costs housing budgets a few hundred kroner a year.
The high electricity prices have been reduced by all main suppliers, which means that the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic plants, is to blame.
Although gas is only moderately more expensive, it is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred more crowns are to be expected per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, district heating prices vary from city to city.
In particular, larger locations are planning price increases.
For example, from January onwards, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kroner a month for district heating, and families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 kroner a year.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, are threatened with 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges, and this in case the city increases infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous increases in rental prices are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will be abolished from January onwards.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
Anyone who does not agree with this increase in rent will be prosecuted by the company.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 homes today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Farnet, rum and vodka, for once also a good whisky, which was stolen from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks, after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen must be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who repeatedly have to sleep their hangover in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief physician of the children's department in the Central Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
"Whisky, if the father succeeds in taking a bottle out of the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or Vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that it can be mixed with juice, then it doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief physician.
The spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him.
"Most often it's about Fernet or rum."
"This is the current alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, which you take from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen-year-old or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception in hospital admission.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunk pupils from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12 when she was first admitted with 3.5 per mille of alcohol in her blood and in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at some dance party at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief physician wonders.
Especially the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in pushing their own offspring is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence on children in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol, including all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to the spokesperson of Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine by mid-November.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home after outpatient treatment by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police, will not be registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drink a bottle of booze in the school bench, Mr. Pelikán believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes that are 100% reliable: Walpurgisnacht, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for grief because of the bad testimony or for pleasure in the holidays."
"During Walpurgis night, I have already experienced seven drunken children at once in the recording," Dr. Pelikán emphasizes.
Paradoxically, a drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only has to fight an unpleasant hangover the next day.
In the morning after that, the headaches caused by dehydration and the lack of glucose can be dispelled in the hospital with an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without hurting anything anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Doctor Pelikán, sometimes spoiling the patient's good mood by enumerating the cost of the treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"In time and again, I used this as a means of education when I directly pre-calculated the children during the visit, which cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work all the time to earn the money for a single such party," Dr. Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures in order to demand the necessary costs from the parents to cure the drunken children.
Two training planes L-159 in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two L-159 light fighter aircraft, out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Seville, Spain, on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have been owned by a foreign army.
They were only seen abroad during maneuvers or flight shows.
This is about the two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are currently still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken them over last week.
According to the Secretary of Defense, Jan Pejšek, when she physically exudes the aircraft from Vodochody, is not yet known.
The L-159 single-seat fighter aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from long-term stored aircraft without any further deposits and investments from the Ministry's department.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were replaced in current condition and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to survive without two-seat fighter aircraft, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four redundant L-159 to a two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second wants to take over it by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to enforcing the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the customer of the L-159 aircraft and that it is intended to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer in what way he realises the case," Pejšek said.
The business paper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a transport plane Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not tendered for purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The then defense office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aero, of which only 24 were used, and the rest was going to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a judicial follow-up.
The European Commission brought an action before the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health stress, added Ms. Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the probability of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned above, which already form at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research revealed that testosterone in particular accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chair of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was aware of this study, but he still does not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a blanket of snow on Thursday morning.
On the streets and sidewalks is mostly stuck snow, the winter servants were in many places all night on the way.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This is what Novinky.CZ of the dispatchers of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK) said.
At kilometre 91 a truck crashed, at kilometre 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
A few cars are also in the ditch.
There are also problems at km 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
Drivers should leave immediately behind Brno at km 190 or drive over Brno and drive at km 182 at the village of Kývalka.
There are kilometres of traffic jams.
An accident has also happened on the D11, just at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a snow cover several centimetres thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Motorcades form, for example, in the town of Prosek, and the Štěrboholská road is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis unit meets.
There are also problems with the railway and at the airfield.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow drifts.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun route.
Travelers should definitely find out about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
Most roads in southern Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vyškov three side roads are completely untraceable, in the area around Brno there are snowdrifts in places and in the area around Blansko one is forced to use snow mills on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V
Three roads are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snow cutters for snow clearing.
It is not possible to estimate when they will be able to travel again.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
ČTK pointed out that there is a snow cover up to five centimetres thick on the roads, which can only be scattered with inert scattering agents for reasons of nature conservation.
In the Czech Republic, fresh snow fell from two to ten centimetres, most of all in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimetres.
Up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian region.
But in the Czech Republic it stops snowing slowly.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon".
The American troops have used a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise gun.
Your projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a hit safety of only a few meters.
The special bullets of calibre 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and contain highly explosive explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed so that they can explode not only when impacted on the target, but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use it against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technologies.
"The soldier basically does so: he visualises the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact target point, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to pull the trigger.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and shoots the bullet at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its subsidiary in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specializing in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their jobs from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokesperson for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should be a further 100 jobs for the Group, which were previously distributed across the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the space offices in Astro Park were better suited to the working methods of the employees.
Fujitsu had also been only a tenant in Bad Homburg.
Bernd Wagner, Managing Director responsible, said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt's economic director Markus Frank (CDU) said that this had once again won a "global player".
This is a "great site statement".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management about the intention.
"Of course, we offered the company our help," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
Now it is a matter of preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu up to now at the Town Hall Square and the neighbouring "Little Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects of the spa town with the remaining buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project between the city and a private project developer, a new city centre was created between the station and the town hall, which was criticised both for the massive construction of the previously partly used parking space and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens, bought the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu conucer is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves into Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are said to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - the Central Association of Electrical and Electronic Industries has its headquarters, among other things.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats Against Assange
Wikileaks is becoming increasingly distressed.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps this is behind political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
Wikileaks founder Assange is said to be in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is increasingly under attack in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
However, prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's search lists, is supposed to be in the UK according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks supplanted by Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the Land of the Free", the disclosure activists informed Twitter via short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) for the publication of secret diplomatic dispatches in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
Via Twitter, Wikileaks went on to say: "Excellent - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon has stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman have done research, reported CNN, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier, given the previous releases of classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman called for the platform to be prevented from being used on servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileak's illegal, monstrous and ruthless action is putting our national security at risk and endangering life around the globe," said a statement by the partyless senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the authorities in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on the search list of Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian resides in Britain, the exact location is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls for an assassination of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is afraid for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an advisor to head of government Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said on TV that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
In the meantime, the White House and Assange had a strike exchange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to resign if she was responsible for recent espionage requests to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The American government is now fully testing the protection of its databases.
The White House announced that the Vice-Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Actions, Russell Travers, had been appointed as the Special Representative.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary after the publication of the embassy reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced its intention to ensure the security of dissidents and activists should they be threatened by the Wikileaks release.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At the Gelato University near Bologna, ice-cream confectionery is prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the Gelataio and the Gelataio.
The gelatier, in German somewhat ancient the ice-cream maker, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-creammaking.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the fridge with a spatula, strokes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you can't get past the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest entrance and visitor from all over the world.
There are also several-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlor.
Some dream of a new career in the mid-life crisis, others just venture into the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag something of her own in a nerve-racking job after years.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the icing on the cake of the national and even southern superstructure during his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step towards making seems quite simple.
Luciano dumps the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees using an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all types of milk ice cream.
The lecturer is immediately besieged with questions: Can ice cream only be produced with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one let one's own desire for experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice cream without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within one day, otherwise it sags in itself, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
For taste in ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you on dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes a yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder as the basis for all sorts of chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano makes them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
The fruit ice varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavors, more fruit puree - this is not necessarily better in terms of taste.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream manufactures the working group that uses more fruits, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture really enhances the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation task: if peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano draws out a device by which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wincers measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computing easier.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the base mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is whipped creamy at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small breakdowns do not remain.
The Brazilian Gustavo grapples himself and his classmates with fruit puree from top to bottom when he gets out of control of the oversized rod mixer.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time before this happens."
Checkers in twilight
The European Food Authority Efsa was undermining the industry experimenting with gene plants.
The expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology, now formulates this accusation.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," said Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then in Munich on Wednesday.
Harry Kuiper, head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract to the Ilsi lobbyist association for years.
This is paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper had played a significant role in the Efsa testing regulations for gene plants and was thus in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticises.
The Efsa rules are word-by-word identical to Ilsi position papers, thus deceiving the handwriting of industry, which is supposed to be controlled by the Italian Parma authorities.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech has committed a conflict of interests.
A high-ranking Efsa manager, for example, recently became the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any conditions or a transitional period - and thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently revealed personnel links between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which the Federal Environment Agency, like the EU parliamentarians, has made clear.
However, Efsa cannot identify any conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of industry, should be used as long as they are of high professional quality, is stated in an opinion.
The experts who work for Efsa are not required to have no contacts with the industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper gives his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
Independent experts such as Then criticise the fact that genetically modified plants are currently authorised in animals without any feeding test and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does in the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how do you find them?" asks Then innocuously.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
As in the US, industry is now trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
As a rule, critical studies for companies would not be published.
"The industry controls security research," claims Hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of the Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: in September the excavators had moved and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When construction stopped, much of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, installed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't disappear."
He enthuses: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled like smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the chunks.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all those who hit in the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden pad that once was a guard house.
He said that he was insulted and threatened when the newspapers said in September that he had bought the remnants of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything for the demolition.
And if it were to happen, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were to be reused.
About 200 S-21 opponents took one of the 80-kilometer quadrants with them, price per unit 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of being able to return it during reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half are still in the forest, the rest has been sold long ago.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
From everywhere they had come and towed away what trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the impetus have long since been transformed into "mäuerle" or into limits of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He gets into his off-road vehicle, takes a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and dropped out, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany he gathers his treasures.
He says he's the Republic's biggest old stone dealer.
He's slowing down.
In the snow lie artfully carved sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbstone, yellow, warm, it's swarming.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up through the forest.
It points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
Let's go.
"Nice travertine."
Once the Quader belonged to the grandstand of the Stuttgarter Neckarstadion.
Stones and stories all over the snow, Cannstatt Travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones were used to be cut by hand and moved with simple pulleys and ox carts, he becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal to shred such a thing."
He didn't get rich, he didn't get rich, he didn't get rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone merchant today, as well as stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the recycler.
Soon he'll have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be saved.
Talent struggle for high potentials
There's a big crowd at the buffet.
16 students are pressing for salmon buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they are supposed to talk about the car of the future together with VW developers - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls before they come to the job market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish lists of the achievements of their students, they try to spot and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Braunschweig, the car company promotes the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students are in contact with the industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, VW can get to know students, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be eligible as employees."
Such cooperation, says Selle, is not unusual.
New was the fact that so offensively around the students was beckoned.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the newly graduated will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they have to pay for themselves and, in particular, for highly skilled workers.
Graduates from engineering disciplines in particular are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Verband Deutscher Ingenieure VDI, more than 40,000 engineering jobs remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt in which participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate, decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
Dykta says that the guns are getting bigger and bigger in the rushing and rushing around the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to open.
"We still have contact with all participants of a similar campaign last year."
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to direct shopping on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also go to the game at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Approximately at Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, Head of Human Resources at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young people.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company website.
"It is very difficult to occupy vacant positions right now."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that we can do internships or write our diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not popular with solar specialists.
For this purpose, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large company often cannot offer this," says HR manager Stübe.
Money doesn't play the main role in finding a job anymore.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute prepares an annual list of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
HR manager Stübe also hopes to gain points from the placement with the job seekers.
"I think applicants are looking especially at external evaluations of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In the sector jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within the own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise for their employer all by themselves with friends and acquaintances.
"This is like a game with gang," Kriegler says.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
The government in Washington has enacted a ban on this - and with it has definitively revoked its earlier plans.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast for the time being.
This was announced by Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster, which cost eleven workers their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce the US's dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not yet been fully resolved.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions of dollars.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe.
Currently, the competent control authority, which had been discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that more stringent regulation would significantly reduce the volume of production in the Gulf.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey conducted by BDO, a consulting firm, ahead of Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of crude oil spilled have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't lie down," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You'll get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to photograph a boy wading up to his chest in the water with the scallops surrounding him: in the rainbow-colored water-gloss the scene seems almost pretty.
It is not visible that brown crude oil vapours float under the surface.
She used to collect prawns here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the inert flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, vast amounts of crude oil poured into the vast wetlands from a burst pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the way through the mangrove swamps, crossed by rivers, the whole extent of the devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of light water, the motor boat digs up brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude like black licorice sticks out of the ground, sadly isolated palm trees leave their wedel hanging.
Birds swarms, as they are usually in wetlands, are in vain: as soon as the outboarder is silent, ghostly rest spreads in the former paradise smelling like a gas station.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari sinisterly: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battleground fought for decades: more than 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe invaded here, here in the 80s organized themselves with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell company had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is still denied return to Ogoniland: While over two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of three times the size of Switzerland with over 5000 wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken and the Group is in a position to be unstable.
Every few hundred metres, steel frames stand out like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christ Trees" are called the heads of the boreholes much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drilling head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres have flown into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year after year, the amount of oil that went into the Alaskan sea 21 years ago during the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who are responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU will be challenged.
While the Shell Group blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see burrowing drilling heads and leaking pipelines as the main sources.
Shell in Nigeria imposes much lower safety standards than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008: The rate of faults on the lines alone is "a multiple higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop under the open sky, the mangrove figures appear: they are chip-naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which can be identified partly with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, head of the group.
First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later drips out kerosene at the end of the line and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel à 300 litres a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
Delta residents are using the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still undercut the ridiculously low diesel price with just under 40 Euro cents per litre: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "Bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts, this way the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a small part of the temporarily intermediated raw material is illegally refined: organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion's share in tankers and spoil it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the movements of the population or to the lax mode of production to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies had not been perceived as intruders and if they had not destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni's relationship with Shell was destroyed so much that only a deduction of the company would be possible: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese would turn out to be better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"Highest time for you to disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the Special Forces Unit, they will not be arrested, but will suffer a painful bribe.
Like all Nigerians, the soldiers, who mainly come from the north of the country, also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," Akpobari says.
Investigators detect dangerous construction errors in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error during the investigation of an emergency landing machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the emergency Qantas airbus apparently had much more luck than they have known so far: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 aircraft during its investigations - and now warns against a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, according to an opinion of the ATSB authority published this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
It concerns engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which was forced to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a statement of grounds with an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire of the engine parts had loosened and the wings damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily dropped about three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa switched the engine off as a precautionary measure in an A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Snow has fallen almost all over the country overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and flights fail.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: In icy temperatures, almost the whole Republic is snowed towards Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
To the north and to the east lie some 15 cm thick snow blankets.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly new blowing up snow.
In addition, violent gusts swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Office (BSH) expects storm surges with water levels of 1.2 metres above the normal level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, snow drifts on the motorways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the storm control center Meteomedia, therefore, in Saxon Switzerland, the level of alarm was violet - the highest level ever.
Sometimes there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to heavy traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE had to stop its trip to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokesperson of the flight information center, a number of cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, there are still almost 400 cots available for them.
Accidents occurred on many roads already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: here, too, a truck was caught on a level crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing her car near Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
But the meteorologists still have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will already stir up with light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - in places up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters pretty: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernised; meanwhile, the bankers were allowed back to their old workplace.
But now the financial company apparently wants to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes, citing a spokesman.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it back," he said.
This means that Germany's largest credit institution will return its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and subsequently extensively renovated.
The energy conversion devoured the data according to about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open at the moment, the speaker said.
Thousands grieving for dead buddies
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Less than two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been lowered into the accident shaft, but had discovered no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now family members and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in the bright sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They kept quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were set up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the mates could be seen.
Images and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country the flags blew on half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come "from the depths of the earth" to the surface again, said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial ceremony.
The first explosion on 19 November had also spilled miners of British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
Hell, warriors!
Does Splatter match the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have been thinking of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents in rows with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and rips his enemies' guts out of the living body when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, does not say a word about the whole film, and even the other characters can at most be carried away to one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, silence is kept and faded in Scotland's creepy, beautiful hilly landscape, which provides the backdrop to the Viking world from about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cineas with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera drives.
It's nice if a movie has multiple target groups, it's only a pity if they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but refuses stoically to make his works accessible to the mainstream or slightly less brutality to the Arthouse with a little more humor.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the splashing brain mass and intestines.
The action fans die from boredom at the latest when one-eyes leave for Jerusalem via ship with a group of violent Christian missionaries for freely interpretable reasons, and are stuck in a fuzz and fog for an eternity before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
No wonder that "Walhalla Rising" did not find a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-threating façade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a fever dream that has become filmed.
And there is no escape from it for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack slowly closes his throat, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blond boy, who is loyal to the eye, keeps something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means ruin, but perhaps only for those who are already depraved.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, excitement and wonder.
It's an experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country refuses to comment on this - nor does it allow controls.
Around midnight from September 5th to 6th, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates River; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the block with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that is draining from the electricity.
According to a briefing by the U.S. intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the 1950s is hardly suitable.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By computer animation, it showed where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos showing the building nearby or even the interior.
It was said that the reactor was nearing commissioning, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, little more is known than then, yes, the puzzles became larger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was quite sure of the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, there was little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence professionals in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "alleged reactor," even though they think the CIA presentation is "presumable."
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
When asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat answered in the summer only lapidar that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The Syrians quickly removed the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly flattened the site.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, through a Member State, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial operators from the period immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always affirmed that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus declared.
However, after analysis of the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
It also refuses the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
As a result, the investigation of the case has been slowing down since June 2008 and is "increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA is monitoring.
The IAEA apparently sees three other facilities as the key to progress in reconnaissance, which are supposed to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and which are not yet in existence.
The inspectors have so far not disclosed which installations are involved, nor what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, Isis, has identified these locations and identified a complex of buildings near Masyaf on satellite images, most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military base - precisely on this grounds, Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the USA to spy out military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the US secret services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material has been transported back and forth between the three places and the block at the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there was "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb was to be separated from it later, there are plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could contain valuable traces, was stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the debris has remained.
The al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, which investigated Syria in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste repository, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria did earthwork at the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicions.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only the effort shows the great interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also ironed this proposal.
A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna had appeased that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter was not a matter of great urgency, for example, U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing into play so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, there is a need for a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and a number of the 35 countries represented there are far from eager for escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat points out: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her nameless directorial debut in the summer, there's been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's enough for unrest.
The rumor that the woman, a Muslim woman, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war is stubborn.
Bosnian women's associations protested immediately, and some planned shooting days in Sarajevo were transferred to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is in Hungary and in post-production, but there is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female victims of war wrote about the UN refugee relief agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself ambassador of the UN refugee relief agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, their organization has recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But exactly what scenes did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got its script to read, has granted a filming permit for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it is not quite clear why Jolie still did not come.
The young author herself affirms that she has no political intentions with her film, that she has worked hard into the Yugoslavian conflict, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, it remains vague in terms of content.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating on the net, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other in it before the outbreak of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds a lot different than the variant "rape victims fall in love with torturers".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that's for sure.
According to Jolie, the pressure on them is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace: by putting the script, like so many before, illegally on the net.
Let's get out of here.
On this evening it is finally going really round for the Irish.
There's no sign of grief.
But the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans john with joy at crackling loud music, they stomping with their feet.
The Bailey-Pub in the southern Irish Cork shakes because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and hit.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 Euro win bonus plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself by distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun playing in Las Vegas, he will be conducting job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a queasy feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and yet I don't have any work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a jerk, her wish job as event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, according to experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
A heavy loss for the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
If the forecasts are true, a wave of emigration is comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, now again Tristesse is spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling for the young, well-trained Irish, for whom it has so far only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under thirty are without work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from young emigrants complaining, "Everything goes down the drain in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but anyone who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one will turn off the light, please."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future as the government is only blinding and offers young people no future prospects.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes her fellow students shimmy from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
In doing so, men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "Working AbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers all-round service on the topic of working abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year what it feels like to build something elsewhere.
Because there was nothing left for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they're just moving up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan only rarely sees his home in the meantime, because he makes extra shifts in order to pay off the credit for his home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, when he first steps over the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again."
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cooled-out rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister O'Donovan bought the house for 4 years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent loan financed.
"It was crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it might go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start anew."
The civil engineer does not like the wailing that he hears often at the moment.
"No one needs to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it will make us feel Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes that thought.
Leave the future open and just see what's going on with life somewhere else.
He already has a few years of work in London and why shouldn't things go well in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend?
But there is one other thing that worries him a lot these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might turn into a good-bye party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a away party, easy, with some friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democatric Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These were the results of the Latinobarómetro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year's survey from September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of supporters of democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp slump last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% trust their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts to promote democracy.
The fact that this continued during the Great Depression may be due to the fact that Latin American countries have only experienced a short period of recession and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only marginally in 2009 and fell by 32% this year.)
But there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less so.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a greater problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
About 31% say that either they or a family member were victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the levels have fallen and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and market economies: around 71% of respondents said that the private sector is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9% unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
On the other hand, respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries see the most influential country in the US, with Venezuela taking on this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A sloppy election
No one expected that the elections in Haiti on 28 November would be perfect.
But the facts far surpassed the fears of the election workers who hurried to help the thrashed country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot tickets in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Voters opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, roamed around in search of an option.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded that the election results be lifted due to an alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election "as quite good in many matters".
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial claim for invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no vote in favour of the voters, declares himself the winner of the runoff election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims are still living in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organisation.
Shortly before the start of the election, approximately 250,000 identity cards that are required for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves agree.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%. That’s the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help her to re-election next year depends on whether the obviously grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who continued to direct economic policy after his wife's election, often drew up budget plans that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further discord.
Some regime critics from the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian slapped another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it," the President said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money on his own initiative.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction as its main objectives, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently reformed official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate path now?
It has called for talks between the private sector and trade union leaders.
And official statements suggest that wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt of a major devaluement in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous debt rescheduling in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the funders from the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
Last month, however, the Minister for Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her term of office, even without her husband's support.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which largely has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of the sympathia that has been brought to them will have ebbed away.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to lift many of her husband's political decisions quietly and quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching closer ties to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the strait?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters, set up to elect mayors and city councillors in the five districts, which is considered to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By establishing groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed relations with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only a short one.
Although its Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes, and the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-swiveling mass parades and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious attempt at murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a standing spectator was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which gave the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to focus its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also avoided to incite the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for her part, wishes to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese are in favour of its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, it also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It prefers to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former Party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
However, under Tai's rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP struggles for the voices of the professionals and youth.
Tsai was widely supported by the DPP as a presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that she, too, is able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans to create an idea as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires non-prejudicing discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas' hasty approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said that the candidates of the DPP had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's intervention, the DPP struggles to elect its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reshape his cabinet and local institutions.
The strong emergence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is in favour of re-approaching only to a limited extent.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no turning back."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you act on the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual, but it complies with the Grammy rules that allow an artist to publish at most three albums prior to the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its lively voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success comes closest in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination Spaldings.
Furthermore, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category instrumental albums. This favourite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbing favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, in which other albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are found.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category of large group. He thus competes against the Billy Child's emblem with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and premiered in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifice - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
As composers Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinenkonzert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with Orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he had written the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestral Performance for a recording of Stravinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
This year, only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Prokex and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre is in line with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"There are wonderful people living in this valley."
The meeting started at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the voices distributed fairly evenly on both sides according to the press enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," was a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is over."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filter manufacturer.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style should have two minarets and become about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered necessary for life.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"That makes it very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' form of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies from Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which will be published on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California’s Mono Lake continues to grow even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, Anbar says.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake due to its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, it assumed that microbes, both exposed, may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it is chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so big that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it smears almost everything," Anbar explains.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has been no working example.
Arsenic occurred more frequently in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early Earth age," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that were stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff of Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown people stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is the dogs are good," says Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide precise information on the location of the dogs nor on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to say more about this," Whitmore explains.
"We're following some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder's fee to anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's fee would be paid.
The lion roars again after legal approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainties, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "preparation" creditor plan to pay off $5 billion of debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new films and television shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. law, so that there is nothing in the way of the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will lead the somewhat slimmed-down studio as chief executive.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself contributes $75 million, is running the company. Financing is expected to be in place by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial problems and pay off the studio's more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from scratch when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio produced only one film and created an annual plan of seven or eight films to be released in the cinemas at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films after "Der kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio will need a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed around 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, the largest shareholder of which he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gimmicks can tear a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently I visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more efficient and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider offer on the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button cell-powered toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys are "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children over 3 years old) are plush figures as big as guinea pigs singing a note when you press on their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can't stop.
For a combination of gesand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays like 'Simon says', and thanks to the new hinged feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can be used to drive a car to a lesson, with a know-it-all with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games contained on it are not as educational as the ones on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together in words before time runs out. It’s great for an improvised spelling contest.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can buy, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a stuffed animal.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children over 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he can take a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in our dog's mouth.
Police operations in China are becoming more gentle
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked across an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, giving orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust city order guards, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their propensity to violence - to impress the audience.
"Stand straight!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely outgrown by the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped ribbons.
"For me, they look average," Mr. Tang says disparagingly.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green ones.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with staring at the ground: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled around an improperly installed snack van and stared at the operator until he packed in after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with a population of 680,000, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police patrols. They have been selected specifically for their appearance, good figure and youth.
They're supposed to give the rude police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly, according to the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officers in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death when he filmed them with his cell phone beating down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of the Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon merchant suffered brain injuries after a handcuff with five officials.
A video game full of violence that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street traffickers.
"Chengguan scares the government," the China Daily national newspaper lamented last year, following further controversy about tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the Distrik was looking for eight female recruits by ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women were supposed to have real tasks or just serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 with a good figure and "harmonious facial features" were sought.
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to the officials, the work for women over 25 is too physically exhausting.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official stated at the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job first depends on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's city administration, does not agree with this description.
However, it admitted that size limits in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon in China.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is equivalent to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical distortions do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lame or hunchbacks here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is patroling on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple packets and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn't feel sexist, so much emphasis was placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague, with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the short attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply to scare traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the patrol deals with about twelve street traders who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle before being chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've told you that so many times!" explains Ms. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is monotonous rather than exhausting.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who is studying sales in the leisure sector.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public hostility to which officials in China are frequently exposed.
This year hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rioted after rumors that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officers were injured in the nightly incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown over or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patroulated that morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, contrary to the regulations.
The owner yelled at Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers made their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male patrol, remained behind, turning his white name tag to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," Mr. Li explains soberly.
"Most of the time, people start fighting."
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys of the Department of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges that were brought against him after his affair with a former election worker and his attempt to lobby her husband, the Senator's attorneys announced on Wednesday.
This decision ended the most serious legal accusation against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that caused headlines nationwide and dampened his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
Senator Ensign's office announced that he was "very pleased" with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Ethics Committee of the Senate could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been terminated and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disobeyed the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election workers, helped to purchase lucrative orders to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was a treasurer during Ensign's election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over Hampton’s lobbying for them after hiring him.
Because Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to lobby for a year for his former employer or the entire Senate.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on the revolving door lobbyism.
According to the published evidence, "it seems to be an agreement and a violation of the revolving-door statues," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney specializing in the defense of clients targeted by the government.
While the Department of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the ministry seemed to be very cautious in taking up political charges after a variety of defeats persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously horrifying," said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Association in Washington (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in US parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who has brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a telephone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day that he was told that the ministry would not file any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense attorneys had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, the senator had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had put forward to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much is said: we think we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to close the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Group, according to which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons was in breach of the Federal Elections Act.
The election commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that, after Mr. Hampton was promoted as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a meeting with Mr. Hampton in which he informed him that he was "anklopping" at the Interior Department for a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also scheduled for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transport Minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they had hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
Last year, for the first time, information about this affair came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican ranks.
After many months of absence, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign would no longer be the target of police investigation, his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, the Senator, said that the Ethics Commission would very quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and close its investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calling draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them typed out in the riots in the courtroom.
In a minute’s time, they tweeted their reports of ghastly testimony.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape trial and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the verdict on the death sentence issued by the jury falls.
But Mr. Haye's attorneys have already filed applications to the court explaining the reasons for an appeal and who will employ the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - led to a "circus atmosphere" and such widespread, prompt penetration of seditious details, so that the jury was unduly influenced by public indignation.
This objection could lead the Appelation Courts to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"Just as I experienced it during this trial, I believe it is really a danger if the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's main defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of Appeals, rejected the applications by decision last week, when he said that the New Media would be "supervised" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic decision of 1966, the United States Supreme Court overturned the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who is said to have killed his wife, saying in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media.
Some people believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court appeals that Mr. Haye's conviction is half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in trials being persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellation courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many that Mr. Hayes' attorneys have set out to discuss for years, delaying a conviction.
The defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been pre-condemned when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the jurors' selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their fasters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge had mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecution, and that he had unduly put pressure on the verdict when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may have the greatest interest.
In a trial they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
"One such daily crowd of media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "was previously seen in New Haven and perhaps not even nationwide."
Her focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more incisive than reports that are being reimbursed more slowly is a technology-hostile look that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
But some lawyers said that appellation courts were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes needed adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's attorneys reinforce this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling, in which Dr. Sheppard's conviction was lifted due to reporting and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separating?
After a campaign of insults and negativity, little courtesy has erupted in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of genuine bipartisan cooperation or a moment of illusion before one quickly returns to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional leaders did not bring about a breakthrough in the major issues that had to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which decisions were no longer taken.
After all that you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party score.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that persist between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that conceals the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
That is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one demands the other sign of willingness to cooperate and compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Last but not least, Washington’s November election voted mildly for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections evoke party passions that die again.
And that's a good thing."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all of them, either temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, albeit only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferred tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, there has been an increase in optimism about agreeing on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratifying the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of lame duck session" will not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of inconsistency is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - that politeness leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what happens from now until 2012, as a pre-battle, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
No matter how worried the Republican leaders may be that they are poking too high, they know that they need to try to keep their promises to cut government spending and put health reform out.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are fighting hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, since on financial issues, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republican Obama challenges the state budget, taxes, and health system, later followed by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanism and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and the Congressional republics than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure foreplay for a far wider election in 2012.
From this point of view, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator on the issues that still separate the two.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of the "Kleptokratie" and it passes on part of the bribes and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are extorting high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, they say.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of authority" - takes its share of the money that the leaders are moving up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that he would have been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous defamation lawsuits against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when he was asked for a documentary that suggests he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has resulted in polls.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the Ambassador's report, individual persons are called, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between the government of Moscow and crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and to conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo says.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends over the police, the state security (FSB), the service authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the biggest companies and arrests the police small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get the protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is no longer as necessary as before."
The memo notes that, while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Country-wide, estimates By, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-state agency Transparency International (countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The disclosure of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened late at night after Moscow's time, will certainly cause displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront the past
In a light-lit, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds of the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge reign known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the government, long-time supporters in Anlong Veng are challenged.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the story of Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia for the first time condemned a former Khmer Rouge member when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society more difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides even families."
During Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government fell in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary waged the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok approached the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in the prison of Phnom Penh in 2006, where he waited for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few Khmer Rouge elitist officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from surrender," said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district head in the province of Manteay Meanchey during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told representatives of the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers were believed to have died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to subpoena her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, this would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court accused more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to go forward, Chhang Youk of the Documentation Centre said.
"Reconciliation with Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that as everything can understand."
The Centre created the first government approved textbook on Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often happens in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek mountains, a path covered with shrubs and covered with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned on a pile of tires here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will take a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees not to continue to accumulate weapons-grade uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's global nuclear security campaign, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Secretary of State Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
For years, the US government had tried to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But US government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements with Belarus have been made to remove 187 pounds of weapons-capable uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official staff member who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 nations" of April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they wanted a seat in the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has stated that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"We keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we won't make any dirty bombs out of it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the US a few months ago when it indicated interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Belarus' uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, say officials.
It was loaded into a special train that took more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say officials.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and, according to the officials, was carried out by plane.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as a telegram from the U.S.A. ambassador in Madrid shows.
This reflects the documents enveloped by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (via cable). It is added that former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which the aid was accused of infringing human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the report of the Council "had met Zapatero in the sidelines" and affirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain had no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed", in order not to be "unprepared to be surprised", reports Aguirre by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish government "would not pay much attention to this matter, although the government had little influence, since it was in the hands of the judges."
Prosecutor Vicente González, in his turn, told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Defense Minister on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," said the ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Department of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to operate discreetly between governments," Aguirre complains.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Minister of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are incredibly keen on their independence and do what they think is appropriate," he had given his staff instructions to "inflate rhetorical comments to avoid letting the tension slip away."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, out of a hint that the government of Zapatero's actions, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, will tolerate or deliberately ignore, will capitalize, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government," he emphasizes.

Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his former never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke apart and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him, he liked it, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free, do and leave what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address that I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that if everything goes well, she will take her firstborn with her.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. I will never leave him with anyone but my mother again", a dubious intention when considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes these, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and allegedly was murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, he is not."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he'll find me, such a crap."
On the 30th: "The boy is fine. He goes into a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer."
"Terror a la gallega (Headnote) ".
The last man who lived with her, an sworn hunting overseer, declares to have a bit of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she hadn't told him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred to the Palma Provincial Prison yesterday from the Center for Prisoners in Menorca.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not remember the course of events, "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and stowing his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutor's office applied for a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing on the parliamentary elections - ahead or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
The PPC won 384.091 votes last Sunday.
If this rising trend - as a result of the redirection of the PSC's vote and the binding of the PP's electorate - continues, the PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen in the parliamentary elections, while CiU four (now has 10) would gain and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one Member - currently has three - while ICV could hold its Member or gain one.
If, however, the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be in May 2011. Even then, the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scales in order to put an end to socialist domination, namely in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists will not achieve a majority, nor will they be able to rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd for this party to lose its representation in Barcelona's municipal council, where it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona’s turnaround, where they ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida lies the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party saw a significant increase.
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three others in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by police from the Barcelona Police Intelligence Department formed the jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the " Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the bombings in Bombay, which claimed 106 deaths in 2008 - provided passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which go so far as to assure that "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" the forgery apparatus of Al Qaida around the world and "so that its ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups of the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could pass the borders of European and other Western countries without penalty.
The exposed cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also participated in the investigation. It cannot be excluded that in the area of the EU there will be similar attacks in the next few days as the one that was carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had managed the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - stole passports in particular from tourists in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents had to be issued in the name of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to show visa stamps.
Investigations have shown that no links have yet been established between those detained in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Lashkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack in Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent out by means of a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", which put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone the tax agreement
Yesterday, the chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity to present to Artur Mas personally their terms of office in support of his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already made during the election campaign and can be summed up by the primacy of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leader intends to propose at the height of his mandate.
The chairman of the Catalan People's Party certainly turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 MPs she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining in the vote when he took office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible Entente with the PP. However, the discussions that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
With regard to the party chairmen of the PPC, it demands that, in support of taking office, "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial compensation between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum be withdrawn.
Both political leaders are in common that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat deal with the details of the negotiations for the inauguration of Mas.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home for the elderly confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not rule out the fact that their caretaker killed over eleven elderly people
The leaders of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot, Gerona, yesterday gave a press conference in which they found out what harm the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the caretaker who had killed at least eleven old people he was responsible for during his work - had done to the institution.
Joan Sala, the head of the nursing home for the elderly, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, came to court and announced that "La Caritat wants to sue the person responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution has to accept not only a social loss of reputation because it had not detected the criminal acts of the caretaker in time, but now also pay a large amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he had continued to murder ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home for the elderly - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that the formalities due to their age and illness were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat roundly denied this point and stated that "no measures could have been the reason for the incidents at any time."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no evidence in the lawsuit of negligent actions by a person other than the accused."
The one who was already baptized as a "death angel" confessed eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared that he had committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat said that the access of the personnel to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail used the caretaker in six out of nine crimes committed to rid patients of their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them out from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had confessed to three women whom he murdered between October 12th and 17th.
In La Caritat one does not believe the statements of the caretaker, not even as regards the number of confessed murders, which could well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his procedure suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they made it available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threatened Signs of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The risk premiums of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be mistaken and that the euro has hardly increased in points, which is causing concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which recovers to the extent that it collapses, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will by no means lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the closure of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt, as these were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of permanent access was to be maintained.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly calls for tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity to be maintained until at least June.
We also expect that the program to purchase bonds will continue and issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of yesterday's markets will be thrown back and if we insist halvingly on taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, at which the Bank confirmed that it would not consider buying government debt securities and that markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, which provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was rather weak.
The state asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in market perception according to Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures for the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated at about 10,000 million in the short term and a possible further 15,000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognise the stress test problem in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will have to receive parliamentary approval of its new budget, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven's ninth symphony.
The Spanish President yesterday presented the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions as well as financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound like Vivaldi's Four Seasons in the ears of investors.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we rely on a strong demand that will remove all doubts about our rescheduling capacity.
For Spain, applying for a help plan would be self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in keeping with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now it is not only being but also appearance that counts."
Courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Eulen contests the shareholders' meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the Eulen and El Enebro companies, does not fade away.
David Álvarez, founder of the company company, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, since he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest business services holding does not seem to be willing to give in to his dispute over the control of the El Enebro bodies.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who appointed themselves as Board members at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The General Assembly of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court number 2 of Madrid for the 16th, triggered a new thunderbolt in the lap of the Álvarez family.
Invoking the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as "a desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have the annulled Assembly of 18 January recognized by means of legal cunning, fraudulent machinations and abuse of rights", as official spokespersons explain.
This argument is the basis for the contestation of the Assembly in retrospect, in order to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who envelop themselves in discreet silence, tried in June already unsuccessfully to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the real background to the case which the judge has to decide on in the hearing to deal with the action for challenge for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this exquisite universe of speed has been characterized by surprises and successes.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last season, all of them put on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari in the final sprint last November.
Without trying to reduce the capabilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon" which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands and thus created a winning team has become a legend.
In reality, this is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This software program, known as PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is used before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and execute the changes and improvements that can be found on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm states that in 1992 on average ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bull’s team. They perform analyses and all possible changes to the racing car with powerful computer systems.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all components of Red Bull's racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are being changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula One team can spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a place 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff consists of 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula One hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer places in the service of its participation on the racetracks, other protagonists hide, whose support is invaluable and whose awareness is zero.
Steve Nevey, head of technology at the plant, pointed out that five years ago, it was possible to say that progress in the field of R&D contributed 50 percent to the victory for racing cars and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDP, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years' time
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
It is the first of a twenty-shop network of 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees on this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP España's vice-president, Helena Herrero, gave an example of the converted shop at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group of companies intends to set up 200 outlets in Europe by 2010, of which 20 are in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mrera did not want to betray the upcoming reopenings, but did not exclude that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice-chairman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the shop opening philosophy is always the same. She relies on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales network was intended to "optimise the customer service and advice of small and micro-enterprises in purchasing and after that, even packaging."
The Barcelona store has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as private customers, as large companies already have service contracts for technical after-sales service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal a million customers from his rival in three years
Banco Sabadell’s executive board member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in interest rates, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a still too existing subject.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without taking advantage of the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you deduct the customers that the bank will lose - which is the great challenge facing this bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has upset all banks’ plans worldwide.
Sabadell will conclude its four-year-old Optima guidance plan this year, initially designed for three years, but due to the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The clients who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by APIE Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would only come out of the crisis "slowly".
Moreover, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - which penalises the interest margins - will fade away, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their issues to maintain liquidity will already be passed on to the price of loans as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the rooster off, but the interest differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to limit the granting of long-term loans and increase interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the Stategie , "to increase fees", but "within a competitive framework ".
Sabadell's guidance plan is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not exclude corporate transactions.
It is not for nothing that he assures us that "larger companies are necessary in Spain."
"Everything will change next year," he assures.
It stresses that the need for capital is currently "enormously increasing" and does not rule out the possibility that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red figures.
He felt that the FROB could replace the money market in the event of capital stockpiles.
After confirming that Sabadell could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but unlike the events in June, short-term financing could be obtained through repo transactions and thus the crisis could be resolved.
CECA excludes a second wave of savings banks
The CECA Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a merger wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the sector was being restructured.
When the Spanish savings banks' concentration process began, several savings banks did not insist on participating in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, José Antonio Olavarrieta, Director General of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), said that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed, and the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be regarded as a second round, but rather as adjustments."
"Most of it has been completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was completed as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process that was established in earlier times, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he emphasized.
Olavarrieta stated that "there are a number of inappropriate opinions about the slowness of the process, the unseriousness and nonsense" because "Banco de España exhorts us to conclude on time before the end of the year."
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" the whole world and added that those who doubted this would do so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic environment, we need to "not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the ECB’s stress tests in July very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to retain the euro, but at the same time has established conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the lifting of the EUR 426 support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, Deputy Head of Government Elena Salgado supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany is taking on a fundamentally new perspective for shaping our future, which collides with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second is the reintroduction of the German mark - although it sounds more like science fiction at the moment - supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a transformation of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict financial management; punishment of the countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the suspension of payments by some countries as well as the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time. That is why there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government withdrew a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of the drift between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was set by the Central European country when Merkel painfully pushed out the decision to rescue Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the public opinion were absolutely against saving Greece.
Finally, Merkel comes out again in the last days of October with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time for private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it spurred the Irish crisis and all of the following.
But their proposal, albeit somewhat sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be taking part in the reform of the European Union, which will allow for these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures must be taken now - the old functioning of the euro will no longer be possible from this date on.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the opposing countries will be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent and in this case the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to take a hard course in growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as led by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not understand.
It is not just a matter of reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will move into more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like it would change anything.
Among the options envisaged is the fact that we would have to leave the euro area full of less serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sport and regular circulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The exclusion, allegedly initiated by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League, led to a lot of ink being shed about whether or not it was an unsports act and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed penalty in the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules followed in this sport.
Part of the debate about the case presented is that a team from the Real Madrid football club (who in his anthem pretended nobleness and honor and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the leading role in this, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added one episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behaviour, which is not explicitly prohibited by the Statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts constitute a rule-making process. Indeed, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to the sporting spirit should be investigated.
The sport spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the opposing players gain an unjustified benefit from the counter team. This did not happen either.
The paradox of the Real Madrid players' action is that it does not correspond to what we normally mean by misappropriation or circumvention of rules, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but should be as conspicuous as possible for it to be punished by the referee.
The players waited and accepted the penalty joyfully.
Another question is what kind of benefit the offenders drew from the deliberate fouls.
It should be pointed out here that the rival was not placed in a less favorable position nor was there any advantage for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually also withdraw. Moreover, with this approach, the players receive a sanction and pass into the second card cycle, in which they exit with a card less than in the first cycle due to a pile of cards.
This does not make it so clear whether it really is an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not against the sport spirit, which also includes strategic decisions to maximise the benefits of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a sanction (this would actually be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), they rather wanted to choose when they would submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or fleeing from a punishment.
Although the boundary between inventiveness and the regulatory environment has been blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemics arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the kind of provoked rule transfer.
The damage done by these actions to the principles of sport is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer campaign to catch customers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread out. They don’t want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas period, which supply the catering and leisure industry of Barcelona with oxygen. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive in order to capture the customer segment, which represents the great mass: Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To make accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (Silverster falls on a Friday) dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of dinner reservations on two top days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to give up this tradition, many workers pay for it from their own pockets.
Whatever the economic situation, the lowest prices are required, confirmed Gaietà Farràs, President of the Barcelona Board of Restaurants.
The representative of the umbrella organisation does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it 'tirely before they reserve."
"They want to go out, but they pay great attention to prices," he stresses.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service", he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices of 25 euros are the most in demand.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of 17 December leads the providers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be booming. The Group has adapted its menus with complete offers of between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
With AN Grup, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, one does not lose the optimism after the second quarter the revenues bloom again and good, although concentrated on a few days, prospects for the Christmas business are expected.
Sources from the Group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
In addition to the six group menus, a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added as a price hit. One has the impression that the customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Some companies also see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back in the upswing.
On the part of the Fecasarm umbrella association (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "lively" overall, although the customers "beat out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebrating had not declined, no matter who pays.
Pakistan’s nuclear programme is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad makes nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileak revelations confirm Taliban-Pakistan relations.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department of State revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistan nuclear program Washington.
On the edge of the clarifying and succulent details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries is not reinforced in terms of nuclear security, but rather is "abolished" on the contrary, and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhytmus than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack - make Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are listed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the Taliban-attacked area, the probable dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer seen by the US alone, but also by Russia as an outburst and reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan must hire strict religious personnel to guard nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that the cooperation between the US and Pakistan in terms of nuclear proliferation is slowing down and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" explains: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers to help, or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic catastrophe Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington to "clarify" the person responsible during a visit by General Ashfaq Kayani, Chief of the Army, that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high person responsible for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning to persecute and find Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can be solved only difficult.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" for the "finding and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional order of arrest.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the recent disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
Already on the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority from the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and locate Assange, "in order to arrest and deliver him for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states, according to the organization, regard the red warning as a licence for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is probably present.
The action outraged Assange's lawyers, who issued a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested to leave Sweden and was compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security, by the prosecutor.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," the letter accuses.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia affirms the innocence of her son - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location. During the interview, he applied for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a high-ranking figure in charge of the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, with preventing new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama’s spokesman to pay less attention to Assange contrasts with the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators have expressed these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January onwards, has called on the Department of State to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and prosecute anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "murdered."
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason, and all that is not execution is too mild a punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the tens of years an internal turmoil in the ranks of the ERC without direction after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that today the influence of this sector is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not cause him the same headache as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the beginning, it was announced yesterday that the more than 200 Regional Council members of ERC could speak out in secret about his stay in office.
With ballots, not with a high hand.
If the carodists wanted to give the president a parking ticket, they could do so without fearing reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he affirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without stating percentages that a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod allies are demanding more from the president than just providing the party with its office, an inadequate gesture, as Puigcercós controls the supreme body of Congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to encourage resignations, they will agree with the board on a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which will be submitted to the Council for vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, he is to promise to move the congress forward to the autumn of 2011, which the party leader already thinks is a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes the "polyphony" is a pity of stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by incumbent Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it to be a fact that the party president was supported "in exchange for various goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the Executive Board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the general assembly principle as a way of functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the Statutes, which should enable congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcercós's team, who fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with the end of the general assembly model - an exception to the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the quake assembly in 2008, the party leadership was charged with reviewing the general assembly principle at a congress that was to deal with reforming the statutes.
This date is still pending, since infogle's internal rest of the last few years was not advisable to tackle this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors lying in wait, the time may have come to take up this matter again and to conclude it forever.

Next to him, the police found a cardboard box with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
At COP16, China’s representative said that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and that it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16, assures.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and convert its industry.
He said that over the last four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work on this matter with the international community.
He explained that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress had been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included the objectives of reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities had worked with the central government and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he said, several multi-year plans have already been launched or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those receiving funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Effective Use Programme, which has been introduced over the past five years and has received United Nations (UN) investment, government and private hands.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs through energy-saving bulbs, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, scientific government advisor on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts were far greater than was generally believed to be.
He pointed out that per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tonnes per person, while in the United States they amount to 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent over the last five years and another is expected to happen by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former president of the party had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and to demand what the law would grant him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right was to him.
In an interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state prior to the appeal, he stated that the exclusion of Espino was a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right in his case to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge stronger from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt choose the or the best chairman Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would transfer the stakes "to the one that the Council would determine."
"I am unconcerned and open. I would be proud to give each of the five the office of party chairman."
He predicted that the party's recovery in the last elections of July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about assisting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the demands."
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón about his discourse course in his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI's supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, should they finally get out of the closet," he affirmed.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the federal government would be able to make expressions such as those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no ban on the mouth and even less censorship.
Obama advocates the law in Twitter for undocumented students
"If you are in favour of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and urge them to pass this law," the President of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are in favour of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and urge them to pass this law," Obama tweeted.
His brief statement contains a cyberlink to a broader document that calls on the public to get in touch with their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except the extension of tax reductions from the Bush era and the government's funding would be extended.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, Robert Gibbs, President-in-Office of the Council, said that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable can be set for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the process of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would apply for the vote on the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act could be voted on by the initiative to legalize undocumented students in the Senate from next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American Dream, would legalize about 800,000 young people who migrated to the United States when they were less than sixteen years old, lived in that country for the last five years and enrolled in a higher education institution or army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes in order to pass the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organizations of the advocates of this project organize an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of which the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most sought-after Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they wouldn't support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act is facing the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Love of Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand about the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentinean writer sweetly spits at the audience, composed mainly of young people gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz later identified as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to know what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not receive an answer, but receives hints for the guide of her narrative.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the corridor, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst escapes the secret: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps are mixing.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story, which he called 'the lobe of invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story turned around and told of America, the great novel that from the beginning did not lack its own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the fake witness who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even lost the sense of shame."
However, he points out that "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things", and there reality and lie approach each other, where one no longer knows to what side the narrative belongs, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"From him we have inherited to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIl's invitation to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman devoted her contribution to the great wound of social violence that is affecting her country - as is the case in Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not deliberately planned commitment," she explained, after highlighting that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer" hevorhob.
He noted that in a fast-paced world, the intellectual habits and control of consciousness also amount to dogmatisms, forgetting that "there is a little no behind every confirmation and a little yes behind every denial."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuances often mean putting your finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noted and invited one to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the match, there are also two different styles set by their respective coaches, and their encounter, marked by opposites, is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has been doing well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has advanced with the medal to the second champion, he has stayed one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santist strategist reached the first final as coach of the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with whom he got a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a setback again, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros was undecided after 210 minutes, but at the penalty he got ahead with 3-1 and got two ways to take his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be chased again by misfortune and free himself from the evil spell, in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I give up, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," the helmsman commented when asked about the lost finals.
The last final has remained in his memory, he assures us that he has learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared with two penalty points to withdraw, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootout does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at penalty shootout, you want to finish in the regular playtime, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce striving to hold the title already in our hands, that left us something for this endgame, and we hope that it will not happen this time."
It is in Romanso's power not to be only second champion anymore and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring with them.
The US changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must present themselves to the visa application service points before talking to the consulate, thereby reducing the cost of waiting times.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) before talking to the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of handling the visa is decreasing, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterpart to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to renew their visa do not need to have a conversation at the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation at the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the 26 dollar service supplement.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassisy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, which is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a prudent find for the search for extraterrestrial life," which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it can exist in hostile environments, which were previously thought to be uninhabitable, human-like creatures. The hypothesis was raised that these could be transformed into intelligent living beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It seems to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment considered too toxic for all possible life forms, as the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances increase that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, it is proven, according to astrobiologists, that "there is actually another life form, a second life form that differs from that known to us."
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its find at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles that of the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the Organ Law on Congress, the two-party system was introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and a block of opposition, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, was already installed, who imagined himself to be independent. The four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Before the introductory session began, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez von Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza von der PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo von der PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the Organ Law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties controlling Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Bureau led by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political marginality with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, starting from their political will, and if they did not, they would again be subjugated by both parties, thus putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"Until now I have come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group was formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolist".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that Congress should have an eternal two-party system."
"For starters, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues to make them more," the Convergencia member explained.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT pointed out in allusion to PAN and PRI that the Congress had at the moment turned into a 'expenditure' for two.
"It was just one party before, now they're split up in two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and assign them their place at the negotiating tables.
"It must not be left out because of top-level decisions five, which are likely to be nine Members; the five, which are currently seen as being split up into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform that has been carried out and agreed upon by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 more pesos for "the supplier"
The Mazatlán municipal administration pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year amounts to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this cheque with the number 9258447, issued to an amount of 200,144,56 peso, was issued last November 16 with the purpose of "accounting open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent in advance that more money would go from the community to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount owed to her and, as a result, the number of cheques still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, two of October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and this last of November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations requesting its services, the treasurer assured that its services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on July 25 the examination of checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it became known that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had already paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also transactions with Jumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán applied to the authorities to pay special attention to the areas in poor condition and to raise a bad picture of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, recalled that, on different occasions, it was demanded to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and sidewalks had had a negative effect, as the tourists came to wander and saw the disorder, and then they turned their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work in this way slowly and planlessly."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must take on its responsibility and avoid doing this again. How should it do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, we residents too have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy in order to maintain the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlan."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product has to be offered, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions constantly in motion," he added.
"Not enough attention has been paid to these arrangements, and this kind of incident exposes what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving Mazatlán's tourist sites because they were not used properly and gave rise to a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the fore together with the city. To make the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that first of all need to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism and to supply them to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a worthy parliament, free from collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is troubled and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, which makes a total of 40 representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right to act freely from collusion between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, transforming them into carnival comparators of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they carry out a trustworthy work and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas hotel association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary status in the state budget in order to promote it.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the second least means. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment to the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Funds must be allocated to tourism projects, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Holy King Is Wanted
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family longingly.
On the next Epiphany Day, it will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes, for the household is made up of no more than twelve persons and one goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no firm work.
"Sometimes it's hard times because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go out to the streets to sell with the gourds," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús proposes Cayetana clothing in size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would so much like this monster,' but I answered him, 'let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old María Guadalupe is 12 years old; the 10-year-old Isaías is 10 years old, while the 8-year-old Miguel is 8 years old.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in the size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the lobby of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estrie were carried out as part of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and will be charged with various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, which were said to have served primarily in drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security Police spokesman, stated.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons were said to have appeared in front of the Sherbrooke justice building hours after their arrest.
They could be accused, among other things, of accusing the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation, which took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the Estrien Regional Investigation Unit of Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Department and Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could be pursued easily
The Conservative bill, which, according to the government, will deal with the problem of ships laden with secret immigrants, will probably be thwarted after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I stand with a party that has put shackles on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, at the end of the weekly Caucus meeting in front of the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person identified as a seagoing ship for the transport of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian constitution of law and freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he opposed the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
Criticism about the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has turned the critics away, demanding that their party did not stand firm enough against the secret immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is precisely what we are trying to achieve by means of another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We are therefore not in favour of the Conservatives' draft law because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least one year," Chow explained.
Immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the Canadians' will.
"The Canadians strongly inform the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal activities that affect Canada and that treat the country as a stepping stone."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, one Conservative has said to the agency QMI that the government would convene a vote so that every opposing MP would immediately declare himself to his constituents.
The new unity does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible creation of a new standing unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the least at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Nor was it missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as a "hatted rabbit" and "made-up solution at the end of a table".
In turn, Minister Dutil had turned to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the question of future unity.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he contentedly affirmed.
"You're aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and political systems at the ENA (State High School for the Training of Senior Administrative Officials).
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposes that Quebec grant a special mandate to audit the financial statements so that they can investigate corruption and covert collusion.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the audit the same authority as Commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal law in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected the motorcycle police groups, 131 people were arrested, although the penal law had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has been pouring out in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has sunk into it.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains of 40 to 70 millilitres of precipitation have poured into several regions.
Between 20 to 40 millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were the most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had gone down here.
Since the snowmelt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm on the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière, heavy rainfall has led to the crossing of several lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte an evasive bridge was torn away due to the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, said security counselor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec National Flood Centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially reproved
The Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Board of Directors for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) for its controversial remarks about social welfare and Haitians as well as for its ostentatious speech on radio.
The CCNR believes that while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own opinion, certain statements "have contained inaccurate information about Haitian social welfare and unjustified negative representations, as well as such an unsophisticated manner of speech that is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasts in the period 2008 and 2010.
The first order was filed following a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators should provide sound information rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" would have touched on a sensitive topic in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was not blamed for his person.
The last point of the dispute concerned the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had submitted a media-effective dispute in this regard, which caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI presenter had declared that he had not donated in favour of Haiti aid, since one would not know with certainty whether the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative presentation of the Haitians.
"I have already forfeited my three-day suspension sentence on this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator explained.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of an unsophisticated language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, was supposed to have communicated its decisions once during the main delivery period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing as well as in Thai boxing, now rises in search of new challenges on the tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
"I started martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago," explained Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008, in order to develop further among the professionals.
Personally, I'm looking for the fight everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground fight as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the security official and UPS employee had given his rivals bad news in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship held between October 23 and 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won the win in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"At the moment I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"Those fighters from each category who had placed among the first four at the last World Cup had been invited."
"I made bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 I became eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished fifth in the tournament in China, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth noting that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, in which punches and kicks as well as floor throws are permitted.
The fights usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter that emerged from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal were to retain only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest-ranking and most prestigious in China," explained the likeable pfundskerl.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg), before losing in the finals.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face up to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has jointly approved $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a companion to Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over to the private sector its responsibility for this important hydroelectric project to the tune of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois parti, recourse to business consortia is a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of the transfer of competition and increases in prices.
"This is a new way of a mapped game and defuses the competition."
"This means that instead of being screened, you are now performing in an open form instead of in a secret way," said Sylvain Simard, MP of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, for it seems difficult to understand how public interest can be served in this way.
In the afternoon, Nathalie Normandeau, Minister of Resources, responded by vehemently denying that this was a cover-up game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she bet, asserting that the PQ had "been dishonest" and that it "misses her in hardness."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its workload.
The construction process is in progress and is expected to be in place by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition; negotiations had already taken place.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects, is by no means an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short flight over the Quebec Business Register allows to designate more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, is due to one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
With regard to the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made the nose of the fact that the contract for project management has been approved by agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prizes will go up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte affirmed.
This contract, granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance", is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Québécois Party.
The contracts were approved either by Hydro-Québec or by SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, which were granted to companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had received 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 Énergie gérance contract.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had suggested that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that "financed" it before she specified that it was rather their managers.
Barometers of responsible consumption - The "green" label is not a source of confidence
Greener, but unwavering skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but neither does he have confidence in the marked brands or eco-labels that are intended to guide his choice.
It is a pity, although it is bathing in a media-efficient universe where information is teeming with more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that is identified as a brake on its commitment, as demonstrated by the first reading held yesterday.
Although they advanced the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of the Quebec population admits that they do not believe the environmental commitment of the companies as much as the green corporate advertising, so the measuring instrument, sophisticated by the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke, reveals.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information about responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently being revived by nearly one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptiness and dubious character of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, they also preferred 61% of purchases from traders in their neighbourhood and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, trying to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, the social and ecological awareness seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that in 2010 they used public transport or preferred the carpooling centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds on stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-owned eXcentris cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent to hand it back to its actual cinematic function, apparently do not receive what they asked for.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond at a lower level than initially hoped, which could create a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of the sources taken out of the state rumor kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the request has been summarily corrected downwards since then.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is in charge of the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec ownership community of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there, which he did not also send to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic assistance.
Cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the cinema in his cinema complex for more than ten years under great difficulties after the self-financed construction of the cinema, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele at the bar.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are heading for a privately financed Campagne, of which they expect a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvoi's "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not called off the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward-corrected proposals that have been made to them.
Secret of Complex Shaken Canada Revealed
The new American diplomatic leaderships spread by WikiLeaks reveal the mystery of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority of the Canadians to the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the latter's sense of superiority towards Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind when voting, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicized yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantial content to nibble at.
A connection dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the missions discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador appointed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A complex of inferiority that is almost inherent in the Canadians may lead Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life much more than to blame the United States for this election (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), "he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it."
The ambassador understands this "dark silence" all the less, since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," he says, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the ballot."
The other expression of this sense of importance is set out in the communication sent by Terry Breese, a commercial agent in Ottawa, on January 22, 2009, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which was created by a revival program of 30 to 40 billion dollars," says Breese.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another announcement, dated January 2008, by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle allusions to Maher Aar, the "No-Fly-List" or even deductions for the purpose of interrogations carried out by the CIA's muscle prostrations can be observed.
Another report reports in detail on how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed the State Secretary a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The State Secretary has agreed to review the file again."
Finally, let's note that the minds are heating up about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had told CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had lectured here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (CFCs), equivalent to nearly a third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented in order to stabilise the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the steps of the concrete large-scale projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from the industrialised countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFC emitted from lighting to earth if the white-burning pears, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better still, light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide fleet.
Last year, in Copenhagen, major emission emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt would still have to be deducted from this balance sheet in order to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020, in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white annealing bulbs 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced once again by twice.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-burning bulb, which gives an indication of the savings of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that it's completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and therefore they have to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the producers provide a point of acceptance.
According to the report, however, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit much more mercury to generate electricity wasted by the white-burning pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars a year on the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need of the independent election commission to maintain its work and to publish the preliminary results without further delay," stressed a press spokesman of the UN head.
"It invites all parties and institutions of Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibilities and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had passed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue its work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, numerous calls from all over the world have been made that the CEI should finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of the elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, anticipates that the Constitutional Council will cancel "deceiving" votes in the north, achieved by the former rebel camp of Forces Nouvelles (FN) during the coup that failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN's maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the actions brought by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents are now more of the opinion that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North who denies any connection with the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in declaring the election results as "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His allies affirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, knowing that he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the election commission from publishing the results would be illegal.
The second round of Sunday's presidential elections were considered to be the culmination of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been split into two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians that it could be held responsible for any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round on 31 October with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as the leading candidate.
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable in the sense of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolitan area at 9.3% (including overseas departments at 9.7%), as shown by the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2.631 million.
Data for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% including overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
From a more detailed point of view, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find work, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not, or whether they were seeking work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed according to the IAA.
Seniors, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolitan area (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of those over the age of 50, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year-olds had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After an examination of its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office (Statistical Office) Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continued in this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), and he was sent to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of social assets, embezzlement of general goods, secrecy, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to speak out on all the questions the prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading fantasies."
"It is easy to subject him to a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," explained his lawyer Florence Rault to the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had insisted on giving the judge a memoradum for his justification before hearing with his lawyers.
A relative of Guérini's, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill running.
Simon said that he would never have been aware of the area of business competence or of the destination of the associated funds.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Public Service, was also charged on Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but then released under the authority of the courts to stay away from the protagonists of these acts.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts he was accused of."
"The senior prosecutor has considered not to deprive him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four others had been charged and released from custody on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two civil servants of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one of them on the grounds of the title "Hateful and embezzlement of general property by a public service officer", the other on the grounds of "complicity in embezzlement of public funds".
Jeannie Peretti, the partner of Alexandre Guérini, was also accused of "smelting and embezzling social assets".
Among the people opposed to Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of public fraud affecting Corsica.
The suspects suspect his company to have helped wash money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X concerning alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste management sector, will be conducted in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
It appears from close investigation sources that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediation function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spionage," kept the French public in the air, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the close eye of the United States diplomats.
The American documents preserved by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some backgrounds of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "giggling" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman has not delivered Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and sought by the American judiciary on the basis of trade in material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they cast a glaring light on the way in which the French Presidium tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French commentaries on the way in which hostage taking is handled".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, spoke with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do all they could to bring back their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
"Makes noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without ceasing" the words "basic human rights," "innocent," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do this."
Because "silence does not solve anything", the discussion attempts over inconspicuously, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common Iranian tactic": "aggression for the purpose of political blackmail".
He announced the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on August 16th, the day she fled to the French Embassy) "require payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
One information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is demanded by the United States due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from custody after a judge in Paris has ruled.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks to acquire the material intended for the nuclear program.
Has France accepted a trade in cows ?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French woman?
On the occasion of another meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidium and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under the "stricter" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant dials a telephone number, re-establishes, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediator role" through statements and media-organised "fighting attempts".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what is so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons which led the Elysée to succumb to this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008 that was "early and undeservedly perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad."
"Strengthening the Syrian role," Paris "trys to show Syria what commendation one can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier had entrusted her with the task: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything".
"But we thanked them despite everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Cinderella", which will forbid young people to play online games after midnight by blocking access to them, so government leaders indicated.
A bill to encourage online game operators to deny young people under 16 years of age access to these games after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, describing representatives of religious and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games were then again accessible from 6 a.m.
The producer companies would have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also takes note of asking manufacturers to reduce the time limit granted daily to access these games to those young people whose parents are asking for it, the person responsible added.
He would also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee will appoint the hosting countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a highly political choice in which the rumbling for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
But one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a little more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Katar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
The behind-the-scenes machinations are threatening to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important to the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the unveilings of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC had once again given it a breeding ground by broadcasting a documentary report that bombards three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English officials who have been lobbying intensively with David Cameron in the last few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of his predecessor Tony Blair's move, which in 2005 had achieved the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London.
Would this intensive effort be enough to revalue the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trump cards with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EC 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become a weighty outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the unwavering intimation of the British press's accusations of "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin bet.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favourites.
First world economic power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
However, these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA's eagerly awaited approval of the World Cup 2026 for China, which makes the Asian chances of 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the stops with the maintenance of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time shift) acquired by European countries, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: public awareness
De Gaulle had really cut it.
Mitterand had made him think he was cutting.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
One mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness is not well on the side of the mystery attached to the presidency function.
So you have to pretend as if there were doubts from now on.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, supporters of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in earnest that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011.
The fact that on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians he would sound the perspective of "two mandates" had thus spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President merely reminded us that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms of office to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he has mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"At worst, you still have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Do not think about the phase afterwards."
His words of the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; but also no less.
If they make comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the opening of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS exhort more early than accepted to the battle announcement.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," immediately and cautiously responded the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin says.
"He will always believe in winning," corrects Alain Juppé, who has reconciled himself with the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to come to a close at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt commits that the central bank in Frankfurt can undoubtedly not afford to put an end to the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French finance minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role played by the ECB in solving Europe's public debt.
It has not dared to say whether it believes that the central bank can do even more, for example by boosting its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels the day before, at his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, did not show much eloquence about his intentions, but was content to point out that the programme of purchases of government documents on the secondary market would "continue" and that at the meeting on Thursday "we will see what the decisions are."
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the Treasury were doubled from the ECB last week to approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, it is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state documents yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the traders, there is no doubt about the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price (see page 29).
The economists no longer expect a remarkable change in course.
If the borrowing operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will be able to cope freely with the unlimited reserves of funds over a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already counting on this measure to be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its intervention in the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of bonds that stimulates the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in euro area sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must replace the lack of investors on the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent the hasty enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weakest countries," testified a key bond holder yesterday.
If interest rates were to rise, states would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilising their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government is taking cover in Italy
After a worrying start of the week for Italy, yesterday the situation eased somewhat with the fall in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and had heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which he immediately denied.
On Tuesday, in any case, the German interest rate gap would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had led to a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that the gap between Spain and German interest rates was 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had, however, expressed himself as "very concerned" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, dizzy tax revenue that puts the state at risk of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget for the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the turmoil over a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, we have been repeating this for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high level of debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.), is calling for lower stabilization progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question of political unsteadiness remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure from the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow the early elections to be organised as early as the end of March.
So there is a little favourable period ahead for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about developing anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe that it was still proved on Sunday afternoon and evening: Europeans clearly stick together, are ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area".
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday on the interest rate feet of the European sovereign bonds was water on the mills of governments as well as the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to speak of a start to normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt note, which is probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility that weighs particularly on the banking systems," says the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, because "political times are much slower than those of markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to reinforce the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, in a broader sense, with their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the plan is the lot of unconventional measures to back up the eurozone countries in the cross-hairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling started his Asia tour in Singapour on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The EU Stability Fund's first paper expenditure is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative had entrusted Reuters to the agency, and the United States supported a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the IMF's additional direct involvement.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are in turn preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to the austerity measures, but are expected to have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have.
Both the one and the other have to avoid having to ask for international assistance at all costs before they have put in place their own budgetary correctives and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will bring them back in the long run.
European investors, in turn, talk about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take up its own pockets again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of European sovereign debt in the foreground, argue that an extension of EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This appropriation exists: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance to be scrutinised in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are increasing.
Snow and Ice: 24 departments in Alarm Level Orange
Snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange alert due to the imminent risk of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in the Orange alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers touch the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow blankets from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region are expected.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic obstructions and to affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to over 7.5 tonnes of heavy traffic, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was canceled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy goods transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires drivers to take utmost care on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Roissy Paris Airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfalls.
DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in southern London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry at Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
The 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is to be remembered.
In order to initiate the construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the ICP would then allow to lend part of the financial sum to its double on the markets.
After all, the first projections have been made today.
The 2010 supplementary budget, this morning reviewed by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax for the establishment and higher taxation of the offices in Ile-de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "to the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
The figure is: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to pass on this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
You're far from the four billion.
"It is said that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital invested by the State and gradually paid to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement states.
With the SGP, you don't find this system offensive.
"Since the moment one records revenue (the two taxes, i.e.), one can cover the project over three years and then draw only from the 4 billion", it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which 4 billion will be sought for a long time, runs the risk of creating a rather moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and busy spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a dual meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at an international level, giving a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go one by one.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence agency (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits throw nothing further than what was read over months in any journal anyway (except those whose owner Berlusconi is) and the horribly caricatured profile of Gaddafi had been offering cabaret artists material for their sketches for a long time.
The rule according to which secret dossiers may only consist of news already known is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to Esothermal publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (or because he does not know where news about the non-existent could be found), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The secret files, too.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why was such a fuss made about the revelations of these dossiers?
On one side, these state what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world holds the considerable blow against the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal puts less of the victims than the "sharp funnels" into trouble.
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, all power could be pooled like a Big Brother controlling every gesture of his subjects.
Since then Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one considers what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's avenger - can discover the secrets of power.
But how can a power hold itself that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secrets, as it reveals the public sphere; but revealing in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means robbing them of all power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this insult inflicted on such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer place any reserved information online - that would be like a display glued to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies it is in vain to hope to keep confidential reports secret over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future, and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents, moving in secret on uncontrollable marches, carrying their messages nowhere else but in the bare memory, and also hiding the few written information they have received in the heels of their shoes.
The information would be stored in single copy in closed drawers: basically the spy attempt of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like cancer these days, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for band by coiling from back to front and uncovering all the secrets of montage, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains will take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this will take you three and a half hours by plane, including the transfer.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to come back to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France talks its financial promises nicely
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the rapidly resolved financial promises (also called "fast start" or premature financing) made by developing countries.
And already the rough French fine speeches are revealed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million a year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU drew all the registers to convince its partners of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed action report from their Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
The transparency operation is remarkable and highly valued for its real value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it will have released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, which will put it on the right track to pay tribute to its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional commitment has been made without being to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that they consider best.
For example, the European Commission has chosen itself as the benchmark for the year 2009: international financing will be maintained and will add 150 million over three years as part of the "Fast Start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at official development aid level.
In return, France felt that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no indicative figures for expenditure in the previous year or at the global level of ODA.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France claims to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about that yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, find €1 borrowed as equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission control based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that is collected as the equivalent of a donated euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan should be credited to the investor country as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of it.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) pay 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfil its obligations, France only gives 10 cents and means a comparable commitment.
Nice hocus pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swindle: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; one intra-EU (why do the other member states continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of premature financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its accounting method for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently discussed issue): one cannot escape the question of "predictability" or the method of accounting for its loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "predictability" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international basis of trust that is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published this Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and respect of coming generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of samples analysed do not reflect a statistically significant value, but rather represent an illustration of the problem dealt with", had bought between July and September the food usually consumed by an approximately ten-year-old child at meals, plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were investigated, as were laboratory snacks looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe carciogen, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if in the approximate totality of cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, this survey is very well understood that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptor is worrying," the association notes.
Already at breakfast, butter and tea containing milk alone contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three of the safely proven carcinogenic residues, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of a strictly banned insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were sprinkled.
In tap water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer is "probably undervalued", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has in turn proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
