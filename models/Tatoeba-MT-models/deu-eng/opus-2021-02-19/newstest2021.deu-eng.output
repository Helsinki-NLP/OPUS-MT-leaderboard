Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening a traffic accident occurred on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Car driver overlooks biker
At around 9.30 p.m., a 44-year-old motorist wanted to turn left from Merklingen to Landesstraße 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim with her VW.
She missed the 24-year-old motorcyclist from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away during collision
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but he still roamed it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the stripping process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
In his mind, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffnesses next to the roadway and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
As a result of the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury to the patient and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
Security is monitoring the ban.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positively for the corona agent Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the district council office Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to avoid further spread, we have to take this step to protect the population," said District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Before that, seven employees had already infected themselves in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for insert glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
On the farm, infected workers were separated from non-infected workers, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
Greens and SPDs shared responsibility for the state government.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of seasonal workers' housing.
"This can take bitter revenge if such local infection incidents need to be exploited and regional lockdowns ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the Greens' parliamentary managing director.
This is very similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be closely monitored.
That obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak came "with announcement".
U-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the rail bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the underground station Aidenbachstraße around 4.15 p.m.
A passerby alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the platform bed.
People from the 17-year-old group helped the fallen man climb out of the track.
There was no danger from an incoming train.
According to the police, the two people then started to clash again.
The 17-year-old fled the crime scene at first, but his personal details could be investigated afterwards.
He was accompanied by his father and went to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer retention of data
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended retention of data - instead of the planned ten weeks a half year.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a quick amendment of the law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He considered it useful to "immediately make necessary adjustments to the law already now," quoted the newspaper from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments before they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report goes on to say.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it was only when the courts had decided that it would be useful to examine whether legal adjustments were necessary.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already voted in favour of data retention in June.
NBA: Strip Club Angry for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he still visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is back in Isloation, is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, already expressed his love for these very Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Inc.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to finish the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams are preparing for the season finale starting in the night on Friday with training games.
Söder comments on the Corona location after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has frightened authorities and politics.
Almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and over a third have become infected with the corona agent.
The farm is now quarantined and is locked off with a fence.
No one is allowed to leave the grounds, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the more than 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt so far assumes that the infections did not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience bites": Confession of the suspected arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown himself cooperative," said Quentin Chabert, the newspaper's lawyer.
The defender added: "He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "suffered by remorse and very much taken by the extent of the destruction".
According to the prosecutor's office, in the event of a conviction, the man is threatened with ten years of imprisonment and a fine of EUR 150,000.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged during a fire on the night of Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in three places far apart in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The now imprisoned suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly got into the investigators' field of view.
Discussing the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended thinking about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said Grindel of the "Picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work for the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous for Bavaria and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not possible to get around the debate whether it is necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations wishing to break into this phalanx".
However, he had doubts as to whether there was a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga business location in a single European market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money would not achieve a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are already immense among the first three clubs.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million", explained the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and stabbed the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive clock that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I've been very busy with that humanly."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift I have handled completely transparent and unsuspectingly.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He had never "made a secret from the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"That may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a dead man
The protests against police violence in the United States have intensified again due to Donald Trump's use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes between demonstrators and police took place in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by gunshots while a demonstration train was crossing a junction.
Previously, clashes had again occurred in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on the night of Saturday and violently dissipated demonstrators.
Hundreds, partly armed, marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student had been shot dead in March at a drug raid in her apartment in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found either.
When a member of a group calling himself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because of the formation of street demonstrators of a white militia.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and died in a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
The police reportedly took a suspect into custody.
It has not yet provided further information on the circumstances of the case.
Mayor Steve Adler, according to the New York Times, said he was, like many in the city, "unruly and stunned" because of what had happened.
Protesters in the American metropolis of Seattle also engaged in clashes with the police on Saturday.
They set fire to a construction car in front of a youth prison, the police used glare grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assault.
In Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of demonstrators smashed windows, shot down fireworks, and blinded police officers with lasers, reported Oakland police late Saturday evening (local time).
The fire could be extinguished quickly.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to the police, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was injured in the hospital.
There, too, windows were smashed in a court and a fire was set, as the police reported.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historic costumes defy Corona
Although the large lake was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city centre was missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale, Rakoczy-Ball or Festzug were burning, so many of the Corona-compliant alternative program came at their expense.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says Director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historical ones alone were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So this time in the Corona year.
The couple made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, observes the historical strolling and listens to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
They don't miss the crowds that normally belong to Rakoczy.
But she lacks the usual programme highlights, above all Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historical procession and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy Riding Tournament to take place again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant some more work.
For example for Christina Gold, who participates in the procession in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was on foot in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"This is more exhausting, otherwise we will have it easier," she says.
The equestrian association had less to do, even if individual riders were on the road in the park.
"We very much hope that the rider quadrant will be allowed to take place again next year," says President Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause in 2021, a Rakoczy Reit tournament will be held again.
28 Corona cases with Spanish second division Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football second league player CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer had flown to the city of A Coruña in spite of the first Corona cases on July 20, a low blow follows the next one.
By Sunday 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital, as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid still had the chance to reach the ascension playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B-group of the Second League threatens.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible offense against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced descent of the club.
The players and other team members are quarantined in a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel or gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
Photos show how players hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms at the hotel for drying after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
Neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, announced that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The charge of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The Spanish Primera Division's son Javier Tebas, as reported by the Europa Press news agency and the sports newspaper "Marca", said, had not been violated by the Corona rules established by the football association.
Before the departure, there were four infected persons until 19 July, but all of them were isolated and did not travel with them.
Directly before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, further team members of the Corona test had been positive for "five or six".
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the whistle, said Tebas Llanas.
Police must catch horses torn out of steamach
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, just before 6 a.m., a road user shared two free-running horses on the feeder between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld junction and the Theres motorway junction.
At the arrival of the officials, the horses were already between the feeder and the village of Dampach.
Shortly before Dampach, the officers were able to gain the confidence of the horses, so they were able to change a rope carried in the patrol car.
Tony Martin: Career-continuation conceivable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time time-trial world champion Tony Martin can well imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm setting the framework conditions with the team for how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona-Pause.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
In the past he got up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: What if".
The cyclist admitted that there were aspects with which he was increasingly difficult.
"But it was good for me to know from the Corona time what I had on cycling and how much fun it was for me."
At the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August), the time-trial specialist returns to the competition event.
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's streets at the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the tour ends fatally with the motorcycle.
Even an 18-year-old pedestrian dies.
Schönthal - In case of accidents on Bavaria's roads several, mostly young people died on the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was caught on Saturday at Schönthal (Cham County) by a car that came on the opposite track.
Why the car came on the countertrack was initially unclear.
In Upper Bavaria on Saturday a 22-year-old bumped into a horse-drawn carriage on his machine.
According to the police, he was on his way downhill from Beilngries.
In a left-hand curve, he bounced against the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, a man was severely injured and a man slightly injured, as the police reported.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He had laid down on a street the night of Sunday and was overrun by a 42-year-old driver.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Schönberg (Landkreis Freyung-Grafenau), a 57-year-old biker hit a car frontal in a right-hand corner despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the remaining three people in the car remained unharmed.
The safety of motorcyclists was addressed on Saturday by Bavaria's transport minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to Gabor Kovacs, the organizer of the Biker protests against driving bans announced for August, the Minister pointed to extensive investments such as underrun protection on guardrails and the defusing of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a lot for the safety of motorcyclists in recent years," the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheelers killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011.
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be guesting with the Hessen, the former club of the Croatian, on 1 August (18:00).
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only tough test before the rematch in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the Coronavirus pandemic, the encounter takes place without spectators.
"We are especially looking forward to this game.
It is always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac explained.
This is an interesting test for sports, said the 48-year-old.
Prior to his move to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led to his victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht trainer Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian in the concord.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the eight-elfinal match against Basel in their own 0-3 stadium.
Almost 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof just past the lockdown
In the county of Hof, the number of known new corona infections increased further on the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person is recovered and no longer falls into this statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the city court.
Thus, the Hof area approaches the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 dead due to monsoon rain in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people were killed because of the heavy monsoon rain.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent in boats is trying to reach the isolated people.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzernashornen in National Park die by landslides
In Kaziranga National Park several of the 120 tank rhinos died from landslides.
They are protected and considered at risk of extinction.
This year, floods are particularly bad, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built homes for 650 displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm also remains in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house were so small and like a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large apartment block.
Many apartments are empty, but - as the government wants - they are soon to be moved from those who have lost their house due to the floods.
60 new Corona infections in just one day in Vienna

Argentina rejects counter-offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Argentina therefore calls on its private creditors to renounce part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country will once again face bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government is sticking to its latest offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The last inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect economic strength to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid US$503 million in interest receivables and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"It's going great" - Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws this conclusion after her first days at the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very fast: in the middle of May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer began work, the normal daily business has long been on full swing.
"However, I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely move the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to guarantee the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she has for the time being also an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring rural district, the city of Eggenfelden has long been known to her.
During visits on site with her family in the past months, she once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her home country of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her traineeship period and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stops as a Notarassessorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered her doctorate in labour law - she took her first position as Notarin in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave and eventually moved to Regensburg.
Since then she has taken over representation services at various notarial offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden had been advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for the full career re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of their predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the notary office in future, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and immediately has a praise for the team of the firm ready: "It runs super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten and cribs, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be adhered to, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators", said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer to the "Tagesspiegel".
Usually the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In last season's ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal audience seats, some of the approximately 4000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the account if these revenues completely break away."
In view of the continuing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side-length for the first time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund-based marketing boss praised BVB professionals for their pay cuts, which should help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their pay cuts have a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny miracles: early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of around 400 young people who are cared for every year at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even one kilogram birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they would not be in voice - "and how", smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they don't scream as loudly as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the beginning of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the theatre of the city of Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the pupils - and this by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to talk about the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation had been born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of teaching.
Even if at the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional attractions, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: the TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should the TSV qualify for the DFB Cup in 1860, the lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup have been determined.
The lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt with a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because due to the Corona pandemic the participant field is not yet complete, placeholders were used at the draw.
Due to the voluntary waiver of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4th or 5th September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second-level champion Würzburg reach the final, sixty-six would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the third league.
"Gone by the Wind": film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died on Sunday in Paris at 104 years of natural death, confirmed her spokesperson of the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern epic "Vom Winde vergeht" (1939).
Born in Tokyo as a child of British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theatreman Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of the Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
The film studio Warner Brothers took her under contract for seven years and brought her out big at the side of Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film was screened in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiresse" (The heiress).
She also received much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier proposed her for the lead role in the filming of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her long-time friend Bette Davis, she played in "Weighing Song for a Dead Body".
Benjamin was the son of the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946–1953).
In Paris de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage, too, was broken.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale at Comeback
Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they had their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semi-finals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Most recently, Thole/Wickler played last September at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final match on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flüggen took a defeat against surprise team Lukas Pfretchner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretchner/Milan Sievers secured the tickets.
Kalbitz-Rauswurf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
From the point of view of the FDP, the exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said the FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of trial the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided in May by a majority.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his followers would have long since been excluded," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything," he said to the "World on Sunday."
"It speaks rather volumes, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume expects the AfD to land below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD Landes and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the stress as "secure right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
He stated that Kalbitz had not indicated an earlier membership in the now banned far-right "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and in the Republicans when entering the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing party in the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
This decision would neither weaken the federal party nor weaken the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troops is clear.
One wants to escape another observation by the constitutional protection and tries to get through under the radar", said Walter.
"The AfD won't get rid of the ghosts she called.
A throw out doesn't change anything yet," commented the Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the faction remained their right-wing leader until today."
The legal dispute over the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms provide 21 percent more electricity
Wind power plants on the German North Sea have fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet reported in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the grid area of Tennet, have supplied another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind power from the North and Baltic Seas thus reaches 13,73 TWh, compared to a good 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Wind harvesting at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, in addition to the wind conditions, because new wind farms have joined the grid in the last twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are currently investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot use up their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th.
Gmünder Kunstverein's birthday: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on southern Kornhausplatz.
To the north of the gallery was the association "Sandtogether".
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - knowing how difficult it is for those involved economically - we have hoped until the last minute", explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (unaffiliated).
"But in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people as organisers."
Because if tens of thousands had flown into the festival grounds and the tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and a contact tracking according to the current Coronaschutz regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by many times.
Rumberg comforted on next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 as well as the day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories at four starts this weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also not to be beaten on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed in the Special against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday.
On Saturday on Quantaz, the Germans in the Kür were clearly ahead of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse, Quantaz, belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first freestyle.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago Werth had won all important four exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The Wormser Hochschule continues to go into the air: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" (DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung) provides a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy are equally utilized.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been studying Air Traffic Management as part of their training as an air traffic controller at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the piloting profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we are confident that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a forward-looking investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms University of Applied Sciences, also underlines this: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's programme Air Traffic Management".
The trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung is both a motivation and a commitment for Worm University to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future areas of aviation.
With the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study, the university could set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students in use for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, stresses: "With its focus on aviation, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg for about 30 minutes, as the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove straight ahead with a Ford at 12.40 p.m. at the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed at the guardrail.
Due to the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered slight injuries on the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient was subsequently flown to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed.
Heil wants to check other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
We're about to tighten up the law.
But are they right, and will they abide?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other sectors according to the now planned strict regulations against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against general restrictions on works contracts.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to adopt a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ outside personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of work contract workers and temporary workers should be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and employee leave if you do not want to completely strangle the economy".
For example, works contracts are the basis for the customer's added value for large areas of the craft industry, the construction industry and plant construction.
"The sins of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts anywhere in the German economy."
Works contracts are useful.
"If an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a safety facility, it is a normal contract of work."
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It is not possible to explain why, in future, different labour law should apply to portioning and packaging cheese than to sausages, according to an opinion on the draft law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 per cent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from works contractors worked in the industry for 16 hours a day according to the results of an examination by the NRW Employment Protection Administration.
Often they did not have a break.
Wage was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, they were bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now we have to clean up everything."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to adopt in the Cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates for occupational safety and health or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nunnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport," said nunmacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more controls would also require more human resources.
Three dead in the crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people died during the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
A child was slightly injured.
Two other people were saved injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel circuit control centre.
A parachute had been found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, on the basis of eyewitnesses, that before the crash, the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were initially not known.
eviction of Frankfurter Opernplatz to run peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the Opera Square in the night on Sunday went peacefully.
Most recently, a few dozen people stayed in the square, but left it at 1 a.m. before the curfew began.
The police had been in action with numerous officers since the early evening, and there was a larger police force in the entire city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on entering the Opera Square, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of those celebrating.
At least five officers were injured after police entry, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday had also remained calm.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in an accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered severe injuries on Sunday around 1:25 p.m.
She was taken to the Kassel Hospital.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade searched for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her place of residence Hümme, when her car came off the road from a previously unexplained cause and turned over several times.
In order to save the injured, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched by a thermal imaging camera from the rotary conductor.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for people.
However, the operatives did not find anyone between the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured were taken to the Kassel hospital for further care with the ambulance.
Almost 50 volunteers from the fire brigade Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The Bundesstraße was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champion in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world football player made the 36th Scudetto of the club's history perfect with a 2-0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home match against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1-0 before half time.
With 83 points, Turin, which took place two days before the end of the Serie A season, without Sami Khedira, who had been injured for a long time.
Inter Milan, the second in the league, is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in spite of optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a free kick variant.
The 35-year-old used a play by Miralem Pjanic from the penalty area border directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0 against the now more offensive guests, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
Thus, the bleak, but decisive success was assured.
The foulelfmeter at the latte in the 89th minute should have only Ronaldo himself with a view to the goal hunter classification correctly aggressed.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very slightly," said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve-Coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve had the final calming lead at the top of the table, mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo will also become the scorer king.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals in his account after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome in Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The current Juve pro Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the next title chance awaits the "Old Lady" of Italian football.
Juventus is in the eighth final of the Champions League, but has to make up for a 0:1 break on 7 August against Olympus Lyon in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court sentences, drivers continue to gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the speeders are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: In 2018 155 investigations were conducted in the public prosecutors' offices between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, a year later it was already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June as early as 151.
The races were less about organised events, as the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the state parliament SPD shows.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously competed against each other or they had taken flight from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
German men aged between 18 and 60 were the main drivers.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and trials of past years and reported more frequently, said one ministry spokesman.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Again and again motorists slow down traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier, there were even 18 riders on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular race track
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit there is an attempt to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between tights and vultures.
The mostly high-priced and topped up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers avoid to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country to the lawn.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would be able to overcome this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you weren't supposed to be legally here and there with 200 kilometres per hour and more on the road."
Rivoir holds less of information or image campaigns: "Whoever ignores all rules in such a way and puts not only his own life but also the life of other road users at risk, is hardly attainable with reason."
ADAC calls for greater police intervention
This is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the routes concerned.
Not infrequently, the high-touring mass of forces becomes more painful and serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men are said to have competed in a car race in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bounced against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
Twenty-one more people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
More severe penalties are not necessary, however, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "Legislative action is not seen in order to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder," says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Bluelight of July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
At about 3.40 a.m., a witness heard noises in the valley road and ran towards the snack.
There he noticed a man who served drinks at the fridge and then left the snack through a previously locked entrance door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to the police, the burglar also used cash at a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hoodie, black pants and bright shoes.
The police will receive further information from the Witnesses.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann has won his second day victory on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate from the Bora-hansgrohe team won a mass sprint on the 109-kilometer-long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt after winning a stage on Saturday.
It was the season victories three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had decided in the morning the mountain time riding sovereignly for himself and thus took over the top in the classment.
Only 104 riders had taken part in the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time trials.
"I'm really happy to start the season with a win," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish he simply put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
According to the rules of the World Association UCI, a Corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all race participants and their companions.
During the complete tour, drivers and supervisors were separated from the organisation team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Headquarter gave instructions for lay recreation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment house, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call arrived shortly before 1 p.m.
"A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay animation," said a firefighter to BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took over the revitalization measures a little later.
The child, who was in danger of life, was transported to the university hospital under reanimation.
Why it happened is unclear.
The police routinely started the investigation of the accident.
The fire officer: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized Tuning Meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and more than 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increase control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to Mittelfranken police, an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädter Straße had been detected by the Nuremberg traffic police at around 10.30 p.m.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up their efforts against so-called autoposers.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers counted at the top 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police account.
However, only a small part of those present were to be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
It appears that most of the scene followed the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly spectators.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the current infection protection regulations, in particular the adherence to the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-to-wet protection.
The on-the-spot checks were completed at around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found that the type-approval had lapsed for 10 vehicles with such structural changes.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No Car Races
Illegal car races did not exist.
"The police bureau of Mittelfranken will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out intensified control measures, also in connection with the rise of spectators," they said.
The agency News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They have all the beautiful rims, we must not scratch them", says Schrödinger.
Special ribbons would be used for this purpose.
Also because the cars are wider, the company has to be careful not to make any damage.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back safely."
Labour Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) investigates around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time workers' money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that reported short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, Executive Board Member responsible for operational business, of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a large number of companies had suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the test takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time at our disposal in this hot phase.
So we're going to take a closer look at the final statements.
I'm sure there'll be a lot of things to do.
We are not naive and have a long breath."
Evidence of abuse often comes from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be much more insolvency than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we arm ourselves in case of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money."
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden disbanded
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the Neues Garten.
The collection was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people would then have left the park.
On Saturday evening, some youths would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Time and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation there are always accumulations, in which the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19-transitional regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the Neues Garten.
Even without Corona, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties in Berlin have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party during the night to Sunday.
The event was disbanded by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist destination
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the regional authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still outstanding in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected young trainees are in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there," said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections had become public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the conduct of the interns who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have infected themselves there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of Corona spread throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In Austria, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured third place with a 2:0 (0:0) victory against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC was still passing by and qualified as fourth for the Royal League as well.
In the fight against the descent Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United was led by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the postseason, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) hit the final score.
Chelsea, opponent of FC Bayern in the Champions League final, won in parallel with 2-0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, which with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace passed the Wolves and started as sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the distance with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for themselves, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time to keep the class.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately rejected Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.

Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save himself through a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton FC.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team just missed the record in English football.
Manchester City holds the best mark with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the match on Sunday for Liverpool.
"It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," said goal scorer van Dijk after the game, "which should encourage us to defend the title.
It's gonna be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses are also likely to be satisfied.
Because of the Coronavirus crisis, football operations in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even an early demolition or a performance of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
After all, the season could be played without any special occurrences - however, as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against head of government Netanyahu are getting more and more violent.
During the night violent clashes took place.
The Israeli police violently attacked participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative leader Benjamin Netanyahu on the night of Sunday in Jerusalem.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld reported.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports, some 6000 people gathered near Netanyahu's headquarters on Saturday night.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's dealings with the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns, and called on Netanyahu to resign.
The news site "ynet" reported that participants in a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu had also been arrested.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu was also criticized for handling the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is confronted with rapid easing and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has seriously affected the country's economy.
The unemployment rate last stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel recently rose to ever new record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhr - Bild.de
Ahlen - On Saturday afternoon on the B58 at Ahlen, a driving accident claimed nine lightly injured.
A car driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "Suddenly she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn".
The driver of a Mercedes van driving behind her must have seen it too late.
He crawled on the back of the car.
In the accident, three occupants were injured in the car and six in the van.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea Locks Border City After Corona Suspected Case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "light success".
Now the country is reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspected case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, the state media reported that "the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country."
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency was imposed.
The Communist leadership issued the highest level of alarm.
If the suspicion is confirmed, it would be the first official infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has not yet reported a single infection and has described its defensive measures as a "lightening success".
The data were questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reported to have been detected by an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had left for South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four-kilometre wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
However, according to reports from the Yonhap National News Agency, South Korea’s military acknowledged the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations were carried out on some persons.
North Korea reportedly called for an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo chaired by Kim Jong Un on Saturday on the suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a fatal and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure, "to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "outlier case" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and impose severe punishment if necessary.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still to be discussed before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committee will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale urban development project East," it says in passing in the middle of the urban press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the large hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
However, the appreciation of the eastern city in particular is controversial until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently even hostile in individual committees, depending on their presence.
An appeal from the business community (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the administration and municipal council fail now after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "out of parliament opposition", "unsuspected", "speculation", "vilification" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the local council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city, the Technical City Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop in a very different way from what was predicted in the town hall and by the supporters of the economy.
Designing the city by its own power and not by an investor: that is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides essentially for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the open position of the Schloßberg, the rental of the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a small-scale inner-city redesign in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Transport Club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting regular bus traffic with thinned bars and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the re-fixing of parental contributions in the urban day care centres and the application for admission to the smart city support of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to take advantage of Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his first season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31st.
Before the league of the super sports cars can start the regular operation, the first test runs were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first mission in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargen made his first laps on the Lausitzring and got used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the preseason," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through the Lausitz.
But Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages, which you have to meet optimally in order to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann is then really, that turns out in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, do some poker during the tests," he says.
"Finally, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a busy calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formel-1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take part in the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister cold caught by Quarantine Resolution
According to press reports, the British government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Because of the rise in Corona numbers in Spain, the London Cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are only on leave on the deadline, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," said Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to let Grant Shapps know."
Nearly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the end of the severe curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists mainly blame nightlife for the recent spread.
Spain is one of the British's favourite holiday destinations.
The British Government currently advises against non-necessary travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular among British holidaymakers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for War Ships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on the day of the Navy in his country that he would equip the warships with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons, unique in the world, Russian naval forces would expand their capabilities to fight, Putin said in St. Petersburg on Sunday at the central naval parade.
The Ministry of Defence also informed Interfax about successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo will continue to be built
It was also said to be built on the atomicly utilising underwater torpedo Poseidon.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also sailed with a military boat himself, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service by the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal places the naval forces celebrated the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a show of weapons in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
Not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets, were featured in a video published by the Ministry of Defense.
Hurricane "Hanna" Reaches Texas: Help Difficult Due to Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season across the Atlantic has hit Texas land.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. climate agency NOAA reported in the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The Corona pandemic that is rampant in Texas complicates the work of the helpers, Abbott continued according to the U.S. media.
Evacuates called for caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," Abbott said, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
In view of the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is being exacerbated by the fact that it sweeps through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19."
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices "that we have become accustomed to", such as wearing masks, said the governor according to the CBS station.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, Corona was to be tested in emergency shelters.
Damage had initially only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning retracted
According to the authorities, "Hanna" was hit on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast at wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest stage one hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent a storm flood warning had first been issued and later taken back.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed towards northeast Mexico.
"Douglas" moves towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading towards Hawaii at night on Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometres per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
According to the prediction, it is supposed to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, a lower than average even ten percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump tweeted that his government was watching the storms closely and in contact with the states affected.
Four goals cancelled: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic were denied two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals missed: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raving black evening at the 0:2 (0:1) SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of ungiven gates for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so tough against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had gone through a goal of external defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute in the lead, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the balance.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back due to a side position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball again into the net - again the VAR intervened.
Also the goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) took back the referee team according to the VAR.
In the postseason Allan made the 2-0 final score for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology makes records", writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League started with a setback for double champion FC Bayern.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick, who has "somehow well" recovered, has to consider how he can rebuild his successful defenses after the injury of World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of duty behind Captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive king-class duels.
In Munich's Schmuddelwetter, the right-wing defender broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf cart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
The 24-year-old may hope for the final tournament, which starts in Lisbon on 12 August, to be played in the eight-elfinal back match against Chelsea FC on 8 August.
The Bavarians do not want to let themselves be stopped by the mishap from the training on Sunday.
Flick called in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be shown by his victorious title collectors in the 28 days following in the ideal case until the King Class Final on August 23rd.
"We have simply mastered the duties with championship and trophy excellently.
Now it's time to do something special," Flick said.
Until the Munich players can deal specifically with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve, however, the eight-elfinal challenge against Chelsea is now in place.
After the 3-0 in front of the Corona-Pause, the Londoners in the domestic arena were not to become the Bayern-Albtraum again as in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game," demanded Flick.
A match test will be held on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn in his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the Double, for a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players around Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the square for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the new ones, has been well inserted," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. can no longer just train, Flick would much rather talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the team is now trained in team strength for the Londoners, who are in the game rhythm in contrast to the Flick ensemble.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi; in the semi-finals, Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are potential opponents.
A way to the finale in Lisbon "is not that easy", emphasized the chief coach, who can trust in the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparation, what is particularly important with the 0 to 100 tuning.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" was an impressive trait of his team.
At the tournament with teams of nine, it was also ambitious on Sunday.
Of the performers, all were present, including Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not secured beyond the King Class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to ride on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise to award the World Cup titles.
However, all America races were cancelled.
Racing calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more racetracks were added to the ten Grand Prix that had been confirmed to date during the week.
The race will be held at the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão in Portugal in October.
On the first November Lewis Hamilton and Co. fight for World Cup points on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
This means that the 2020 racing calendar currently comprises 13 races.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the top class of motorsport will be completed in this exceptional season.
The Formula One team wants to finish their season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, before the races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, which have already been officially targeted, there could still be performances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulations demands races on three continents
However, the Formula 1 regulations require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the titles on the basis of "extraordinary circumstances" due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the approaching Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation meets criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," Carey explained.
The cancellation of the American races was particularly critical in Brazil: "The cancellation was not surprising for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in São Paulo was significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Moreover, the concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify a refusal.
They were prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest at Stephen Colbert's famous latenight show via video and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US latenight show via video.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the powerful in the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "evil look" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans in the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish woman.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children goes out on the street" she has experienced.
Heads of state and leading politicians who scoff at them in social media or even try to silence them, find them "funny" because they show the reactions "because they have no other answer".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the Actress sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip arose a GIF, i.e. an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the American president at that moment?
She replied briefly to Stephen Colbert's relatively open-ended question: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick answer and disappeared from the picture laughing for a short time.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder immobile with triple pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has best chances to become goal scorer king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB pro scored three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, among them two turned penalty in the post-seasons of both halves.
As a result, the 30-year-old from the fourth two season games before the end now has 34 season goals in his account - just as many were scored by Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply downhill and then slowly upwards again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members announced in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the group's profits to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with large crucifixes.
Mental problems are also said to have played a role.
Green left the band three years after it was founded in 1970.
A social descent followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He was said to have lived on the street for a while, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
At a young age, he became enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing professionally guitar and five years later got the chance to be a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
He was hired by the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green did not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac swam on a success wave without him in a new formation.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green didn't make a big comeback until he re-launched in 1996 with a group of friendly musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returning to Earth.
Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group, free of drugs, until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
