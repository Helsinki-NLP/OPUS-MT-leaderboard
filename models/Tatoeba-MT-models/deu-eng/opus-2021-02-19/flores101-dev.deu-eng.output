The former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich came second with 32 percent.
"As a state according to the "Winner takes all" principle, Florida gave all fifty electoral votes to Romney, and promoted him to the lead for the Republican Party nomination race."
Organisers of the protest said that around 100,000 people participated in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
In Berlin, the police estimated the number of demonstrators to be 6,500.
There were also protests in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valletta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
About 200 people protested in London in front of the offices of several major copyright holders.
Last month there were big protests in Poland when the country signed the ACTA, which led to the Polish government deciding not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Both Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the ACTA accession process.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are once again calling for surveillance cameras to be installed in all Australian slaughterhouses.
The chief inspector of RSPCA New South Wales, David O'Shannessy, told ABC that monitoring and inspections of abattoirs in Australia should be the order of the day.
""Video surveillance would certainly send a clear message to people working with animals that their well-being is most important.""
The International Earthquake Map of the US Geological Survey did not show any earthquakes in Iceland the week before.
The Icelandic Weather Service has also not detected any earthquake activity in the area around the Hekla in the last 48 hours.
The significant earthquake activity that led to the phase transition had taken place on 10 March on the northeast side of the summit crater of the volcano.
Dark clouds with no connection to any volcanic activity were reported at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds made it unclear whether there had been an outbreak.
"The "Luno" had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board when it got in distress and the strong winds and waves pushed them against the breakwaters."
The twelve crew members were rescued with helicopters and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-meter-long ship was on its way to pick up its usual cargo of fertilizers, and the authorities had originally feared that a cargo might leak.
The proposed addition was already approved by both boards in 2011.
There was a change in this legislature when the second sentence was removed from the House of Deputies and then passed by the Senate in a similar form on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes to ban same-sex registered partnerships, could potentially open the door to registered partnerships in the future.
Following the process, HJR-3 will be reviewed by the next elected legislator either in 2015 or 2016 in order to remain in the process.
Vautier's achievements away from filmmaking included a 1973 hunger strike against events that he regarded as political censorship.
French law was changed. His activism began in World War II when he was 15 years old and joined the French resistance.
He documented himself in a 1998 book.
In the 1960s, he went back to Algeria, which had just become independent, to teach directing.
The Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, twice Olympic gold medalist, died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was intrahepatic bile duct cancer.
He died on Tuesday in Osaka.
Saito was not only a former Olympic champion and world champion, but until his death also the chairman of the training committee of the All Japan Judo Association.
At least 100 people attended the ceremony to celebrate the first wedding day of a couple whose wedding took place last year.
A formal anniversary event was planned for a later date, officials said.
The couple had married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old husband, who was born in Buffalo, was one of four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who taught at the institutions of Modern Education and King's Glory and is said to have had 9000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents felt were corrupt, and in the classroom he allegedly used abusive words.
Modern education accused him of having large advertisements on buses without permission and of lying when he said he was the chairman of the English tutor.
He had already been accused of a copyright infringement, but had not been sued.
A former student said that he "used colloquial language in class, taught flirting techniques in comments, and was simply a student's buddy."
During the last three decades, China has developed a market economy, although it has officially remained a communist state.
First economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China’s economic power has increased by ninety times.
For the first time last year, China exported more cars than Germany and replaced the United States as the largest market for this industry.
China’s gross domestic product could surpass that of the United States in two decades.
Tropical storm Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic.
During the storm, about 3000 miles from Miami, Florida, maximum continuous winds of 40 mph (64 km/h) are measured.
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will rise to a hurricane by Wednesday.
Since the storm is still far from falling into the country, it is still difficult to estimate the possible effects on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, quickly became known while playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined the club in 1945 and remained there until 1958.
During his time in the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 games.
Nobody else has ever made more bets or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
He was named the best player in the history of Partizan in 1995.
The celebrations began with a special show by the world-famous group Cirque du Soleil.
It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janitscharenkapelle and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then rotating dervishes appeared.
The Turkish Diva Sezen Aksu performed with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and the Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
"Finally, the Turkish dance ensemble Feuer von Anatolien offered the performance ""Troja""."
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, died after being involved in an accident at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During his warm-up lap Lenz crashed off his motorcycle and was hit by his racing colleague Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately taken care of by the medical staff at the race track and sent to a local hospital where he later died.
Zayat was not injured in the accident.
Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero continued that “the financial system is a part of the economy, a vital part of life.
""We have a one-year financial crisis that has had its most intense time in the past two months and I think now the financial markets are starting to recover.""
Naked News announced last week that it would significantly expand its international mandate for reporting in foreign languages with three new programs.
The global organization, which already reports in English and Japanese, starts broadcasting programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, Internet and mobile devices.
“Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw gruesome scenes when people tried to break windows to get out.
People beat the glass panes with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
One of the windows finally broke and then they started to climb through the window," said the survivor Franciszek Kowal.
By the energy produced when hydrogen atoms are merged (or merged) to form heavier elements, stars emit light and heat.
Scientists are working to develop a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, this is an extremely difficult task, so it will take many years before actually usable fusion reactors are built.
Because of the surface tension, the steel needle floats on the water.
Surface tension arises because the water molecules at the water surface attract each other more strongly than they are attracted by the air molecules above.
The water molecules form an invisible layer on the water surface that allows objects such as the needle to float on the water.
The skid on a modern ice skate has a double edge with a concave indentation in between. The two edges allow a better hold on the ice, even if they are tilted.
Because the lower part of the blade is slightly curved, the edge that is in contact with the ice also bends when the blade tilts from one side to the other.
This turns the skater. When the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns to the right when the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they need to get rid of the additional energy they have received through the light.
They do so by emitting a tiny particle of light called 'photon'.
"Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because the atoms are stimulated by bright light and thereby a light photon leaks out, and light is a kind of radiation."
The next picture shows how the atoms emit photons. Of course, the photons are actually much smaller than on the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the stuff that atoms are made of!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament in the light bulb burns out at some point and the light bulb no longer works.
The bulb must then be replaced. It is necessary to be careful when changing the bulb.
First the switch of the lamp must be switched off or the cable connection must be interrupted.
The reason for this is that the current flowing into the holder for the metal part of the filament lamp can give you a strong current if you touch the inside of the holder or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partially in the holder.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart pumping the blood.
Blood flows away from the heart in vessels called arteries and returns to the heart in vessels called veins. The smallest vessels are called capillaries.
The teeth of a triceratops were able to crush not only leaves, but even very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists think that Triceratops ate palm ferns, a species of plant that was common in the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like small palm trees with a crown of sharp, sharp leaves.
A triceratops may have used its strong beak to remove the leaves before eating the stem.
Other scientists argue that these plants were very toxic and therefore probably no dinosaur would have eaten them, although today the sloth and other animals, e.g. parrots (which stem from the dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves and fruits.
How would the gravity of Io affect me? If you were on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So, of course, gravity attracts less on one.
Unlike Earth, the sun does not have a crust on which to stand. The entire sun consists of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas gets thinner the further away from the center of the sun.
"The outer area we see when we look into the sun is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope and observed that Venus, just like the moon, had phases.
Phases occur because only the side of Venus (or the Moon) facing the Sun is illuminated. The phases of Venus support the theory of Copernicus that the planets orbit around the Sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England had experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of Danelag.
In 991, however, Ethelred faced a Viking fleet larger than any other fleet since Guthrum a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with the ambition to regain his country from Danish rule.
After initial military setbacks, Æthelred was able to agree with Olaf on conditions. The latter returned to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with changeful success.
Hangeul is the only deliberately invented alphabet that is used daily by many people today. The alphabet was invented in 1444, during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and is one of the most revered.
Originally, he called the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the right sounds for the instruction of the people".
There are many theories about the origins of Sanskrit. One of them is about the immigration of the Aryans from the West to India, who brought their language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the collection of Upanishads, the Sanskrit left for hierarchical reasons.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that served as a source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the battle for France was over, Germany prepared for the invasion of the British island.
Germany gave the attack the alias "Company Sea Lion". Most of the heavy weapons and supplies of the British army had been lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, so the army was weakened.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("War Navy") and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were stationed near the probable invasion routes, as the admirals feared that they could be sunk in a German air raid.
Let us begin with an explanation of the Italian plans. Italy was primarily the 'little brother' of Germany and Japan.
It had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although only shortly before the beginning of the war four new ships had been built.
The main objectives of Italy were African countries. In order to conquer these countries, they needed a starting point for the troops to sail across the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
For this they had to eliminate British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from that Italy's battleships should not have any further role.
Now to Japan. Japan was an island state, just like Great Britain.
Submarines are ships intended to sail underwater and stay there for a longer period of time.
Submarines were used during World War I and World War II. At that time they were very slow and had a very limited range of shots.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly moved at the surface of the sea, but as the radar developed and became more and more precise, the submarines were forced to dive to avoid being seen.
The word submarine was also used in English in the "U-Boat" version, which meant German submarines in particular. The Germans were very good at navigating and controlling their submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, the Germans were not trusted to own many of them after the war.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "The Boy King", is today one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings.
Interestingly, it was not considered very important in ancient times and was not listed on the oldest royal lists.
However, the discovery of his burial chamber in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many ancient tombs were robbed, his grave remained almost untouched.
Most of the objects with which Tutankhamun was buried are well preserved, as are thousands of artifacts made from valuable metals and rare stones.
The invention of the spoke wheel made the Assyrian chariots easier, faster and better able to overtake soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows could pierce the armor of enemy soldiers. About 1000 BC, the Assyrians introduced the cavalry.
A cavalry is a force that fights on horses. Since the saddle was not invented yet, the Assyrian cavalry fought from the bare back of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous person of this cultural circle is the legendary blind poet Homer, who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: the "Iliad" and the "Odyssee".
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights, and their plays are among the greatest works in world literature.
Another well-known Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, who is mainly known for his famous teaching on the side ratios of right-angled triangles.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated that Hindi is the second to fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether very closely related dialects are counted or not.
Estimates range from 340 to 500 million speakers. Up to 800 million people understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have a similar vocabulary, but a different script; in everyday conversation speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under great cultural influence from Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native people and thus developed the Estonian written language.
It was based on the German alphabet and a letter, 'Õ/õ', was added.
Over time, many words that had been borrowed from the German merged. That was the beginning of the Enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne went directly to the military after the end of school.
Charles then studied Anthropology and Archaeology, later also History, at Trinity College in Cambridge and graduated with 2:2 (a degree without special distinction).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive a university degree.
The European part of Turkey (East Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) covers 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey with a length of more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) and a width of 800 kilometers (500 miles) resembles a rectangle in its shape.
The territory of Turkey, including the lakes, covers 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) are in South West Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
The area of Turkey makes it the 37th largest country in the world and it is about as large as the European part of France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded on three sides by seas – the Aegean Sea in the west, the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean Sea in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but has only been independent since 1839.
Today's parts of Belgium belonged to Luxembourg in the past, but after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s became part of Belgium.
Although Luxembourg had always tried to remain a neutral country, it was occupied by Germany in both the First and Second World Wars.
Luxembourg became a founding member of the organisation, which is now known as the European Union, in 1957.
The Drukyel Dzong is a fortress and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro District (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress in 1649 to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
In 1951, a fire caused only a few remains of the Drukyel Dzong to survive, including the image of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected and remains one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.
During the 18th century, Cambodia was constrained between two powerful neighbors – Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in the last years of the 18th century.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed and most employees work in the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelans work in services, almost one quarter in industry and one fifth in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for the Venezuelans. Although only one percent of the workforce is employed in the oil industry, the country is a net exporter here.
Early in the nation's independence, the expertise of the Singapore Botanical Garden helped transform the island into a tropical garden city.
Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid cross, was named the national flower of the country in 1981.
Every year around October almost 1.5 million herbivores move to the southern plains and cross the Mara River from the northern hills because of the rains.
And then back to the north through the west, with another crossing of the river Mara after the rains in April.
The Serengeti area includes Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Reserve and Maswe Wild Park in Tanzania, and Maasai Mara National Park in Kenya.
To learn how to create interactive media, conventional and traditional skills and tools are required that are learned in interactive courses (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to question your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
An interactive design requires that the components of a project connect together, but that they also make sense as independent units.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focus and number of lens elements required for a focal length range are much greater than for fixed focal length lenses.
This problem is becoming more and more insignificant as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
This made it possible to create images with zoom lenses in a quality comparable to those of lenses with a fixed focal length.
Another disadvantage of telephoto lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually lower.
Therefore, cheap zoom lenses are difficult to use in situations with little light without flash.
One of the most common problems with converting a movie into the DVD format is over scanning.
Most television sets are manufactured in such a way that they please the general public.
That's why everything you see on the TV is cut off from the top, bottom and sides of the edge.
This is to ensure that the image covers the whole screen, which is called an overscan.
Unfortunately, the edges are also probably cut off when you make a DVD, and if the subtitles are too close to the bottom in the video, they are not fully displayed.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination and conjures up images of tournaments, banquets and Arthurian knighthood.
Even standing between a thousand years old ruins, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of long ago battles, to almost hear the hoofing on the cobblestone and to smell the growing fear in the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
As was typical of the time, Kirby Muxloe Castle is a fortified house rather than a real castle.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls could not have resisted a targeted attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began to build it, the country was quite peaceful and defence was only necessary against small gangs of marauders.
The balance of power was a system in which the European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states,
The concept was that all European nations had to try to prevent a nation from becoming powerful, so national governments changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The Spanish War of Succession is the first war whose main problem was the balance of power.
This marked an important change since the European powers could no longer use the pretext of fighting religious wars. Therefore, the Thirty Years' War was the last war to be labeled religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 BC in an act of arson by Herostratus.
According to history, his motivation was in glory at all costs. The angry Ephesians declared that Herostratos' name would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later wrote down the name, which is why we know it today. The temple was destroyed the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander as king asked to pay for a new building of the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure that your hand is as relaxed as possible and yet you can hit all the sounds correctly. Also try not to make unnecessary large movements with your fingers.
This will make you tired as little as possible. Remember that it is not necessary to hit the keys with much force to achieve additional volume, as is the case with the piano.
To increase the volume on the accordion, use the bellows with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the pursuit of community, identity, or conscious mindfulness in relation to an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer strives for a direct experience, intuition or insight into divine reality/deity or deities.
The followers pursue certain ways of life or practices which are intended to promote such experiences.
Mysticism differs from other forms of religious faith and worship in that the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness is in the foreground. This applies especially to those forms with a peaceful, insightful, blissful or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the 15th century in Pandjab from a separation of Hinduism.
Sikhs regard their faith as a religion independent of Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means "way of gurus". The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has taken on a meaning that is the core of Sikh faith.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539) and followed by another nine gurus.
In June 1956, however, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland, where workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, developed into a general protest against communism.
Although Krushchev finally sent tanks to restore order, he gave in to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Vladyslav Gomulka as new Prime Minister.
The Indus Valley civilization is a Bronze Age civilization in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, which comprised most of present-day Pakistan and some regions in northwest India and northeast Afghanistan.
This civilization flourished in the basin of the Indus, from which its name is derived.
Although some scholars believe that civilization should be called an Indus-Sarasvati civilization, because it also existed in the basins of the now dried-out Sarasvati River, while others call it a Harappan civilization – to Harappa, the first of its sites excavated in the 1920s.
The military nature of the Roman Empire helped to develop medical progress.
Doctors were recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman medical force to be deployed after battles.
The Roman surgeons knew several tranquilizers, including morphine from poppy seeds and scopolamine from the seeds of nightshade plants.
They controlled amputations to save patients from wound burn, as well as pressure bands and arterial clamps to control blood flow.
Over several centuries, the Roman Empire made great advances in medicine and formed much of our knowledge today.
Pureland Origami is origami with the restriction that it is only possible to fold once. More complex folds such as reverse folding are not allowed and all folds have simple positions.
It was developed in the 1970s by John Smith to help people who are inexperienced in folding or have limited motor skills.
Children develop a racial consciousness and race stereotypes quite early and these race stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify with an ethnic minority, who are said to be not doing well at school, tend to be bad at school as soon as they become aware of the stereotype associated with their ethnicity.
MySpace is the third most popular site in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have caused a lot of interest, especially in the education sector.
There are positive aspects of these websites, including the ability to easily set up a class page that can contain blogs, videos, photos and other features.
This page can easily be accessed by simply providing a web address. This makes it easy for students who may have problems using the keyboard or spelling to remember it and type it in.
It can be adapted to make it easy to read, and also with as much or as little color as desired.
The attention deficit syndrome "is a neurological syndrome whose classically descriptive symptom trio includes impulsiveness, deflection and hyperactivity or excess energy."
"It's not a learning disability, it's a learning weakness; it "affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, maybe a total of 2 million American children."
Children with ADHD have difficulty concentrating on things like schoolwork, but they can focus on things they enjoy, such as playing, watching their favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble because they "have a risky behavior, get into fights and challenge authorities" to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
ADHD interferes with relationships with peers because other children cannot understand why they behave in such a way, why they spell or why their degree of maturity is different.
As the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn changed as described above, the basic rate of knowledge acquisition also changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. The pressure was no longer in the individual memory. Rather, the ability to remember texts became more central.
In essence, the Renaissance brought about a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to carry loads or to swing through trees.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee are of similar size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to load the weight of the ankle.
In humans, the hand is shorter than the foot, with the phalanges being straighter.
Petrified hand bones, the age of which is two to three million years, show this change in the specialization of the hand from the means of transport to the gripping tool.
Some people believe that the experience of many artificially generated lucid dreams can often be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that the clear dreams lead to longer time intervals between the REM phases.
With fewer REM phases per night, the state in which you experience real sleep and your body recovers will be so rare that it becomes a problem.
This is just as exhausting as waking up and watching TV every twenty or thirty minutes.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream of lucid per night.
It was almost bad for the Italians in North Africa from the very beginning. Within a week of Italy’s declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the 11th Hussar regiment of the British had taken Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an attack in the east of Bardia, the British seized the chief engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.
On 28 June, Marshall Italo Balbo, the governor-general of Libya and suspected successor to Mussolini, was accidentally killed by fire from his own troops while he landed in Tobruk.
Modern fencing sports are practiced on many levels, from university students to professional and Olympic competitions.
The sport is primarily performed as a duel by one fencer fighting with another.
Golf is a game where players use clubs to transport balls into holes.
During an ordinary round, eighteen holes are played, whereby players usually start at the first hole of the course and stop at the eighteenth.
The player who needs the least strokes or swings with the racket to complete the course wins.
The game is played on a lawn. The grass around the hole is mowed shorter and referred to as the green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
This is the case when people go to a place that is very different from their normal everyday life to relax and enjoy.
Beaches, amusement parks and campsites are among the places most visited by leisure tourists.
If the aim of visiting a particular place is to experience its history and culture, then this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different attractions in a country, or they can simply choose to focus on just one region.
The colonists had also called for reinforcement when they observed this activity.
Among the troops that strengthened the advanced defense positions were the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiment with 200 men under the Colonels John Stark and James Reed (who later became both generals).
Strong men lined up along the fence at the north end of the position of the colonists.
When the low tide created a gap along the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence northward with a short stone wall that ended on a small beach on the edge of the water.
Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one should fire before the regular soldiers had run past it.
The American plan relied on the implementation of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder conducted a diversionary attack on the British garrison in Bordentown to block any other troops.
General James Ewing would lead 700 militias across the river near Trenton Ferry, take the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent all enemy troops from escaping.
The main attack force of 2,400 men was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
By changing from a quarter-mile to a half-mile race, the pace is far less important and endurance is an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class 800 m runner who runs under two minutes must be fast, but in any case, endurance must be trained.
Some cross-country skiing in winter combined with a training of the upper body in the sports hall is the best preparation for the running season.
Good nutrition alone does not guarantee top performance, but it significantly improves the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, effective drinking habits and understanding the various aspects of taking supplements can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of sports.
Middle distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport, but there are many misunderstandings about the few equipment you need for it.
The products can be purchased as needed, but most will have little or no real impact on performance.
Athletes can be of the opinion to prefer a product, even if it does not offer any real benefits.
The atom can be regarded as one of the fundamental building blocks of any matter.
It is a very complex unit that, according to a simplified drilling model, consists of a central core orbited by electrons, similar to the Sun of the planets – see Figure 1.1.
The atomic nucleus consists of two particles – neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge, while neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electric charge.
To check the opera, you first need to get an overview of the scene in order to guarantee your safety.
You must observe the position of the victim as you approach it, as well as all automatic warning signs.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that depression, anxiety and disaster thinking in witch-shooting patients has an effect on the combination of pain and activity restriction.
Only the effects of catastrophy, but not depression and anxiety were prerequisites for regular weekly structured sessions with physical activities.
Those who participated in regular activities needed more support in terms of negative pain perception when it came to distinguishing chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical exercise.
Vision, i.e. the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or the eyes.
Eyes can be built in many ways, the complexity of which differs from the requirements of the life form.
The different constructions have different abilities, are receptive to different wavelengths and have different visual acuity. In addition, they require different ways of processing the recorded to a meaningful impression, and the number of eyes associated with the respective design type, which is necessary for optimal radiation, is different.
A population is the collection of organisms of a particular species within a given geographical area.
If all individuals of a population are alike in relation to a particular phenotypic characteristic, then they are called monomorphic.
If the individuals have different variations of a certain property, then they are polymorphic.
Ant peoples also march and nest in different phases.
In the nomadic phase hiking ants march at night and rest during the day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when the available food has declined. During this phase, the colony builds temporary nests that are changed daily.
Each of these nomadic parades or marches takes about 17 days.
"What is a cell? The word cell originates from the Latin word "cella", which means "small space" and was coined for the first time by a microscopician who observed the structure of cork."
The cell is the basic unit of all living beings and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
In the study of life, cells are regarded as so fundamental and crucial that they are often referred to as building blocks of life.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to keep the flow of blood in motion.
These nerve impulses can be sent very quickly through the entire body to protect it from a potential threat.
In comparison to other violent storms, tornadoes hit a rather small area, but they can destroy everything that stands in their way.
Tornadoes uproot trees, tear boards of buildings and hurl cars through the air. The strongest 2 percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.
These monster storms have winds reaching speeds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 MPH).
People have been producing and using magnifying lenses for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were built in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always accompany us and it is in the nature of cooperation that there is more and more selfish behavior to win as long as the majority benefits.
It remains to be hoped that most people realize that their best option in the long term is to work with others.
Many people dream of the day when people can travel to other stars and explore other worlds. Some people are concerned about what is out there. Some believe that aliens or other life forms could exist on other planets.
But if this ever happens, it will take a long time to get there, and the stars are so scattered that even between "neighbour-stars" there are trillions of kilometres.
Perhaps one day your great-grandsons will stand at the top of an alien world wondering who their ancestors were?
Animals consist of numerous cells. They eat things and digest them inside. Most animals can move.
Only the animals have a brain (even if not all animals have one; jellyfish, for example, do not have one).
Animals can be found all over the earth. They dig through the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the air.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella, which means small space.
When you look at living beings under a microscope, you will see that they consist of smaller squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, discovered small squares in the cork under the microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and connections can move from one state to another and not change.
Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules are the same.
Water is another example. The compound water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it is gaseous, liquid or solid.
Although its state may change, the chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that surrounds us everywhere and influences everything we do, yet it is difficult to understand.
Time has been researched by religious, philosophical and scientific thinkers for millennia.
We experience time as a sequence of events that run from the future through the present into the past.
Time is also the way we compare the duration (length) of events.
One can mark the passing of time itself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that takes place regularly.
Computers are used nowadays to manipulate images and videos.
Demanding animations can be constructed on the computer and are increasingly used in television and films.
Music is often recorded with the help of sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds.
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, long Zait was thought that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maoris, who hunted Moa called giant birds.
The theory then led to the idea that the Maoris migrated from Polynesia with a large fleet, taking away New Zealand's Moriori and thus founding an agricultural-based society.
New evidence suggests, however, that the Moriori were a group of Maori from the mainland who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their own peaceful culture there.
There was another tribe in the Chatham Islands, Maori, who left New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, came to some skirmishes and in the end the Moriori were destroyed.
Individuals who have been involved for several decades helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions, while difficulties and even failures were honestly evaluated.
By listening to individuals who have shared their personal, family and organizational stories, we have gained valuable insights into the past and some personalities who have influenced the culture of the organization for both good and bad.
The understanding of one's own history does not require an understanding of culture, but it at least helps people to get a sense of where they stand in the history of the organization.
As they evaluate the achievements and notice the failures, individuals and all participants as a whole become more aware of the values, mission and driving forces of the organization.
In this case, the memory of earlier cases of entrepreneurial behaviour and the resulting successes helped people to be open to changes and a new orientation of the parish.
Success stories such as these reduced the fear of change and at the same time created a positive attitude towards coming changes.
Convergent thought patterns are methods of problem solving that bring together different ideas or areas to find a solution.
In this way of thinking, the focus is on speed, logic and accuracy, also on the identification of facts, the re-application of existing techniques, the collection of information.
The most important factor in this attitude is: There is only one correct answer. You think of only two possible answers, right or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this way of thinking think logically, can memorize patterns, solve problems and process scientific tests.
People are by far the most gifted way of reading the thoughts of others.
This means that we are able to correctly assess what other people perceive, intend, think, know or want to do.
In addition to these abilities, it is crucial to understand the intentions of others. It enables us to eliminate possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you see someone smashing a car window, you'd probably assume he's trying to steal a stranger's car.
He would have to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car he was trying to break into.
MR is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (KMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).
With this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to emit tiny radio signals.
In 1970, the physician and researcher Raymond Damadian discovered the basis for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic aid.
Four years later, a patent was granted which was the world's first patent in the field of MRI.
"In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first ""whole body"" MRI scanner, which he called the ""invincible""."
Asynchronous communication gives time for reflection and reaction to others.
It allows students to work at their own pace and to control the pace of dealing with the teaching content.
In addition, there are less time constraints and the possibility of working at flexible times. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to have access to information at any time.
Students can also ask the lecturers questions at any time of the day and expect relatively fast answers instead of waiting until the next personal meeting.
The postmodern approach of learning offers the freedom of absolute. There is not only a good way to learn.
In fact, there is not a good thing to learn. Learning takes place in the experience between the learner and the knowledge offered.
Our current experience with the many television programmes that deal with do-it-yourself approaches, information sharing and learning underlines this observation.
So many of us get caught watching a television show that informs us about a process or experience, even though we will never participate in it or use that knowledge.
We will never overtake a car, build a well in our backyard, travel to Peru to investigate ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbor's house.
Greenland is well networked and 93% of the population has Internet access thanks to underwater fiber optic connections to Europe and broadband satellites.
Your hotel or host (if you are staying in an inn or a private apartment) is likely to have Wi-Fi or a PC connected to the Internet. In addition, all settlements have an internet café or a place with publicly accessible Wi-Fi.
"As mentioned above, although the word "Eskimo" is still acceptable in the United States, it is considered derogatory by many Arctic peoples outside the United States, especially in Canada."
You may hear this word from the natives of Greenland, but foreigners should avoid it.
The natives of Greenland call themselves in Canada Inuit and in Greenland Kalaalleq (multiple Kalaallit), i.e. Greenland.
Crime and displeasure towards foreigners in general are virtually unknown in Greenland. Even in the cities there are no 'problem zones'.
Cold weather may be the only real danger the unprepared could face.
If you visit Greenland in a cold season (if you consider that the colder the further north you travel), it is essential to bring along clothes that are warm enough.
The very long summer days can lead to inadequate sleep and associated health problems.
Also pay attention to the Nordic mosquitoes during the summer. Even if they do not transmit diseases, they are very annoying.
Although San Francisco's economy is linked to the fact that the city is a world-class tourist attraction, it is nevertheless diversified.
The largest areas of employment are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
Their frequent representation in music, films, literature and pop culture has helped to make the city and its landmarks known all over the world.
San Francisco has built a comprehensive tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and first-class convention facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the country's best places for other Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
A trip to Walt Disney World is a great pilgrimage for many American families.
The "typical" visit includes the flight trip to Orlando International Airport, then the bus trip to a Disney hotel on the premises, then a stay there for about weeks without leaving the Disney area, and then the journey home.
"There are countless variations possible, but this is what most people mean when they speak of a "journey to Disney World."
Many tickets that are sold online via auction websites such as eBay or Craigslist are already partially used multi-day park hopper tickets.
This is very often handled this way, but is forbidden by Disney: The tickets are not transferable.
To camp below the edge of the Grand Canyon, a permit is required for the hinterland.
Licenses are limited to protect the canyon and are available from the first of the month, four months before the start month.
Thus, on 1 January, a permit for the hinterland is available for any starting date in May.
The place for the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel Campground next to the Phantom Ranch, is usually filled by those requests that are received on the first day when reservations are possible for them.
There are a limited number of permits reserved for occasional requests which are awarded on the basis of the principle of 'first come, first served'.
Entering southern Africa by car is an amazing way to see all the beauty of the region and get to places away from normal tourist routes.
This can be done with careful planning in a normal car. However, an all-wheel drive is strongly recommended, as many places can only be reached with all-wheel drive and high wheelbase.
When planning, remember that the south of Africa is stable, but the neighbouring countries are not always.
Visa requirements and costs vary with each country and depend on the country you come from.
Each country also has specific laws that specify which items must be in the car for emergencies.
Victoria Falls is a city in the western part of Zimbabwe, on the other side of the Livingstone, Zambia border, and near Botswana.
The city is right next to the waterfalls and they are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers both adventurers and tourists, numerous opportunities for a longer stay.
In the rainy season (November to March) the amount of water will be higher and the cases will be more dramatic.
You can safely assume that you will get wet if you cross the bridge or use the winding paths that lead along the waterfalls.
On the other hand, because of the high water volume, your view of the actual waterfall is concealed – through all the water!
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 is probably the most famous tomb in the valley. The tomb of the young king was discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter in almost intact condition.
Compared to most other royal tombs, however, the tomb of Tutankhamun is hardly worth a visit, as it is much smaller and has few decorations.
Anyone interested in seeing evidence of the damage inflicted on the mummy during the removal attempts from the coffin will be disappointed, as only the head and shoulders are visible.
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer in it, but were brought to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors who have limited time should prefer to spend them elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This temple on a hill was built at the end of the 9th century during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view over the Tonle Sap lake are worth climbing the hill.
A visit to the sight can be easily connected with a boat trip on the lake.
The Angkor pass is required to enter the temple. Therefore, do not forget to take your passport with you when you travel to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is Israel’s capital and largest city, but most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize the city as Israel’s capital.
The ancient city on the hills of Judea has a fascinating history that spans thousands of years.
The city is considered sacred in the three monotheistic religions – Judaism, Christianity and Islam – and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural centre.
In view of the religious importance of the city and especially due to the many attractions within the old town, Jerusalem is one of Israel's most important tourist destinations.
Jerusalem offers many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, as well as dynamic and lively shopping centers, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive an invitation letter before entering Ecuador via international airports or border crossing points.
This letter must be declared legal by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and meet certain requirements.
These requirements are designed to ensure a regulated migration flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens who hold a U.S. Green Card should visit an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from this condition.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the period of your trip. A return or re-flight ticket is required to prove the length of your stay.
Tours are cheaper for larger groups. If you are travelling alone or just with a friend or friend, then you should get together with others and try to form a group of four to six people to get a cheaper price for the individual.
But you should not worry about it, because tourists are often grouped together to make the vehicles full.
It seems more like a trick to make people think they have to pay more.
High above the northern edge of Machu Picchu, this steep mountain is often the backdrop of many photos of the ruins.
From below it looks a bit discouraging and it is a steep and difficult climb, but most reasonably fit people should be able to cope with it in about 45 minutes.
Most of the way is covered with stone steps, and in the steeper sections steel ropes form a supporting railing.
However, count on being out of breath and be careful in the steeper sections, especially when it is wet, as it can quickly become dangerous there.
Near the summit is a tiny cave, which is quite low and very narrow.
The sights and wildlife of the Galapagos Islands are best visited by boat, as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships are sailing in the waters around the Galapagos Islands – the size of which can range from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their place long in advance (as the boats are usually full during the high season).
Make sure that you book through an intermediary specializing in the Galapagos Islands who knows well about a wide range of ships.
This way you can make sure that the ship fits best with your special wishes and/or limitations.
Before the Spaniards reached Chile in the 16th century, the north of the country was under the rule of the Inca, while the middle and south of the country were inhabited by the native Araucanians (Mapuche).
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent indigenous groups in America that were not fully absorbed into Spanish-speaking rule until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, through which Spain had no functioning central government for several years), the final victory could not be achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a country in the Caribbean that covers the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is also home to the oldest European city in America, which today belongs to Santo Domingo.
The island was originally inhabited by the Taíno and Caribs. The Caribbean spoke Araucan and arrived there about 10,000 years BC.
Within a few years of the arrival of the European explorers, the population of the Taino had experienced a significant population decline by the Spanish conquistadors.
After Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 Taínos between 1492 and 1498.
Jardín de la Unión. This complex was built as an atrium for a 17th century monastery, the only building of which is the Templo de San Diego.
Now it serves as a central place where numerous events take place day and night.
There are numerous restaurants in the vicinity of the garden, where afternoon and evening often free concerts take place in the central pavilion.
Callejon del Beso (Kussegasse). Two balconies, only 69 cm away, are the place of an old love story.
For some change, a couple of kids will tell you about the story.
Bowen Island is a popular day or weekend trip with kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants and much more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound, near Vancouver and is easily reached by regular water taxis departing from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who like to be active outdoors, a hike up to the Sea-to-Sky Corridor is essential.
Whistler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but very well known due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Enjoy the winter at some of the top ski resorts in North America, and during the summer you should try real mountain biking.
Permits must be ordered in advance. You need a permit to stay in La Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station that offers tents, dormitory accommodation and hot meals. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer self catering camping.
It is possible to get a parking license directly at the ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards
The Park Administration (MINAE) issues permits for the park not earlier than one month before the planned arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for a fee of 30 US dollars or 10 US dollars for day tickets. Details can be found on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands are an island state that is freely associated with New Zealand, and they are located in Polynesia in the middle of the South Pacific.
It is an archipelago with 15 islands that spread over 2.2 million square kilometers of ocean surface.
With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes referred to as "Hawaii Down Under".
Although smaller, it reminds some older visitors of Hawaii before it became a state, without all the big tourist hotels and other development.
The Cook Islands do not have cities, but consist of 15 different islands. The most important ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In developed countries, the offering of luxury guest houses has now become a kind of art form.
At the top of the scale, of course, the B&Bs compete for two main points: bed and breakfast.
Therefore, one can find the most opulent bedding, possibly a hand-made duvet or an antique bed frame at the best of these accommodations.
At breakfast there can be seasonal delicacies of the region or the special dish of the host.
The frame can be a historic old building with an antique equipment, a beautifully prepared area and a swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and going on a long journey has an immanent attraction due to its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you are probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limits.
Setting up a tent on a private property or in any large city can quickly lead to undesirable reactions.
In short, using your own car is a great option for a road trip, but not for camping.
Camping with a car is an option if you have a spacious minivan, SUV, limousine or combined car with folding seats.
The heritage of some hotels dates back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners, the period before the Second World War, the 19th or early 20th century.
In these hotels, the rich and famous of their time used to stay and enjoy good food and nightlife.
The ancient facilities, the absence of modern conveniences and a certain elegant ageing also make up their character.
Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes host heads of state and other dignitaries who are visiting.
Very wealthy travelers could opt for a flight trip around the world that alternates with visits to many of these hotels.
A so-called Hospitality Exchange Network is the organization that brings travelers in the cities they visit with locals.
To join such a network usually only requires filling out an online form; although some networks offer or require additional checks.
A list of available accommodations is now available either printed out or made available online. It sometimes includes recommendations and reports from other travellers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 because the computer programmer Casey Fenton had found a cheap flight for a trip to Iceland, but no overnight stay.
He sent e-mails to students of the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers for free accommodation.
Hostels are aimed primarily at young people – a typical guest is in his twenties – but you often find older travelers there.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels allow their accommodation in private rooms.
Beijing City in China will host the Winter Olympics in 2022, making it the first city to host both the summer and winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremony as well as the hall ice events.
Other ski events take place at the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples have an annual feast between the end of November and mid-May, which varies according to the annual calendar of the respective temple.
Most temple festivals are celebrated in the context of the temple anniversary, the birthday of the supreme deity or other important events related to the temple.
The temple festivals in Kerala decorated with regular parades of elephants, temple orchestra and other festivities are very interesting to observe,
A world exhibition (often called the Expo) is a major international festival of arts and sciences.
Participating countries exhibit artistic and educational exhibits in national pavilions to present global concerns or the culture and history of each country.
International horticultural exhibitions are special events in which flower shows, botanical gardens and everything else related to plants are presented.
Although theoretically they can take place annually (as long as they are in different countries), this is different in practice.
These events usually last for three to six months and are held in places covering at least 50 hectares.
Over the years, many different film formats have been used. The normal 35 mm film (negative with dimensions of 36 x 24 mm) is most common.
It can usually be used quite simply when you run out of it, and it has a resolution roughly equivalent to that of current digital SLR cameras.
Some medium format film cameras use a format of 6 x 6 cm, more precisely a 56 x 56 mm negative.
This results in an almost four times higher resolution than a 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 compared to 864).
The wildlife is one of the most difficult motives for a photographer. For this type of photography you need both luck and patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photography is often accepted as given, but as with other photography, one image says more than a thousand words.
Wildlife photography often requires long telephoto lenses, although other lenses are required for motifs such as a flock of birds or a small creature.
Many exotic animals are difficult to discover and in some parks there are rules for taking photographs for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be either shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
There are over 5,000 different languages in the world, including more than twenty with 50 million or more speakers.
Written words are often easier to understand than spoken words. This is especially true for addresses where a clear pronunciation is often difficult.
Many nations speak fluent English, and in even more countries you can expect limited knowledge of English, especially among younger people.
Imagine a person from Manchester, one from Boston, one from Jamaica and one from Sydney sitting together for dinner at a restaurant in Toronto.
They delight each other in telling stories from their home cities, presented in their pronounced accents and local jargons.
Buying food in the supermarket is usually the cheapest way to get fed up. However, without cooking facilities, the selection is limited to ready-made dishes.
Supermarkets are getting an increasing variety of ready meals. Some even offer microwaves and other methods to warm up the food.
In some countries or shops there is at least one restaurant on site, which is often more casual and affordable.
Make copies of your policy and the contact details of your insurer and carry them with you.
For consultations/authorisations and applications, they must provide the insurer's e-mail address and international telephone numbers.
Keep another copy in your luggage and online (e-mail to yourself with attachment or stored in the "Cloud").
If you are travelling with a laptop or tablet, make a copy in memory or on the hard drive (which is available without internet).
Provide copies of the insurance/contact details also to fellow travellers and relatives or friends at home who are willing to help.
Moose are not aggressive by nature, but defend themselves when they perceive a threat.
People who do not regard the moose as a potential threat can come too close to it and put themselves in danger.
Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently and it is very important to know your own limit.
Possible long-term health problems due to excessive alcohol consumption may include liver damage and even blindness and death. The potential risk is increased by the consumption of illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal spirits may contain various dangerous impurities, including methanol, which can lead to blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses can be cheaper in other countries, especially in low-income countries where wage costs are lower.
Consider taking an eye examination in your home country, especially if it is covered by the insurance, and then redeeming the prescription in another country.
High-quality brand versions available in such areas can have two problems - some may be counterfeits, the real ones imported may be more expensive than in their own country.
Coffee is one of the world's most traded goods and you can probably find many different varieties in your home region.
Nevertheless, there are many different ways of drinking coffee around the world that you should experience.
Canyoning (also known as ravines) is about getting into the bottom of a ravine that is either dry or full of water.
Elements of canyoning are swimming, climbing and jumping – but it has relatively low demands on training and physical condition for beginners (for example, in comparison to rock climbing, sport diving and alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that consists of walking in nature, often on hiking trails.
Daily hikes include distances from less than a mile to longer distances that can be travelled in a single day.
For a day hike on a simple route it does not take much preparation and anyone who is reasonably fit can enjoy it.
Families with small children may need more preparation, but an outdoor day can also be done with babies and preschool children.
There are almost 200 running tour organizations worldwide. Most work independently.
Go Running Tours, the successor to Global Running Tours, connects dozens of Sight Running providers across four continents.
With roots in Barcelona's Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen, it quickly gained growth through Running Tours Prague in Prague and others.
There are many things you need to consider before and during a trip.
Don't expect things to be exactly like "home" when you travel, manners, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, standards, spades and so on will be to a certain extent different from where you live.
This is something you should always keep in mind in order to avoid disappointment or even aversion to local practices.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. A travel consultant is usually a good choice for trips that go beyond the traveller’s previous experience in terms of nature, culture, language or low income countries.
Although most agencies are willing to take over most of the regular bookings, many representatives specialize in certain types of travel, price ranges or destinations.
It can be more useful to use a travel consultant who often book similar trips as yours.
Take a look at the travels advertised by the travel agent on the website or in a shop window.
If you want to see the world needy, because of your lifestyle or as a challenge cost-effective, there are some ways to do so.
You can essentially be divided into two categories: either work while you travel, or try to reduce your spending. This article focuses on the latter.
For those who are willing to forego comfort, time and predictability in order to reduce spending almost to zero, see Travel with minimal budget.
The advice presupposes that travelers do not steal, commit trespasses, engage in black market activities, beg or otherwise exploit other people for their own benefit.
An immigration checkpoint is usually the first station when you get out of an airplane, ship or other vehicle.
On some cross-border trains, checks are carried out on the moving train and you should have a valid identity card with you when boarding one of these trains.
In night trains the passports can be collected by the conductor so that your sleep is not interrupted.
Registration is another necessity in the visa procedure. In some countries you have to report your presence and your residence address to the local authorities.
This means, for example, to fill out a form at the local police station or to present it to the immigration authority.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels take care of registration (do not forget to ask for it).
If necessary, only travellers who do not live in tourist accommodation must register. However, this makes the law much more unclear, so you should inform yourself before starting the trip.
The architecture deals with the planning and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in itself.
Many buildings are very beautiful to look at and the view from a high building or from a cleverly positioned window can prove to be beautiful.
Architecture overlaps in large parts with other disciplines, including urban planning, construction, decorative art, spatial design and landscape design.
Considering how remote many of the Pueblos are, you won't find a significant nightlife if you don't travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above serve drinks and some of them invite well-known entertainers (mainly the big casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Caution: The small-town pubs in this area are not always suitable for guests from outside.
On the one hand, northern New Mexico has significant problems with driving under the influence of alcohol. In the vicinity of small-town bars, the concentration of drunk drivers is particularly high.
Unwanted murals or smearings are known as graffiti.
Although it is anything but a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with teenagers who destroy public and private property with spray paint.
"Today, however, there are established graffiti artists, graffiti events and "legal" walls. In this context, graffiti paintings are more often like artworks than unreadable scribblings."
Boomerangwerfen is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang to get back to your hand, make sure you have a suitable boomerang.
Most boomerangs available in Australia do not actually return. Beginners should try not to throw in windy weather if possible.
A Hāngi dish is cooked in a hot hole in the ground.
The pit is heated with hot stones from a fire or in some places by geothermal heat, where the ground is naturally hot.
Hangi is often used to prepare a traditionally fried dinner.
Several locations in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other hangi can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes of commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as the first class) and Metro (called the third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but slightly more expensive – though still cheaper than regular metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro wagons. The MetroPlus cars are always at the end of the train that is closest to Cape Town.
Wearing for others – Never lose sight of your luggage, especially if you cross international borders.
You could be used as a drug messenger without knowing what brings you a lot of trouble.
This also includes waiting in line, since drug detection dogs could be used at any time and without notice.
In some countries, even for first-time offences, there are extremely draconian penalties, which may include prison sentences of over 10 years or the death penalty.
Unattended bags are a target for thieves and can also attract the attention of authorities who fear bomb threats.
At home, you are probably already immune to local germs because you are constantly exposed to them.
However, in other parts of the world, where the bacteriological fauna is new to you, you will encounter problems much more often.
In warmer climates, bacteria also grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Hence the scourges of Delhi Belly, the Pharaoh's curse, Montezuma's revenge and her many friends.
Like breathing problems in cold climate, intestinal problems are quite common in hot climates. In most cases, they are very annoying, but rather harmless.
If you are travelling to a developing country – or to a new part of the world – for the first time, you should not underestimate how strong the culture shock can be.
Many stable, capable travellers have already been overwhelmed by the different nature of travelling in developing countries, where the many small cultural differences can quickly add up.
Especially in the first days, you should consider using hotels, food and services of Western character and quality to facilitate acclimatization.
Do not sleep on a mattress or mat on the floor in areas where you do not know the local wildlife.
If you are camping outdoors, you should take a folding bed or hammock with you to protect yourself from snakes, scorpions, etc.
Fill your home with a delicious morning coffee and some relaxing chamomile tea in the evening.
If you are on holiday at home, you have the time to let it go well and invest a few more minutes to brew something special.
If you want a little more adventure, take the chance to make smoothies juicier or mix:
Perhaps you will find a simple drink that you can prepare for breakfast when you have returned to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighbourhoods that you don't often visit.
For those who know little about the medical jargon: The terms infectious and contagious have different meanings.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen such as a virus, a bacterium, a fungus or other parasites.
A contagious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted when you are near an infected person.
Many governments require incoming visitors or departing residents in their countries to be vaccinated against a number of diseases.
These conditions often depend on which countries a holidaymaker has already visited or which one he wants to visit.
One of the strengths of Charlotte (North Carolina) is that there is a wealth of high-quality offers for families there.
Residents from other areas often indicate family friendliness as the main reason for their move, and visitors with children feel very comfortable in the city.
In the last 20 years, the selection of child-friendly options in Uptown Charlotte has grown exponentially.
Taxis are usually not used by families in Charlotte, although they can be useful under certain circumstances.
For more than 2 passengers an additional fee applies, which may make this choice more expensive than necessary.
The Antarctic that surrounds the South Pole is the coldest place on earth.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical fitness, can only take place in summer (Nov–Feb) and are mostly limited to the peninsula, the islands and the Ross Sea.
A few thousand employees live here in the summer in about four dozen bases, mainly in these areas; a small number remains over the winter.
The inland of Antarctica is a lonely plateau covered with 2–3 km of ice.
Occasional specialized flight tours lead inland, to mountaineering or to the pole, where there is a large research station.
The South Pole Traverse (also known as the Highway) is a 1600 km long road from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
The road surface is flattened snow. Columns are filled with snow and marked with flags. The road can only be driven by special tractors, which pull sledges with fuel and supplies behind them.
These are not very agile, so the road around the Transantarctic Mountains has to make a wide arc to get to the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter are slippery roads, sidewalks (walks) and, above all, steps.
You need at least shoes with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are insufficient.
The profile should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more, and the material soft enough even at low temperatures.
Some boots have stollen and for slippery conditions there is additional equipment with stollen for the heels or heels and sole, which are suitable for most shoes and boots.
The heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered along roads or roads to improve soil adhesion.
Avalanches are not an anomaly; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow and the excess amount comes down as avalanches.
The problem is, the snow is stuck. Therefore, it needs a trigger to get the snow down. Some falling snow can be the triggering event for the rest.
Sometimes the original trigger is the sun that warms the snow, sometimes it is further snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human being.
A tornado is a swirling column of air with very low pressure, which absorbs and raises the surrounding air.
They generate strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air and swirl around.
They begin as funnels sinking from storm clouds and become "tornados" when they touch the ground.
Personal VPN providers (virtual private network) are an excellent way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofilters.
They are superior to web proxies for various reasons: they redirect all internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer higher bandwidths and better performance quality. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy on.
"The media companies regularly lie about the intention behind it and claim that it serves to "prevent piracy"."
Rather, the regional code has no effect on pirate copying. The bit-by-bit copy of a CD runs without problems on all devices on which the original runs.
The real purpose is to give these companies more control over their markets; it's all about profit.
Since the calls are routed over the Internet, you do not need to use a telephone company located at your place of residence or travel.
It is also not necessary for you to get a local number from the community you live in. You can get an Internet connection via satellite in the wild of Chicken in Alaska and select a number that indicates that you are in sunny Arizona.
In many cases, you have to buy a global number separately, to which you can be called via the public telephone network. Where the number comes from, makes a difference for the people you call.
Real-time text translation apps – apps capable of automatically translating entire sections of one text from one language to another.
Some of the applications in this category can even translate foreign language texts on signs or other objects in the real world when the user directs the smartphone to these objects.
Translation machines have dramatically improved your performance and now often provide more or less correct translations (and rare chewing vermin). Nevertheless, caution is required as they may still misunderstand everything.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading the data of the desired language.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone is probably the easiest and most convenient way to get around outside your home country.
This can save money because you don't have to buy new maps for a navigation device or a separate navigation device or rent one from a car rental company.
Your performance may be limited or unavailable if you have no data connection to your phone or if it is out of reach.
Each corner store is filled with a confusing selection of prepaid phone cards that can be used for pay phones or normal phones.
While you can call anywhere with most cards, some only serve to provide advantageous tariffs for certain groups of countries.
These services are often available via a free phone number, which can be called from most phones without charges.
The rules for normal photography also apply to video recordings, perhaps even more.
If it's not allowed to photograph anything, don't even think about taking a video of it.
If you are using a drone, you should check well in advance what you are allowed to film and which permits or additional licenses are required.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it is not illegal in their territory.
Nowadays, air travel is rarely booked directly with the airline without prior search and price comparisons.
Sometimes the same flight can have extremely different prices on different booking pages. Therefore, it pays to compare search results before booking and to check the airline's website for yourself.
Even if you do not need a visa for short stays in certain countries as a tourist or business, entry as an international student usually requires a longer stay than if you are travelling only as an ordinary tourist.
In general, long-term residence in a foreign country requires the prior application for a visa.
Student visas basically have different requirements and application procedures than normal tourist or business visas.
For most countries, you need a written offer from the institution where you want to study, and also proof that you have the resources to keep yourself water at least in your first year of study.
Find out about the individual requirements at the institution as well as at the immigration authority of the country in which you want to study.
If you are not a diplomat, it is generally the case when working abroad that you have to submit your income tax return in the country where you reside.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries and rates and rates vary greatly from one country to another.
In some federally organized countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied at both federal and local level, so tax rates and groups may differ from region to region.
While there is usually no entry control on arrival in your home country or this is merely a formality, customs control can be a nuisance.
Make sure you know what you can and can't introduce and specify everything that goes beyond the legal limits.
The easiest way to get an entry into travel literature is to refine your skills on an established travel blog website.
Once you've gotten used to formatting and editing online, you may also be able to create your own website later.
Volunteering on travel is a great way to change things, but it's not just about giving something.
Living in a foreign country and volunteering is a great way to get to know another culture, meet new people, learn about yourself, see things from a different perspective, and even learn new skills.
It can also be a good way to increase your budget to make a longer stay possible, because many volunteer services include food and lodging and some pay a small fee.
The Vikings used the Russian waterways to get to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes can still be used today. A special permit may be required to use them, which is not always easy to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic waterway links the North Polar Sea with the Baltic Sea via the Onegasee, the Ladoga Sea and Saint Petersburg, mostly via rivers and lakes.
The Onegasee is also connected to the Volga, so that a journey from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible.
Be assured that everything will be pretty clear as soon as you reach the moorings. You will meet other boat tramps who will share their knowledge with you.
Basically, you will offer your help, walk around the docks, approach people who clean their yachts, contact sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while everyone knows you and you will get tips on which boat someone is looking for.
You should carefully select your frequent flyer airline in an alliance.
Even if you might think that you should instinctively take the airline with which you fly the most, you should note that the benefits offered are often different. Frequent flyer points could be awarded more generously with another airline with the same connection.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their flights to Africa and have connections to numerous major African cities at low prices compared to European airlines.
From 2014, Turkish Airlines will fly 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra time to travel, check what your total travel costs to Africa look like compared to the cost of a world trip.
Do not forget to include the extra costs for further visas, departure fees, transportation on land, etc. for all the places outside Africa.
If you want to completely round the world in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is very limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes.
No aviation alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the southern hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not offer any of these connections).
However, Star Alliance covers everything outside the Eastern South Pacific from Santiage de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This flight is not the only option if you want to skip the South Pacific and the South American West Coast. (see below)
In 1994, the ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh waged war in Azerbaijan against the Azerbaijanis.
With Armenian support, a new republic was founded. However, it does not officially recognise an established country – not even Armenia.
Diplomatic disputes over the region continue to cloud relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal belt (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous district from the 17th century, which includes the city centre of Amsterdam.
The entire district has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its unique cultural and historical value and its real estate values are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means five countries, includes the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso in the Italian region of Liguria.
You're on the UNESCO World Heritage list.
Over the centuries, up to the cliffs that lie directly above the sea, terraces were carefully built into the rough, sloping terrain.
Its charm also includes the fact that there are no visible business buildings. The villages are connected by roads, trains and boats and there are no cars coming in from outside.
The variants of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from those spoken in France, but are similar enough to be understandable for both sides.
In particular, the counting method in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some minor peculiarities that differ from that in France, and the pronunciation of some words also differs slightly.
Nevertheless, it can be assumed that all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss have learned standard French at school and you understand, even if you use the normal French counting system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly gesture that signals a "hello".
"However, in Malaysia, or at least among the Malays in rural areas, it means "come here," similar to the curvature of the index finger towards the body, a gesture used in some Western countries, and should only be used for this purpose."
Similarly, a British traveller in Spain may misunderstand a wave to say goodbye, in which the palm is turned towards the waver (and not the person who is waved) as a gesture to come back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages that are created with the aim of facilitating communication between peoples that would otherwise be difficult to communicate.
They differ from the so-called Linguae Francae, natural or organic languages, which, for various reasons, are predominant as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
In the heat of the day, travelers can experience mirages that convey the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveler follows the mirage and wastes valuable energy and the rest of his water.
Even in the hottest deserts, it can get extremely cold at night. Without warm clothing, hypothermia is a real danger.
Especially in summer, they have to beware of mosquitoes if they want to walk through the rainforest.
Even if you drive through the subtropical rainforest by car, a few seconds with open doors are enough to take mosquitoes into the car.
Avian flu, or rather avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
There are fewer than a thousand documented cases in humans, but some of them were fatal.
Most cases concerned people working with poultry, but there is also a certain risk for birdwatchers.
Steep fjords and valleys, which unexpectedly pass into a high, more or less flat plateau, are typical of Norway.
These plateaus are often referred to as "vidde", which means a wider, open, treeless space, a limitless expanse.
In Rogaland and Agder they are usually called "hey", meaning a treeless moorland, often covered with heather.
The glaciers are not stable, but flow down the mountain. This creates cracks and crevices, which can be covered by snow bridges.
The walls and ceilings of ice caves can collapse and cracks can close.
At the edge of glaciers huge blocks break off, fall down and jump or possibly roll further away from the edge.
The tourist season for the hill stations usually reaches its peak during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and magic in winter. Numerous mountain stations have plenty of snow and have activities such as skiing and snowboarding on offer.
Few airlines still offer death rates with a slight discount on a last-minute trip to a funeral.
Airlines offering these services include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the USA or Canada, and Westjet.
In any case, you must book by phone from the airline.
