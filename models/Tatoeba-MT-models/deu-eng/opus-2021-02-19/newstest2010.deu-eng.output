Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
American President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma and the medal and a cheque of 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow along with his wife Michelle in the Northwegian metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he pays a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja of Norway.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony at which Obama accepts the prestigious prize.
He is the fourth President of the United States, but only the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already stated that Obama will talk about the war on Afghanistan when the price is taken over.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he will accept the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
A few days ago, he intensified the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgets to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the cheque for ten million Swedish kroner (about 24 million Czech kroner).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, attended by the Prime Minister and 250 invited guests in addition to Norway's King and Queen.
Obama was very reserved from the beginning to the price.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not quite deserve the price.
He also repeated several times that it was not just the price for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this was "call to action" for him.
Nature conservationist accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction proceedings last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police officer, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Nature Conservation Communityis Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in prison and he is threatened with a prison term of up to three years.
The sorting filling containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian villages you can find the sorting filling containers again and again.
What about Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage cans.
I do not want to say that waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors do not care enough about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all by the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is art, above all, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the Moravian Square opposite the hit goose.
Mr Onderka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but that seems to me to be far too little.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is also in other parts not honey slick.
Whole ranks of my friends therefore prefer not to sort the waste.
Out of laziness.
It's too far from the garbage cans for them.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles after the party.
But on Konicova Street, I didn't see any tins of paint in sight.
Fortunately, I got to the right place when I was driving a tram.
The garbage almost went over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The Paroubek budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and construction savings.
But not for the government debt interest or for the international court disputes.
This causes even more problems to those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or for the sickness allowance in addition. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future, mining," says Janota.
The loans pay higher and higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where to get from, the treasury is empty.
If social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party has now given more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
In order to get the pensions or the sickness benefit, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people need not be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year not only 163 billion will be missing in the treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will so increase faster and along with this also the costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
As a result of the transfer of money in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly discounted.
Mostly receive, which is also not free.
This means delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, and the creation of European money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it triggers the outflow of money in a Solomonish manner - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, where the state owns the majority, and from these the money is then distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, the budget for CEZ was 18 billion.
Every year, the dividends are paid for the environmental damage allowances, the pension account is filled up and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the Nieveau of 5.7 percent GDP, according to the EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of revolutions.
Nearly three billion fell the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can manage without this money is not certain.
It's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, Janota explains.
The minister must then save money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already begun two billion project "National Treasury", which is intended to enable monitoring on-line, for which the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch by pressing a single button between different operating systems.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and from Windows Mobile will change within a few seconds Android.
This is precisely what the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We enable you to run two user profiles on your mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware pointed out in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
The market will come in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a memory of 128 MB, on which the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working together with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the customer is expected to receive the devices within 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Scneeless slopes do not only worry the Krkonoše inhabitants.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are visited frequently.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if in our opinion this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, mentioned.
Who wants the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas, should no longer hesitate with the order.
If you prefer saving and the quality of your stay comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindlermühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Day.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they too will have to give in and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, appreciated Jandura.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, mentioned.
The Vrchlabi Travel Office can also offer New Year's Day in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer places available here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and somewhat better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou manage to occupy.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied by the central parking lot in Janske Lazne by 80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at the newest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A bit weaker is now February, but at the moment when snow comes, also interest in stays in the Giant Mountains certainly increases, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, pointed out.
The Krkonoše hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow shear.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, a warming will come again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost strange with which student eagerness Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the smartest, repeats his predecessor's strategy on the Afghanistan question, which he himself thought was the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off three years ago via the copy paper from the Bush Iraq scenario.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forward path", without timidity.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea of sending out fresh contingents of troops in Iraq, plagued by the civil war, as "irresponsible and in its aftermath a carastrophic decision."
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and very successful one, so far, that the news about Iraq no longer speaks at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, for objectively he left his successor with a much more appreciative starting point than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The military once again asked him to increase the contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of Afghanistan's operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordination habits, strongly criticized the timid shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but didn't come up with a better idea, so he cheated on the general wenist for 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
His intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years is highly problematic in the whole Obama strategy. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the fratricidal war of recent years, the Iraq society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by contraindication - nobody can be relied on and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only bogus structures, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the ambiguity of the conditions that further complicate Pakistan and Iran's influence.
The building of a "capable state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy puzzled by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is on the verge of the explosion.
Believe in the fact that the little soldiers, who broke out in the war cry about the "early homecoming", create a miracle here, can only a really romantic soul, which cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Kush foothills.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period when America is moving to the victory withdrawal from Afghanistan after Obama.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation patch for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time for him to resort to another strategy, which would turn out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive bonuses in cash
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from managers in the event of excessive risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street's premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the wider direction in which it has to go, the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, cited.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs set itself the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to the Reuters agency, the total amount of premium bonuses during this year will probably exceed 20 billion dollars even in spite of the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the beginning of the financial crisis.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers' bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, once with a tax of 50 percent.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all disciplines, except physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm have taken over this year's Nobel Prizes in the subject categories and for literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosons.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of the ribosome structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman was awarded a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have awarded this prize for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these prizewinners has received the diploma, Nobel Medal and certificate of purchase of the money prize.
It is worth ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prizewinners in each category, the money prize is divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversies of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and also at the head of the country that is waging two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
On Friday morning, President Vaclav Klaus receives the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, who thinks about his whereabouts in the government, because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Congress of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, about his further stay in office on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which is now being signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
In Parliament, however, the Left Party proposals on money circulation were voted on Wednesday and the money for the state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers were increased.
The government has countered the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Right Party, on the other, have therefore developed a sharp domestic political dispute, for which the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer official cabinet, on whose design the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of austerity measures that were enforced by the fishermen's government in the autumn, and that, in their understanding, is intended to put an end to public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the bill on the state budget but does not have to, said today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem", which is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolanek stated that the budget was horrific and that the government should weigh its further existence.
ODS vice-president Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial office as "strong pronouncements".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrifying, that the previous Topolanek government had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, CSSD rated the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world a lot of the country's struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the leading role was cast by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood movie.
Matt Damon plays another meaningful role.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he finally became a slave holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Allmmight", but rarely someone who is still alive and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how he spoke
The film portrays a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that even after apartheid, his people still remain racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players, who are among the outsiders worldwide.
After all, the South African team is rising to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked on it for several years to bring Mandela's story to the screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality as closely as possible, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It's important to me to have become another person.
Matt Damon portrays in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have dominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that it opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his analysis in the following words: "That was a very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret over Norway dissolved: Russians tested a rocket
About Norway a special light effect of unknown origin could be observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was not successful again and the rocket called the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence on site during the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been launched at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers one already writes about "Bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights up
This already 13th attempt, went normal at the beginning.
Technical damage to the rocket occurred only at the end of the flight.
Probably the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" started from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the water of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch of the submarine.
Therefore, it is probable that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern routes was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian rocket.
This time, the generality has protected itself against it and claims that it is not possible to speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without errors, the leadership of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fills the generality with optimism and so it is further asserted that the "Bulava" will fly without problems once and will carry even up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defensive player Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself at the age of 51 in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow in need, and probably already competes in the Friday Duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defenseman.
Fetisov trained regularly and agreed that he would support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, Nemcinov led.
When Fetisov gets back on the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one and was able to win 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
He has won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Championship titles and also triumphed in Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also scored in the NHL, where he twice topped the Stanley Cup in the Detroit Dressup.
He has been a member of the ice hockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime will be cancelled
The management of the Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the cancellation of all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman for the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they pay the overtime supplement or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28th and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek explained.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning point with regard to demands and complaints of trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk pointed out.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work 2 overtime hours practically every day after the eight-hour shift.
From the signing of the agreement, the willingness to strike on the part of the trade unions is revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they could agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they would be prepared to lift the willingness to strike.
The situation in the automobile factory intensified last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
On the other hand, the management held that the employees had to do the overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
The trade unionists also demanded that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday be not subject to sanctions in their Monday strike readiness declaration.
In the area of overtime, the unions call for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, they are calling for the payment of 5000 kroner this year.
The Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Serial production started in the company in November last year.
By this September about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ́stamped ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not have as much effect on common virus variants as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, the patient can prolong his or her life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus proliferation also leads to the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which no drugs are effective anymore.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalocarboranes have an effect on the protein that is responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in a different way than any medicine used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new ́improved ́ compounds, which were prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Secretive and Persistent Virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus split caused by HIV protease, no mature infection virus particles would emerge.
When we eliminate HIV protease, we also eliminate the proliferation of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The impact of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the test tube, including their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as with the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants, against which the used drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes metalocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
ODS went on fishing, he's fighting back.
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "grey" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The Prime Minister called the statement of the ODS "strong pronouncements".
It's supposed to take time for the analysis.
Deputy ODS Chairman Petr Necas said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to base himself in parliament on the minority when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he intends to remain in office with the help of the left-wing parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with proposals for amendments to the Left Party on more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants’ salaries, the maintenance of social benefits and direct payments to farmers.
The government has countered the proposals of the Social Democracy to covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wish, because even the modified budget is only a less bad variant of the budget commission. Frase not clear
Disappointment and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government still assesses the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering continuing to remain in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the budget compromise.
According to Necas, the nouns of Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government to what extent Fischer is voting in favour of the further struggle with the budget deficit.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is up to the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in a deputy position who are committed to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides not to fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he should rely on the majority of the left, which is currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is the case, I will deal with it, said the Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' Democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon to attend the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the revised budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the members of the citizens' democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We are not orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the next few months it would be mainly about bolshevization of Parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for approximately the same fare.
The Czech Railway will end or restrict some less busy express and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
From the date of validity of the new timetable, the total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. basic and customer fare will not be changed.
Several connections to the capital are available, for example, to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, and the railway uses Pendolino trains for this route.
The fast train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also run on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The railway in Hradec Kralove district (Königsgraz) is planning the largest reduction, a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the major changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change trains in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the Prague Central Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run within two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have not been able to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's account for regional railways: increase of 200 million
The rapid trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, and the railway will receive four billion kroner in the next year to cover the so-called loss of liquidity, just as this year. The local trains will supply the districts, and in total they will pay eight billion kroner next year, with the state investing three billion kroner.
This year, regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the fast trains, the railway has signed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps so they have not been able to raise prices for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes occur only with one-day network tickets CD Net and with cheap Internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven plug, until now it was uniform for travel between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
Philippine millitants arrest more than 50 people, and the children were released.
Millitans today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
That is what the AFP agency has said, which initially informed only 65 people who had been kidnapped.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the rest of the hostage.
According to the agency AFP, the millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local famillien clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the law of standing was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which coincided with the election to the governorship, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Filipino province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
The island of Mindanao is also home to Muslim separatists.
But those who resumed the peace negotiations with the Filipino government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will be shown in the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly selected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the cinema launch of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public are loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Roliglaha Mandela, born July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakhar Prize, in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when, on the one hand, preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa, but at the same time the media shakes the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, in his own words, is still proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I - as they say - can receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns everyone, he added.
Dressed by the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African advocate of human rights in his first presidential election period.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman tries to bring together two racial groups and, since year and day, each other, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the World Cup field in his role in the South African National Rugbydress, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white public and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may be able to unite people into one people, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving will only become apparent.
However, the white South Africans are sceptical, as revealed by the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain in a recent interview for LN.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally the fire department wanted the transformers to burn out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the safety of the management system according to the company spokesperson, Pavla Mandova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will only be quantifiable after the fire.
According to Mandova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For over 10 years nothing similar has happened in the company Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, they added.
According to the spokesperson of CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted, the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as sole operator of the line system, the electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgears with 67 transformers, which transmits the electrical energy into distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura charges three heads of the CSSD with slander.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today charges three social-democratic leaders with slander.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is related to the company's efforts to operate regional trains in some districts.
However, all regions have signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take the raisins out, but we only made the offer about the size as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railways, because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were completed last week.
So we have nothing but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Student Agency Society, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the lawsuit to be the further continuation of Jancura's medial show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that in this matter too it will become clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses lying and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million kroner in advertising, which will point to the adverse step taken by the districts.
He told the radio journal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year.
He specified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on regional rail services with the Czech Railways and did not tender for the contract at a cost of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts.
The only threat was if we didn't give up the possibility of losing the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said today Jancura to the radio journal.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Imfung against pneumococci changes the usual from January.
It is said to be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But even now, voices have been voiced that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
culminating the preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting the maximum prices of the vaccines that health insurance companies have to pay.
Experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January onwards, children can be vaccinated for free against pneumococci born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
Those who have already started the vaccination in the past year or earlier must pay for further repeat vaccination themselves.
The first dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for one dose.
Vaccination of the youngest children requires four doses.
On the whole, the experts estimate that the health insurances spend 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year on vaccination doses.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all the area vaccinations of the children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections cause up to 28 children up to 10 years of age to die in hospitals every year.
Outside the Czech Republic, compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
For example, Rudolf Kalovsky, head of the Nahlas Association of Citizens, mentioned that the mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association has long been promoting pneumococcal vaccination.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to achieve at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, led Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist association of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabronochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of re-vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Cabronochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that this is the first area vaccination paid by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, explains Cabronochova.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern of the practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be bought by the insurance companies and the doctors should receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the state to them.
Some MEPs feared, however, that the insurance companies could "execute the money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
According to the estimates, individual practitioners will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This is not going to be easy, says Cabronochova.
US artist son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal 20 million dollars worth of paintings from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his vehicle with trailer while loading 90 paintings.
They say Frank Frazetta Jr. and another man used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures like Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
According to the Associated Press news agency, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior denied any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending freezes announced in the pre-budget report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had "spent" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer was also under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5-percent increase in social security and a 1-percent cap on public wage settlements for 2011.
Social Insurance Fund
The unions have protested that low-wage earners are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of imminent "problems".
The increase in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has upset the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than 20,000 pounds a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
POINTS OF THE PREVIOUS ETATH REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5 % from April 2011
This year the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax for small enterprises rejected
Tax rebates for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of government pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 per year poorer and someone with £40,000 per year will be £190 poorer, while a person with £10,000 per year income will be £110 richer.
Ministers said their deficit halving target for 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the extra tax burden would be on the 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending freezes would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big figures. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions of future economic growth – which affects the size of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction – were questioned after the Chancellor of the Treasury was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year – much more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while debt would be £3 billion higher than previously forecast.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the planned indebtedness of £789 billion over the next six years would be unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and "cynic" to avoid difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything of any importance about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass by."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police are protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservatives' proposals, which see deficit capping coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by the tax increases and spending freezes is not used to cover next year's spending, to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - such as the inflation adjustment above for some disability pensions next April - the Chancellor of the Exchequer would suspend the accusation of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra help when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although ministers have not disclosed budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only materialise in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said that the figures of the Chancellor of the Exchequer would mean strong reductions in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, accountant at the audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary budget report, and the markets see it."
FBI investigates "Destination of U.S. Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens for suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Punjab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said they're investigating if these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of State said they're also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," said Spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the U.S. "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "misuse" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, the human rights situation in Iran is still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC-Teheran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Detention Centre.
But since then there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, said our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They often slapped me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty shared.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a container in a detention centre in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's reactions to it, but so Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results gained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes have been set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competition runway.
The ski slope of this parking event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short ski jump at the beginning of a 100-meter-long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the lights of the city glistening below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still she and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a construction ban for minarette and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most explicitly secularized societies in Europe — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argued study of a dispute that divided and occupied the country over a decade and a half and whose effects can still be perceived today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic freedom".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, that make up daily life, in contrast to the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Bowen questioned are mostly disunited with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – who nowadays show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) feel truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular Republicanism.
He sees a "increase in the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most desolate view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts with alarming speed and takes life with it that nowhere else can survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have recently entered open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Experienced in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proved themselves in hunting the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to the sea, who only fought with the rifle butt of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have one millionth of the life of a wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became completely green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the shooting continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and snow-mobile Inuit use powerful assault rifles to hunt down their prey.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of Arctic science and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century for the first time suggested the whirling of the pack ice.
Undersea boats in the Cold War the shifting ridges during the descent.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale application of measuring probes on icebergs, but much is still achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater troughs compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, all are threatened by the summer ice once passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... it could be us"
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
The Chief Private De'Angello Robinson traveled by bus for seven hours to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine infantrymen who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they stepped.
In a few months, from wherever we're brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to place wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who undertake this journey every year, stop in various cities along the way to perform events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across Amerika (Kräze all over America), which has also extended the event to other countries.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at the Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, at graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the Memorial to United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to return something to those who made sacrifices.
She said that's a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War as their goal, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held hands while they carried the fresh pine branches to the greying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends stuck together in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white maps, which had been put into the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the burial site of Marine Infranterie sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"When I haven't been around for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
US government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the State Department on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers from the U.S. Interest Group in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5th.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although according to Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything, under the charge of "hazard".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro brother's communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy places great importance on the United States to provide compensation if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought after products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are used primarily for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet usage on the island is extremely restricted.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes like drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesperson for the U.S. Interest Representation in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Same Cuba", an allusion to the appointment of Raul Castro as the country's leader, replacing the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within one day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards each other for more willingness to dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hoped this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had tracked them down because one of them had made positive comments on terrorist attacks on the YouTube Internet video page.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service who was briefed on the matter said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the Al Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and kept trying to get the right recommendations to get access to the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men - who continue to be in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and, possibly more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a matter of utmost urgency to place human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as porters who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American wannabe recruits are subject to a special audit by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be tremendously attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years regarding who they are allowing access, as the U.S. secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate "action" in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded bolder action on climate protection from the negotiators in the city's Bella Congress Centre.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to amount to about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosive devices near some government buildings in the city centre.
On one day, when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists with banners wandered through the city, where "There is no Planet B" was written in English, and one in Spanish, which declared "The Earth says "Enough".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that her travels to Peru, her mother's country of birth, made her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country has to contend with due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the reasons why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to pass the floor and appeal to the world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who didn't want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothes lit several explosive devices near the main canal in Copenhagen, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares, but then followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest apparently did not reach the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depends on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent race gap
The evidence of mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although Washington District is still far behind the country's high-performance schools, the evidence shows that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) figures is the persistent performance gap between African American and white students, both at local and national level.
The average score of the white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) in the last two years, but that of their African American peers rose only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eighth graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was captured in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have achieved has increased over this period, the difference with now 58 points has hardly decreased.
Some of the district's educational supporters expressed concern last week that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall ranking by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates educational equality in Washington D.C.
I am not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Councilman Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of exam scores is that the city's middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What frightens me, however, is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and middle school, who have not mastered basic literacy skills at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their peers of the same age.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and lifelike experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to make the best of the measures available to students below grades, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the extra money and resources for the low-performance schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, who is investigating urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could have political aftermaths working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year over 185 days per year, which he regarded as "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The coach reaches the Gettysburg-College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, steps out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eighth graders of the group who explore Gettysburg, where the tuition costs 38,690 dollars per year, was more of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when the low professor-to-student ratio of the school was reported to her.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th one the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken up the intended message completely: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to get into the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" of Hispanic Americans completes college – which is a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the US without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who study powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counselling programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to college, especially if these efforts persist over a long period of time.
Looking at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Hispanic American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that Graciela's college tour funded is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - Turn up a gear - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to run until they have completed high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom went to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to persuade major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The ten contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has made a shortcoming.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals in opening up the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, Asians and Europeans are giving way, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability from the withdrawal of the US military, have probably prevented American oil companies from doing so, analysts said they would engage more in Iraq, which has the world's third largest proven crude oil reserves.
US companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could enter into contracts with the Department.
Larger US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have supported them with technical advice in recent years, have run out.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its competitors and will fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
Companies preselected for bids were bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda planner is said to have been killed this week, reported representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism campaign on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second fatal attack on a senior terrorist organization leader this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities, were said to have been killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a government representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism movement cited indefinite evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as the leading Al-Qaeda military planner who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous and pointed to the delicate nature of US air strikes on Pakistani soil.
If one assumes its central role as given, this also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and turned them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that Somali had quickly ascended to the Al Qaeda hierarchy and maintained the best ties with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but this does not in any way reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has decreased from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be based on improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The UN's leading envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from office in March, ending a stormy term of office clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eide's departure took place when the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US military withdrawal schedule, which is to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces, sending the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign from office, but only fulfilled an agreement made in March 2008 with his family to remain in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UN
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now forward so that he has time to provide a replacement.
What I said was that he'd better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started searching for a replacement according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eides has rejected all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith's accusations - who was fired - "have undoubtedly harmed the mission because there has already been a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged that the UN leadership allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at restricting his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is disastrous and must not go on like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in talks about his nuclear plans.
During a seven-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good choices, he said in answer to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that are on my mind is, if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, the war's own unpredictability."
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will have to face "credible" consequences if it does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume talks to limit its nuclear programme and would forego a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
Gates said that Iran has simply left the international community behind in relation to some of the proposals they had already agreed to at the beginning of October, openly saying that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, has brought them together in a way that they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran.
President Obama has set the 31 Dec as the deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "impressive sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's representation at the United Nations condemned what it called "fundamental and unfundamental claims" by some Security Council members on Iran's nuclear activities on Thursday, saying that they are ready to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, especially in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays in US plans to reduce American troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change of Course in Ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters giving them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One baby more means a grave more."
They learned these lessons so well that, when government officials in Shanghai, who were suddenly starting to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than one child, due to the low birth rate and the ageing population this summer, their answer was immediate and definitive: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a head of personnel with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously fat, spoiled single children, who are affectionately called "little emperors", a population crisis in the country is looming.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN
Department of Population Issues, while the number of population groups aged 60 and over in 2020 is set to increase from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and olders accounted for almost 22 percent of reported Shanghai residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age must have babies to "help reduce the ratio of ageing populations and alleviate the labour shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A Gradual Relaxation
Established in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial order introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Married couples who violate this policy have to face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplaces.
Chinese state representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical demands of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to abort.
Many couples had also had gender-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child politics.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University's Department of Population Research, said that government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with whom a partner is an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters instructing families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines describing in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and put leaflets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice to those who have more than one child.
The response was not very encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outdoor areas of Shanghai said that an upswing can be seen in the requests of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
For the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are still received per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of Caolu Township in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want to have children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this is also legally permitted.
But, like many Chinese, they have only a minor health and life insurance policy from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one-child politics as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yeah, we're being robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of personnel, said she only wanted a child because she was an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want to do so."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-class parents with a double career, through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it revolves around being successful and for that one has to be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to remodel your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a CV for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has once again set a focus on Friday with the publication of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrial nations shouldering the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, has both identified the remaining obstacles and shown the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 top politicians from all over the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also provides a range of options for key issues, including how industrialised and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature rise that policy makers would support.
The process is given great flexibility, said John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarised a 180-page text of negotiations to focus on what UN climate change leader Yvo de Boer called "the big picture".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which the industrialised nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost through its pledge to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks, which had determined the talks last week.
The US climate special envoy Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if these are not financed by developed countries.
This train announced that the Obama administration is driving a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging economies standing up and taking action, says Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his statement an hour after the statement of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, who said that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China to cope with global warming.
By the fact that the future economic march of the great world powers is at stake, break lines have emerged both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle is both about saving individual economies and saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the great powers were fighting for who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to act more aggressively to hold the countries with a very high greenhouse gas levy accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, says Ulate, who is also working as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change stated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case scenario.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states is exerting "political pressure on the entire political process" partly because they are now united and are calling for action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks received a new urgency when delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues had to be resolved before the leaders arrived to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, got off their planes and raced through the Bella Center's corridors to hold meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to stake claims that will be negotiated over the next week.
The sheer size of the meeting -- 13,000 people go in and out every day at the convention center, guitar-playing activists do night shows, making fun of the countries that they think are betraying and selling, and contract drafts are passed on hand-to-hand instead of email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President of Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines the feeling of Monday
Monday morning at 5:13 a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will travel from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras 225 km/h and travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually link Britain to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become a vibrant commuter city, work time would be radically reduced, and the switch from plane to car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and concerns about environmental damage could still pull the brakes on British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, will present the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This gives it a detailed map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London with the West Midlands will pass through urban areas and places where environmental impacts are disputed with a five-metre travel distance.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, northward-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide in or near Birmingham and a junction would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railroad insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to a little over an hour today.
The drafts would allow trains to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was planned so that 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be in service on the London-Birmingham line.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal would be needed in London where 20,000 travellers per hour could be handled.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would mean that the journey time between London and Scotland would continue to be over three hours.
This is regarded as a crucial crux of the matter, so that a change from aircraft to rail can be ensured, a measure of direction for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for a conservative's mortgage for 75,000 pounds of orangery
Alan Duncan, the Conservative leader in the House of Commons, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that members of the House of Commons had to live "from lean rations", has raised his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to have an oak semi-timber cultivation built on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
Those in charge of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time, and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is carrying out a review of the expenses of the members of the House of Commons. Last night Duncan said that the requests could not have been "more clean or understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control center of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he cultivated a conservatory, which is called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked by the Standards and Privileges Committee to comment on increased borrowing during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts.
The committee acquitted him last month after examining his expenditures from breaking the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of £271,406 ($300,000) from his London house to his constituency house, which he bought in 1991, a year before his election as a member of parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) a month as mortgage interest by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase was used to finance the borrowing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him after saying after the spending scandal that members of parliament would live "from lean rations".
"In essence, working for the state means living on lean rations and being treated like S*****e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I claim to have a tiny portion of it, in proportion to what is right.
And I could have claimed the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his earlier career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could be "considered an exaggerated demand".
As a protest in Duncan's lawn, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound sign after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the raised mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate about dodging and sleeping or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
Come all you believers to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content as an interactive Advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas carols as a theme for each December day.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies filled with dried fruit pastries.
The Christmas carols selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer cleric of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar started as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where the police have made several hundreds of arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes to this, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed by, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, smashed showcases with paving stones and hammers, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-Unrest Police officers intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people, according to your assessment mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, have been arrested in eastern France, in April, by these extremely violent splinter groups, which have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested "without distinction", and has underlined that about one hundred of them "still were held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and sitting position.
The rather peaceful move has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the designated speakers, for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators arrived with busts and trains from the big European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with sky-blue raincoats, made a first casserole in Copenhagen in the morning, as you followed the call of the Earth's friends to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological guilt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, the figure of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, has launched the demonstrations.
According to the organisers in Australia, about 50,000 people have taken to the streets.
In Manila there were several hundreds of people, mostly students who marched in red and hoisted bandanas in which you boasted the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, marches of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, and Georgia has denounced that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "trunk".
About 131,000 people were called upon to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control over the South Ossetic territory, another Georgian secessionist area that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations are closed at 17 GMT.
Voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the polling station was closed, according to the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including former President Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under total Russian occupation, his press officer, Manana Manjgaladze, has declared.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted for Lord Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are all located in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, who raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, which was represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia to control the railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday all over the world to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready for action, arrested about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which by 18 December welcomes delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was set up to welcome the designated speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to smash windows, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-Unrest Police officers immediately circled you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
Towards evening, a policeman suffered an injury from a cobblestone on his chin during the incidents in which, according to the police, about twenty people were arrested. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the police were circling in the air.
Most demonstrators who arrived by train or by car from German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to form a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say any more: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, there are rivers through which you can walk, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of anti-globalizationists has approached environmental organisations.
French MEP and globalization critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world today."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people have taken to the streets, according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed in red with bandanas, have made advertisements for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Djakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined forces during the demonstrations organized by the "Network of 350", in particular in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of the Lycées.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", Luc Chatel, Minister of National Education, explained that geography and history are the subject of the Lycées' school reform, even if they are not taught in the terminals (12th school year).
"The pupils of the Première (11th school year) now have the same programme every four hours a week," confirms Mr Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but by and large a concentration of "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become an under-profile of the scientific profile," he continued. He underlined: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticise the state project to abolish compulsory education in history and geography at Terminale S (12th school year with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticised this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of restricting the philosophy of Terminale S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which she felt would be the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they were subject to a subject-related aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year to an admission test in which their teaching skills were examined.
In addition, they do internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you will reach even more hours you have spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally declared that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed again that he wanted to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
According to a journalist from the AFP, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts turn to the audience with filmed contributions for fifteen minutes each.
One wants to do something to reach the people and to make them feel like they want to know more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the fringes of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to the fish in the basin of the school.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants were selected, even after their charisma," he explains.
"You can talk about global warming for hours, but the key objectives can also be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely to about 50 people only with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he said, hoping that the audience will learn from it that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online from December 15th on the school's website.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the prison officials' unions called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime, which were deferred until January for budget reasons, are paid before Christmas holidays.
The Second Union of Penitentiaires (FO-Pénitentiaire), called on the employees who were not on duty to demonstrate in front of the penitentiary on Tuesday morning and to block them in order to draw attention to the "theft of what was due to them".
The 3rd Union of Prison Guards (CGT-Pénitentiaire) called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtime, night allowances and Sunday and holiday surcharges in October is branded as "innocent and unacceptable".
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The administration of the penitentiary and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime in 2009 has risen sharply and not all of them were budgeted, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
In the evening, the Ministry of Justice announced that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of prison officials guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functioning and modernizing," the Minister of Justice informs in this letter.
"I have instructed the administration of the prison to take immediate action so that such a situation, which was caused by a lack of assessment of overtime, will not be repeated in the future," added Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore meagre, except for the management staff, who benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "household constraints" must be held.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseilles indignantly announces that it will boycott "all gatherings and convocations" until new instructions have been issued.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, when the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime", threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being assigned to us without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich the staff's funds is more than inappropriate," said the Bordeaux CGT union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama thinks he's always giving Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, told TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is always giving better gifts than he gets himself.
On a special broadcast on Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama, adding that the dog also gets a gift, of course.
Michelle Obama firmly rejected her husband’s claims on the quality of gifts. “I made you beautiful gifts last year,” she teases the president.
"So, please," he ensnared, screeching, pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an informal atmosphere with the well-known TV presenter, whom Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the President and his wife also talked about gifts that they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten gears and also a basketball that his father, whom he very rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father once visited us for Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
"Only much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll's house," Michelle Obama told me.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL confirmed that he was put into artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles for serious "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was put into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found "damages caused by the operation of a disc incident" which he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damage had necessitated a new operation.
The singer's production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical report would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, did the patient's condition become more certain when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources it is clear" that after his first operation in Paris "no Dränage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated on in the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a disc incident.
The procedure, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday night.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt to RTL on Thursday that his friend is going through a "deep valley". However, he assured himself that one does not have to worry about the rock musician, since he is "a good fighter".
"He called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was bullshit to sit on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacted well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was contained".
Mr. Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not felt any particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer's health had grown ever since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, it was said that Johnny Hallyday had a "small colorectal cancer surgery", which led to a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to refuse another admission to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Shortway: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday about his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 at the short circuit in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
One record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of gentlemen.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to reach for the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big basin (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman held his own in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated Croat Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater things and in this case I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all floats started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which started in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
This time, the combination has not paid off for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann explained.
USA : Grave plate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tombstone, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola of all places, was estimated at $1.5 million on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the IIIth century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophistic architecture decor surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, vice president for auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered most of so far," says Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous Borghese family collection, then appeared piece by piece with French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom at her hotel in Paris, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's escape from Honduras towards Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on domestic soil to be incompatible, after this escort had rejected the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place during the night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the Immigration Department, the plane, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the transfer of M. Zelayas, had returned to his place of departure.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to "abandon" and ask for political asylum abroad.
However, the overthrown president refused, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcome incumbent head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a renewed failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," said M. Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has often spoken out since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and gladly for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some chords.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for escort, which we unfortunately cannot accept, since it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Interior of the Putsch government, told the Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, had answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur channel, which is based in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had pointed out, would only take place as president of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of M. Zelaya's departure had mobilized the supporters of the overthrown president, who had gone to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around them, and the military there had stepped up their efforts.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the popular referendum he organized in preparation for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He had returned from his exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for high treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
President Roberto Micheletti has succeeded in organising a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had massively voted against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street upswing, US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed with a high on Thursday, the figures for the American trade balance testify to a recovery in the share price of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, in turn, dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor ́s 500 was written with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-full glasses", so it moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the American trade balance "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States’ trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October.
The analysts, on the other hand, expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the Business Research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States rose last week, contrary to expectations, and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers had "falled to the low of the year," stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.432% on Tuesday night, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4.492% compared to 4.408% on the eve.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power whistle "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, several hundreds of partisans in Cuban power flouted the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day, and also thwarted another rally for which a dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested.
Around forty "women in white", wives or close-ups of political prisoners, were whistled out on the open street by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just when they were on the walk to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, confirmed a journalist of the AFP.
Down with the Yankies!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!" the authorized partisans chanted against the dissidents with their fists raised.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "guarantee their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "women in white" had taken place in Havana on the eve of the night, during which there were neither injured nor arrested.
In the havan district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also took part in the Thursday demonstration in the face of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, a reporter from the AFP confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents who had been booed by the partisans of the government to enter civilian vehicles under force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Women in White" have organised an unauthorized march for the purpose of "the release of all political prisoners", whose number is around 200 according to the dissident list, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison term.
M. Maceda is a member of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom are currently in prison.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents of the regime as "merkers" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contrarevolutionarys".
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, in particular those of freedom of expression.
Insanity kills eighty-year-olds with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A maniac armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old on Friday against late afternoon at the main business hours in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
According to the first information of the interview, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old with two knives from a previously unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, and this, according to police data, with the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, was killed in the hospital, according to an officer of the police syndicate Alliance, as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the thirties, intervened and got hurt.
The first two victims were sent to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life, since, according to police sources, vital organs have apparently been affected.
The pregnant woman became ill as a result of the events and according to a police source she was hospitalized in "shock condition".
The armed man, who, according to police, seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, immediately escaped to the street, the same boulevard of Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passers-by, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old, but the latter heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, declared on site Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine region.
Several passers-by, including youths, were reported to have tried to tame the madman, according to the reports of the AFP.
I saw a guy in the thirties with a green vest.
Three youths tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were stabbed, according to police reports.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby came to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cuts.
Armed forces of the state police finally arrested the man who did not carry identification papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has commissioned the District Division of the Criminal Police Department of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source doesn't rule out him being admitted to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, six policemen ordered him to be restrained at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" like "all mental confusions of this kind, in which the forces are released during the course of the action".
USA: Polanski’s lawyer calls for a renewed cessation of prosecution
The lawyer of French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called for the prosecution of his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago, in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) on Thursday.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced three judges of the Appeals Court in the second district of California gross procedural errors at the time of the trial in 1977.
On the spot, I demand remission, said M. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was appointed to the case at the time of the trial, "went it down your back cold."
According to him, the judge Rittenband, who had died in the meantime, had discussed his verdict with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a prison, which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and lost" (Roman Polanski: haunted and coveted), especially by David Wells, the prosecutor in question.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "falsified" the authors of the documentary.
Should the Court of Justice refuse to close the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel will require the conduct of a trial that would allow him to submit the evidence for his reasoning.
For its part, the prosecution has repeated the evidence already explained at first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the annulment of the facts accused of the accused cannot be seriously considered unless Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the USA in 1978, even before the sentence was pronounced for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has not travelled to the USA.
The Los Angeles County deputy prosecutor, Phyllis Asayama, had declared that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that escape is a way out?, asks Mrs. Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and thus despises his authority."
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out "that there are other escape alternatives".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded that the criminal proceedings be lifted again.
She recalled that her client would no longer endure being harassed by every resurgence of the Affaire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise of the dollar and closes without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed off on Friday in a market torn between better indicators than the US and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is pretty quiet," Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
"It remains narrowly limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think this will continue until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "contributed to improving the market view to the solidity of the recovery of the economy", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and much more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence improved significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes have been slowed down by a new rise in the dollar price, which has reached the highest level against the euro for the last two months, pushing ''the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation down', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose by 3.540% on Wednesday evening, compared with 3.482%, and that of the 30-year bond rose to 4.497%, compared with 4.492% of the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates to the title of Miss World will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this in front of a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is being held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a veritable vortex of pleasure.
To visit beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and had a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, from 5 p.m. (3 p.m. Central European Time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focuses on the contest.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, it's every woman's dream to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defile in traditional costumes and not to forget, in swimsuit.
The performance is presented by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that the world knows how to receive with an unsurpassable cordiality and pride, says Julia Morley, Chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari to visit the famous township in Soweto, but this time they did so by bike and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a type of country to promote this event a little more.
I'm wrong about people I could probably never get close to.
I will surely come back to the 2010 World Cup, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi enthusiastically.
According to his son David, the news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane, when he arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 CET).
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would "fastest" go to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following surgery on a disc incident on November 26th.
The singer "was put into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles in order to relieve his severe pain and perform his treatment, announced the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following a disc surgery on November 26th.
The singer had to undergo surgery again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer from the AFP noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hôpital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles hospital on Monday.
The producer has severely strained neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on 26 November at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had done the purest massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said that they were indignant, Mr. Camus explained.
I have heard that a trial may be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "has travelled far too quickly and with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally spoke to this doctor on the phone, who assured me that he saw this journey as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I already had two intervertebral disc surgeries behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist's environment.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted of tax evasion and fraud several times because of failed operations and not to forget.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Association, has described him as "a man without scruples", who is "regularly" responsible to the Board of Appeal and is "everything other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention was "perfect" and that the post-operative investigations were "normal".
The operation "does not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been running since this summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), said Mr. Camus.
The UDF Party Alliance (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal
The party alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem party, reacted strongly on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and asked him, under threat of legal prosecution, not to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after reaching out to the left.
Incidentally, the Secretary of Defense, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In order to strengthen his efforts, he had received the support of the MP Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now NC), who claims the property of the UDF brand, since he was the first to apply for this trademark in 2004 at the "Institut national de la proprieté Industrielle".
However, the office of the UDF party alliance supervised by François Bayrous's friends broke the silence and clearly indicated that they did not allow themselves to be expropriated and placed a time limit for the Minister and the MP to stop using this seal and transfer the property rights of the trademark to it under threat of judicial prosecution.
In recent days, you have made numerous statements that you would propose to your political movement to accept the UDF seal+, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today's UDF + printed on your political material as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you are not entitled to the use of this seal, the UDF office explained and called on the NC party to "excessly remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the property rights of the trademark to its legal entitled persons".
If you refuse to do so, we will sue you to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave it in 2007 in order to establish a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to found the UMP party.
Therefore, according to the signatories, the Nouveau centre party has no rights to use the Union pour la démocratie française.
They also recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 passed three years of membership of the MoDem Party and the establishment of a branch to defend "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "at the time when he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF to carry this out for himself.
You also point out that this recklessness is on the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems more dignified to us in politics as well as in life to make a name for yourself, rather than trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently acquiring a name in which you have no legal claims".
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier condemned for exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court of Justice decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has used a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to steal part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photographs, will have to answer for exploitation of weakness in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a crime punishable by a maximum imprisonment of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are raging and at the same time the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal have in hand.
However, the 15th Trial Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions provided by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you will make clear whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to go through these tests.
I will talk to her, explained the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The expert report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, whom one must protect, he affirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having exploited her mother's weakness for years in order to steal donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always disproved that she had been manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a long-time friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer has appealed to three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyer's husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please tell my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since she was married."
The Procuratorate of Nanterre once again considers that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially because in recent days a guardian judge has refused to apply for a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," affirmed Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor's representative.
The Court has now decided to give a judgment after the admissibility of Ms Bettcourt-Meyers has been brought.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of management of large companies in terms of its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution: It is intended for the personnel to join "values" determines the best, as it used to impose on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separately factors preferences of customers again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon affecting employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of R&Eund, which is even more crucial, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) calls for "a proactive approach and a forward-looking perspective from all parties involved"; it claims from the employees a commitment to which the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution that would consist in placing the employees in the center of the company's concerns on an equal footing with the customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that, given a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure finally comes to do as it always did.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a much simplified idea of human behavior.
Her interpretation of psychology is mechanistic from the major engineering schools.
Through intellectual comfort, they adopt the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "Neurosciences" and unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and suggesting that it is possible to use the "sic" to engage employees, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey by Ipsos encourages managers in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating a fundamental protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for wage earners, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears to be clearly a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambition and intentions.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given doxa that allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management in the right place again.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American Right welcomed the speech given by Barack Obama on the eve of Oslo on Friday and was pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who mocked the award to Obama on October 9 applauded the President's speech this time, following the example of the former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained the face of the Republican Party's right wing in the USA Today newspaper and added that she herself raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs published in the same way.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; a way to declare his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, believed that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, ex-president of the House of Representatives exclaimed, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I felt this speech to be quite historic, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who is regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" reminding the members of the Nobel Committee that "they were not free and could not give a price for peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "cosmopolitan" as "he always does," he "speaks like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live like in a security bubble that they didn't create themselves and for whose protection they don't do much," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, tedious and inspirative."
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the use of the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the guise of justice, you can easily justify the massacre of the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left continues to praise the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama prematurely, called the speech "Monumental Work" even for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a roadmap for managing international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California daily excites.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Long-distance drivers: Three marathons for an agreement to secure the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the unions of the Road Federation and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening, which puts an end to the strike order and the threat of severe shortage of supply at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "welcomed" the agreement which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiation, the negotiators parted early on Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And even though the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting furiously.
However, more than six hours passed from the start of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was not signed until 6:00 p.m.
The conflict "had caused a lot of damage to companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year", said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
Thus, the hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages rises from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"That's not much, but we'll start small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now being instructed not to block the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some unruly people who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF president Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and for the maintenance of the total road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable the issue of 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements to be addressed.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction in employers' contributions of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 bill of adjusted finances adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government demands "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to the organisation and then, if extended by the Minister of Labour, to the entire profession.
This will be the case "in no time", says Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the proceedings.
The FNTR campaigned for "fraudful trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector in order to offset some of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to upset the goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, laments the Unostra.
For the Otre association, the agreement threatens "to dig a grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP's proposals
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest rail network in France for the Greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of the strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), left strikers waiting for their demands for wage increases.
There were no trains on this important shopping weekend before Christmas between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was operational and only one of four trains outside the central line.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP strives to connect the large shops with traffic technology".
The RER A line crosses the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP section connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated at peak hours, and almost none operated during the low-traffic period.
As on Thursday, there was no human commotion on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he had "standing up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of passengers by staff and administrative staff, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left via Saint-Lazare station to ensure connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday there were again general meetings of strikers, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
This is not what the drivers want, however. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-due wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged by the fact that the RATP itself put its wage supplement proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is not able to solve a problem, whereas this was also possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" was scheduled for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "is ignoring weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leader who, until then, refused any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to spread to the RER B line after a preliminary announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously more difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution. Moreover, he pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including Chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political action for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the Party's assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Before the verdict, the party leaders said that parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than sit down like non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision was followed by a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "wisdoms" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court intercedes with the government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to make the support of the PKK by the Kurds run out and to put an end to the conflicts.
DTP leaders reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a re-emergence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan's detention conditions had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP premises in the metropolis of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The police used tear gas grenades and water cannons when the demonstrators started throwing molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision "will deepen despair even further".
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, editorial note) question on the basis of a party's ban," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously prepare for a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The Snowfall Can Come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
But so that his employees can learn to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, this could be the first weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES will proceed according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are driven off with large spreaders, explains Brauburger.
These include major roads and thoroughfares such as the Neues Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire brigade accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
If necessary, the approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with wet salt that adheres better.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it does not snow until 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the stray vehicle".
Only after that, if it does not snow any further, are feeder and development roads, including the Rat-Beil-Straße, the turn.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES foot people set off, and danger points and crossings were cleared as a priority.
The FES can usually not take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which mainly keeps an eye on the bridges, says Brauburger.
Since there is smoothness on this fast, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary, the police will also call him.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be anything special.
However, Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reporting Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday.
About 215 million years ago, the animal lived in today's New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangäa at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they collected the remains of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these primal dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the lizards split into their three most important developmental lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as "long necks" and their relatives, and the plants-eating Ornithischia (bird basin dinosaurs), which included the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus, for example.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is an original Theropode.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of airbags, such as the descendants of the Theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropode with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
According to this, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America over all parts of the earth, which at that time formed a single landmass as a supercontinent Pangäa.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa Hallae, found the remains of two other, not very closely related Theropods speaks for this.
The three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted picture, because in South America many primitive dinosaur fossils have simply been preserved, while on other continents hardly anything can be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile trunk to the dominant land vertebrates of the Middle Ages is still puzzling.
During the Triassic the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flight dinosaurs and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relatives died out on the border from the Triassic to the Jura.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but the other reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact caused a group of animals to bloom, which had also developed in the Triassic and since then a shadow existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto are on the list, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities all over Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarity with the protesting students on Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" the police operation initiated by the Presidium.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police commando".
The eviction was an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served "the deligitimization and criminalization of protest" and distracted from the content.
The Presidium had withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, they say.
Protest Legitimized
The youth of the Verdi union and the German Trade Union Confederation are also committed to solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hessen's science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We're grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbadener Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, according to CDU member Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Left saw this differently.
The CDU uses painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, one had cleared.
The Left has tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded site for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from Moscow center, is known as the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with Riedberg as a research location in Frankfurt - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several reciprocal visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, and Edwin Schwarz, the planning officer for Frankfurt, signed the contract.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the major companies Sitronics and Rossijskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally "Grünstadt") received its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart brake block
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the lowering of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital for a decade into unholy building site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headyards with tracks that end in the middle of the city were then regarded as 19th-century traffic-related fossils, which looked like brake blocks of modern rail transport, as it once took a great deal of time to span locomotives from rear to front.
Drive in, hold on, keep going - that's how it's supposed to go.
And that's why the head railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that's why the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and Bavarian cities to implement the lowering.
However, headyards no longer have an entry and exit problem since there are modern turn-around trains with traction vehicles and steering cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the new ICE construction line to Ulm are now being tackled.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railways are participating, also because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic are borne by taxpayers and not by the state-owned corporation.
The project can still be reasonably justified in terms of urban planning.
New urban space is created, which - if you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, to which - typical 80s - huge growth was attributed.
At that time there was not yet the competition of low-cost aircraft.
However, modern transport policy must first of all be about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport by truck.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains because of heavy gradients.
It is even more serious that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros will be buried in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts believe ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade the money will be missing from other nodes and narrow spots on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 km long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built in slow motion.
It would be urgently necessary to press the tube correctly here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley route becomes the bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden state parliament whether it will go against the verdict of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling examined legally, said Minister for Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On that day, the VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that, in the event of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt airport, the country would have to reorganise the night flight ban.
The registration of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided for by the state government, is incompatible with the legal protection of the population against nightly noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will go against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticised this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to renounce a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be regarded as a "word break".
It's damn hard to keep your word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said in allusion to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel that the state government is trying to get to their night flights with "right-wing twisting and trickery".
It takes time for an exact legal review.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a right-wing decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Just as it is the opposition, the statements of his faction on the night flight ban have never been.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-shattered U.S. major banks are stripping off their state shackles.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund totalling 45 billion dollars (a good 30 billion euros) in one go.
According to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC, the Citigroup is also planning to reimburse the state aid.
The institutions want to remove the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had received over $19 billion of fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum out of her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by division sales.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis explicitly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday night: The injection of money had helped over a very difficult time.
At the height of the financial crisis, the money house had faced up to the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also intends to raise money on the capital market to exempt itself from its liabilities to the State.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce a 20 billion dollar increase in its capital, reports CNBC, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Fast choice
Then everything went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors pushed the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the personality.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the station - officially, in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it may have also played a role not to further damage ZDF director Markus Schächter, should this proposal not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed on the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out in favour of Brender, seven voted against him. Brender’s election was a bitter defeat for Schachter, but one that could be expected.
After all, the majority of the Union on the Board of Directors had already signalled weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had been organized.
With the argument that the news broadcasts of ZDF had lost ratings under Brender, he refused another term of office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on ZDF was scourged.
Finally, even 35 state lawyers had intervened in the debate, who considered Koch’s actions unconstitutional.
It didn't do any good.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
He then worked at Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, initially to "heute-journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit following the election of Brender, which was voted Journalist of the Year on Wednesday by the industry journal Medium Magazin.
Koch's counterpart on the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF state contract in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also ruled out an extract of party politicians from the supervisory boards of ZDF.
Brender's likely successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever move - by severely criticizing the board immediately after the election.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both Schächter without losing his face for the post of editor-in-chief as well as the board of directors, without suspecting that he would be a party-goer.
In party arithmetic, Frey is anyway attributed to the left-liberals.
Studying Is Unbursted
Partial success for the students: After a year of the education strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally took a turn on Thursday: At a meeting of the Ministers of Culture and the Rectors of Higher Education, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the examination load: In principle, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students will be checked and "a realistic and justifiable measure" will be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master programmes more flexible.
In addition, there should be no derogating country rules.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Minister of Culture and University Rectors have carried the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of examinations in some cases drastically: "Each module usually concludes with only one examination", says a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially regulate the admission of study programmes.
With the "significant reduction of the audit burden", the accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm said, it should stop a "misdevelopment, which significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, the "studyability" should in future be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content are "strictly necessary to check" whether "unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of
It is also important to ensure that events are avoided.
The students would have "a claim to maintain room for manoeuvre that allows and encourages initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses, but also to the examination of existing ones.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it will take until 2015 until all the courses have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this nationwide, which are under the responsibility of the accreditation council set up by the countries.
In October, the ministers of culture urged the countries to "repressively" influence the agencies in such a way that the quantity of materials is not too large and the testing regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and colleges of applied sciences have already agreed on appropriate measures with the state ministries.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
From this money, the universities are to set up tutor programmes and strengthen student advice as well as examination and foreign offices.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act into the parliament.
After this, only one test is required to complete a study model.
The aim is to make study design more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master's degree.
By the end of next year, all of the country's degree programmes will be reviewed for their degreeability.
The government and opposition had again argued on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso University Groups demanded that the shaping of education policy no longer take place "in the back of closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
After the educational strikes at the latest, the students as affected should now also "talk a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Trade Union for Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough with the Bonn decisions as a whole: it demands a legal claim that allows every graduate with a Bachelor's degree to access a further Master's degree course.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that sufficient master's degree places with the best possible study conditions are available for the current generation of Bachelor students tomorrow, says GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to recruit significantly more lecturers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on a freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and from there is almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he caused considerable extra-literary attention during a conference in Munich, which focused on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its securitate acts".
Söllner left a statement in which he admitted his cooperation as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun gradually, first in 1971.
I'm, concluded Söllner, "so someone who hasn't resisted the securitate's intimidation attempts enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and defiance of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can tell, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate file IM Walter played a role, said the literary scholar Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter on him.
He had "cut it out" in all for him at that time difficult points, according to Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not entirely surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The people affected, one may assume, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to the now very process-proof sighting of the Stasi files in Germany, the handling of the remains of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic information has been misled and hindered.
A National Council for the processing of Securitate files (CNSAS) was established by the Birthler authority in 1999, but the publication of the files has been slow since then.
Only since 2005 is there a law governing the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very strong was confirmed by an interview following the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate boss from Temesvar spoke disparagingly about the prize winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as is so often the case with concealed guilt, is linked to inevitable questions.
Why now? Who has been harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the urge to know rather than by blame and shame.
With regard to the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just a neatly dressed field clerk coming from a very nice Christmas party, where a sporting goods manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier, climbed into a C-Class called for a quarter of an hour after midnight. ̈
The man with the striking baldness was chauffeured because of the still strange city.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - after all alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work is just going on.
Or just get going.
In the words of the Swiss, who was only three days earlier, "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is coming on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat in Mainz the royal class performance in the league everyday life.
And to put aside the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three gates by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16./17. + 23./24. February/ Rückspiele 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy of the Babbel successor's brilliant debut remained restrained.
Not only with the supposed healer, who had given the uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence, commitment and joy of playing in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to reflect on their strengths and encouraged them to be more courageous, Mental Clerk Gross explained the so simple-sounding recipe for success, which had no longer had any effect under therapist Babbel.
He has sparked a certain magic, admits Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, things sometimes happen that one would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamism, became the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new superior's way of working: "He is a man who is pervading and demanding discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel it had obviously lacked it.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports executive Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all Konstanz.
Like Gross, players and managers also protected themselves from overvaluing the victory against a completely overburdened defense of the Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen the evil awakening had come at 0:4, Khedira said to mind.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not ready to celebrate on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory in three months was due to the events of the weekend, which relived in the form of a television interview by goaltender Jens Lehmann immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown leadership weakness to the board and decided to change coaches on pressure from pulverizing fans.
Lehmann also considered that his day off after playing had been cancelled as a sign of lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann's statements were marked by "pure selfishness", Heldt keilt back and announced consequences for the final man.
I don't think you're gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
However, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the replaced trainer team, the playful and militantly strong performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big share in the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
WM-Fight in heavyweight
Hot duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to version of the WBC.
The judge's verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains heavyweight boxing champion.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the association WBC defeated the US-American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night in Bern.
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout everybody expected didn't work out.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give himself beaten due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2.02 meter-sized Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left leadership hand.
However, the eleven-centimeter-smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly escaped the World Champion's blows, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights to the goal decisively.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some vortex before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right."
In weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of time out, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
This year he defeated Chris Arreola from the USA in his title defenses Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September.
I got only one blow in this fight and am physically very well in shape, Klitschko had founded a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations VBO and IBF.
However, the belt of the WBA is worn by the British David Haye, who was able to dethron Nikolai Walujev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September in the summer.
It is said that his promotion company is already planning to fight Klitschko in Wembley Stadium in London.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has described defence minister Guttenberg as a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left demand clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on Kunduz's air raid, the opposition's Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has assumed a deliberate deception.
The Minister had said "knowingly the untruth" on the deadly bombing of two tanker trains in September, said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It's commonly called a lie.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about killing two Taliban leaders.
According to NATO, up to 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air raid requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately to the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the Intelligence Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Spokesman of the government Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not influence the concrete deployments of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the Ministry's presentation of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tank truck attack.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the background of the two top officials, it was reported that they had even referred to several reports from the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document by commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, it is said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the committee of inquiry of the Bundestag, which wants to constitute itself next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred not only in the mentally ill and in the drug rush.
As long as it happens in sleep, it's all right.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can indulge ourselves uninhibited in the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike conditions in growth, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, at least as a stranger.
But such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in the drug rush.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, delusion, and reality blur.
Dream-like altered waking states can occur in various forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of rapture, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messenger substances of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no more power over it
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of madness with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, illusions of such a kind".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity has no more power over him, it floats on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted frets, squeezing.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, knots them into a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a loudspeaker and lays the noose around his neck.
Jump.
The noose is loosening.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices screaming in a drum-skin-scrapping choir, "go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years old, the first is almost 20 years old.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, moreover he is manic-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric hospitals it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, megalomania, relationship or persecution.
Voice listening is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogize.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to separate important things from unimportant things, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a flood of ideas and fantasies that stem from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician of the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of the event, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is overwhelmed by the events, just like in a dream, and he cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenic patients therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
They are not usually able to compare reality, the illusions are cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place within the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still pose puzzles.
Exceptions can cause any human being to lose his or her reference to reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that minimal brain damage is present in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development by a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disorder of the neural system comes about, which, moreover, does not manifest itself for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also cause psychosis as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains run hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get them, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether false images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a question of viewpoint.
For ten years, Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions, and last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are one of the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of astonishingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and cranial brain trauma.
Surprisingly, even the brain of healthy people is hallucinated under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, says the box, are composed of memory contents that are normally held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also excitement, stress, heartbreak or other mental states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents said that they had experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the Gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
During the break it can happen that a shabby boy with long, dark hair speaks to it.
When it answers him, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening
Often the illusions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher is presenting a new student in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations for all the others, both audible and visible on the table.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and much too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees are the faces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her about it, they think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed her Abitur last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she made contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of despair
When a person is socially isolated or suffers from disincentives, he is most likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I guess the brain is then underworked and provides its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she found out at 13 that the man she calls Papa has not been her biological father since she could think.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations have the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K., to distinguish between illusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is taking place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, which is why they work so real."
Even nightly dream images evaluate caste as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their illusions as unreal.
Therefore, Kasten advises his patients to value hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our overly mind-centered world, imaginary experiences are mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also contains positive, creative delusion - delusion is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of dream-like altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experiencer considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state in hindsight.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with loss of self and world, for example, by persistent, total inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline between dream and hallucination.
Since coping with a situation in reality is not possible, a change of world takes place, but the real situation is visualized in imagination.
An intense form of sense and meaning in a situation that is in itself unbearable, which enables us humans to create our own ability not to sink into a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body in the intensive care unit is doomed to motionlessness.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who produce drugs from blood.
Swallowed by a Greek on a motorcycle to his home country, his hospital bed surfs in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes up completely in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travels are still overly clear to me after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other life-worldly experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug rush show how fragile our inner images of external reality are in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist caste, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The Snowfall Can Come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen is an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children in the long term, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have arranged the details for this as a precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only arises after that.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to have 7500 employees present their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company, too.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the Board of Directors from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member of Burda since 1999.
At first, he was responsible for technology.
Later, the Treasury division was responsible for corporate assets and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure, for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", according to Burda.
The holding company should continue to be 100 percent of the family, Burda said.
In view of the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from the downfall: "This always concerned families who could get infected by a capital addiction, which has completely speculated and thought that they could thus rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "never dreamed of world power," Burda said.
I do not see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the world league with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that's what El Corte Inglés has planned, who recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the mall in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves around personal care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, one finds among other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide a depilation with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that stands out through its teahouse with more than 130 different types of tea.
To enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner and at the same time have a fantastic view of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours to get your own "beauty party" with eight friends up and relax afterwards in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, and there are virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your workouts properly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are enough to train the body muscles.
And if you want to stop by the hair salon after you have trained your body, the Luis & Tachi company has a room where treatments for regaining the beauty, shine and health of your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this spa in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse cleavage
Christmas is getting closer and closer and therefore it is again a good opportunity to copy the looks of the stars and bring their party dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the cleavage, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage. You can only advise against it.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the project MOVELE is being developed to promote electric cars and to summarize the opinions and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those related to energy and, in particular, to its efficiency.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of electric cars.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesies the Spanish automobile industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of calm".
At the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the Prime Minister, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the government to support the automotive sector during the year of the government.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, today we would have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the president of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the plan for competitiveness, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The head of government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's efforts to boost demand, alluding to Plan 2000E, which is being used in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows for an average reduction of 6% in the exhaust emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in the number of registrations that increased by "40 percent" in November.
On 20.000 square meters of classic vehicles
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Classic Motor Show, an exhibition for experts and fans of the world of engines.
This fair will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
On an exhibition space of 20,000 square meters, 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands.
You can not only admire classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all imaginable articles in connection with the world of engines at ClassicAuto Madrid.
For example, exhibitors can find accessories, spare parts, components, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc. at the trade fair.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classic engines that will delight collectors and lovers.
Among the companies that will participate in this fair are among others Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, vehicle sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of automobiles, specializing in Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests in the outside area

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially designed race track in the outdoor area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental Sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sport is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, named i-Stop, on the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 stands out by its good marks in the overall picture.
The final processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, it can be seen that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
Further looking at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, you can see that Mazda is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the striking colors red and blue.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can easily be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of the German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers the appropriate comfort more than ever, so that four adults can travel comfortably by car.
All this comes with a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is currently only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gearshift.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out through its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gear switching and its low consumption, even if Mazda's diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test run is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the serial equipment stands out above all the assistant for the lane change (RVM), which thus eliminates the blind angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch rims.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learning-capable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its handling and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the tested model Sportive.
In return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving fun every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red teppitch of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, shined more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can read only your e-mails, without a possibility to see certain attachments or to surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is still of particular interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs only very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success of this, the company has launched two new devices: one intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free data service, in contrast to the Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, but it has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to do without all the data in order to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the country border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses in order to be able to read all the small print.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs means that telephone providers have to think slowly, but surely, and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and further inquiries on the Internet.
Without carry and without hook.
This is an Internet-enabled device, and you only pay for it once, when you buy it, and not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a shopping opportunity with lifelong internet access as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish colour of Michelle
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his second most important moment in his life, without a doubt: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow - the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same fabric, and she wore something large-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It even went so far that it seemed at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a changeable model, but golden.
Also the hairstyle was different every time: The hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, on the previous one she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fruitability and career of women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market as limited due to their maternity.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to set up a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if so, what kind of occupation they perform.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed employment contract, become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with fixed employment, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore also have fewer children.
"Women in the 35-49 age group with a fixed job only receive their first child on average 3.7 years after moving together, a figure which increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed job, who have taken longer to achieve this and who have only realized their moving together and the first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a great influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar regarding the readiness to conceive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women when marrying and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have a primary or higher education, were first mother on average with 25,1 or 32,1 respectively.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with a primary degree are already getting married and having their first child before their first permanent employment, the women with a middle or high school degree do it exactly the other way around and first look for a permanent employment and get married after it and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to his enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will thus become another famous figurehead as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
For the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicente
Manuel Vicente presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures by Fernando Vicente) to the three-part x-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-inducing genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks an affinity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicente does not save on horrors or enlightenments.
Apart from the fact that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the disastrous fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was cast into her spell by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of coming to heaven on the detour of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 summits in the world literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny guy.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and again other times he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams bear witness to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane cry that was screamed out from a bridge from that personality in Munich so that his echo echoed deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. He did this on a journey on which he fled from himself and begged posterity with a speech full of violence from the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and bed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I can finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these verses of Spencer: 'The sleep after the effort, / after the storm of the port, / the rest after the war, / after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on her between the azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
Not a single other case is known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was much greater than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What, then, did Benet intend to do if he did not bring Baroiah to Faulkner’s weapons?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man so that he could stand himself on this podium?"
Fig Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our district in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age ran beside her and our dog, our dog is a mixed animal, which we took from the shelter and which weighs only six kilos, and then from the blue they gave him two kicks and hurt him severely.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun should be with a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on a leash.
In addition, there is the suffocation that a woman who went for a leisurely walk got when she tried to reprove these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he might also do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will do anything at all and in order to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation at what has happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must happen in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies today announced.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of her commitment to road safety, which "includes far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming ever safer with each day" and further confirmed that, with other educational and informative actions, they also contribute to getting closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will in a first phase distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that, as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to the development of ever safer products, which must be one of their main objectives.
The sale of small trucks is increasing again
After almost two years, the car market for vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first growth ever after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac manufacturer association and the Ganvam dealership association.
However, these good figures are only to be taken with great caution at the moment, as the reference data used for the comparison of November 2008 are a particularly bad year of consumption, with a decrease of 60% over the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
A total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold since January, but this figure includes all the vehicles that make up the market for small vans: cars, pickups, vans, small vans and light vans/cars.
Furthermore, there are still the same storm clouds in the sky, which most affect demand, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, most of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100 % of all cases make the purchase with third-party financing, go.
For example, to these restrictions, which are the result of the credit institutions' turn-over, one has to include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to passenger cars, financial support for the purchase of a 2000E vehicle has helped little.
This plan, however, is not only for private individuals, but also for self-employed and small businesses, if they want to buy a van up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday Ganvam reminded us that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as of course also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Car Dealers Association predicts a similar year for 2010 to the previous one, for which it anticipates a sales failure (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock braking system and as it is now happening with the ESP stability control system, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergency situations must become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, and for the remaining vehicles a waiting period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many rear-end accidents due to their operation.
The function of the emergency braking assist is to apply more pressure to the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects on the brake pedal based on the braking strength carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not get to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thus reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assist.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents is expected to be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
When the driver reacts, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if it becomes necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assist exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it takes more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europa, wants the affected party to give its approval to every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision regarding the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which has the backing of the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more popularity.
In the absence of any agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which now only weighs 1,275 kilos.
In order to create such a thing, they first dispensed with the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent wall roof with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos alone; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioning again 13; moreover, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 liters, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing sporty Bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch rims again five saved.
Then, by abandoning the CDR-30 audio system, they had reached another six kilos less, and by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric, they had reached the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller highways of California, on mountain roads that were really very curvy.
With his driving behavior you can only give him the grade impeccable.
The reduction of his weight did not, however, in any way mean that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time now we have not tested such a small and light model, which at the same time gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles in a low gear in the required time, until we give him the orders to race, slow down, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything they tell him. The car does everything we tell him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can even increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used at the Panamera for the first time.
Acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing up or accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the highways on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole track, even though we found some of these curves ice at dawn and rolling splits in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultralight car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it is usually rather rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a boob friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetic line and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck rigidity as her bags of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Basquenia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many fancy players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an outstanding triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and thus came to first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed decisively to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Reds, who from the beginning took the lead on the scoreboard.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come to the field with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from Álava decided to play the inside of Barac and the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter already suggests that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage of the break, the game was not decided yet and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the fact that the "yellows" turned the rudder (50-49).
More Disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to get some air back and one of them suddenly saw the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that the scoreboard showed a calming distance of (54-67), which the host could beautify at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alavesen were posted in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their team did not and tried to give their team back strength by three points from the line (70-77).
Despite this, and despite the fact that Fouls had split, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended itself well and although the Israelis caught up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to give up the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the inner game, which made the victory easier for the Greeks.
The team from Malaga was not afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game in the first quarter, the Andalusians could start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the ereins Unicaja, even though the local team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show 22-20 in their favor in the 13th minute, the minute in which due to an action it almost came to a fight between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the Englishman Joel Freeland left due to an injury and the three self-induced mistakes of Carlos Jiménez leaving clear marks on the Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian foreman Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
It was impossible to catch up
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which despite its 19 losses proved superior and even managed to compensate for the difference of the game held in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn made the leadership within the group wavering.
Unicaja tried to ignore the many failures and departures of Scot Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31st minute, thanks to the lead and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope came again to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, since the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be slowed down.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give himself up and had to give the lead to Olympus.
How much should you earn because of your profile on Facebook?
Thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, Facebook users can now learn their salary, which they should earn because of their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can use a Facebook form to enter their profession, work experience, age and city where they work.
Just a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish employee "feels badly paid on average", explains the product manager, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spanish.
As a result, a truck driver has a net annual salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net each year; followed by the work of a salesman with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at her embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President who has been removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest, when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knew that he had to leave the embassy before that date, where he had found asylum since September 21st.
"He is aware that he will have to leave on January 27, as his mandate expires on that day and he will have to find a new place to stay."
The station also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the scheduled date: "My point of view is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, due to Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician who the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is not surprising at all, as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers are making decisions about a future that is inherently uncertain.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to free up liquidity at interest rates around zero, so that banks would buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are starting to spread some sand into the gear, as the BCE näc has already done with its annual auction, which is taking place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalize the private risks and the public debt was rising again.
The focus is now on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in differences between the eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain has so far hardly been affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of moral risk, who once again tried to create awareness among those responsible for global economic policy, for what they had caused, as they had slowed down the devastating effects of limiting loans to job losses, when they were supposed to have decided a new day of thankfulness.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirs in order to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was already foreseen earlier.
A government that hides public debt, elections and a new government that pulls together.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from failing to fulfil its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, thus allowing a euro Member State to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to include its citizens in the obligation to maintain the stability of state funds in the need for exceptional measures.
Yes, we are as expected ahead of an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some debauchery on too high amounts, that would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if European differences were to decrease and Spanish people were to increase further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
That of Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the preferred indicators here force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and to correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long service life despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "careful driving" is announced.

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy on the energy supply of Spain is being debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, which was followed by Rafael Villaseca, President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Galán gave the press some key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, by 2020 Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros and a further 60 billion from that date until 2030, subject to the condition that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international networks.
From 2020, the issue will change and one should increase performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to absorb carbon dioxide and, of course, in particular, renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the conditions of course by other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft budget for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not want to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them, this direction is clearly being pursued.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that decisions on investments should already be taken, even if they are long-term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework will have to be created in order to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for ground airport services, Swiss Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, on which no figures have yet been announced, is scheduled for five years.
On the other hand, yesterday Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol of cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to study energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for his first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in Brisbane, Australia, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city council wants the construction completed at the end of 2014.
After the administration opted for public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll booth management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly European construction companies, competing in the final phase.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second one, based in Italy, is one of the best civil engineering specialists.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues group, opposes the Acciona team.
The third and last consortium, which is in the short term, is called LBRJV, formed by the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises massive construction works and privatisations, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as it is only through the purchase of a local construction company that one gets access.
A strategy that the mentioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, have followed, and which still has to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, owner of the Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona places great importance on this geographical area for the sector in which it is already well known because of its activities as energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and is headed by the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The purpose of the underground toll line, which is supported by the Brisbane Infrastructure Department and called Northern Link, is to connect the western highway in Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass road (see map) over a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest way to reduce congestion on Brisbane's roads.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award of summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll route is to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, construction work is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the financing.
Brisbane is already a big business for Hochtief.
Australia is repeatedly awarding substantial contracts to Hochtief, which yesterday signed a contract with the government amounting to 154 million.
The subsidiary ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre optic cable through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-story construction project of the King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
Initial investment amounts to 75 million euros.
FCC receives contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has secured the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres in length for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had been awarded the contract for the construction of the extension of the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnelling.
Construction work is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and its implementation will last over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has ascribed the advertising and marketing services to the agency Sra for the next two years. Rushmore, the railway company informed, over a total of approximately three million euros annually.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that presented sch to this competition advertised by Renfe, of which 4 came into the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
Punishment of over 63 million for France Télécom for slowing down the competition.
France Télécom has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on the French competition regulator for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition for fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority that oversees the competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore fallen back again.
Application Trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company followed the example of other telephone providers and opened an application trading site on the Internet to increase revenues from transactions not resulting from the telephone connection.
In principle, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 for this site to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League game has contributed 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since the beginning.
The Champions League has developed since its inception in 1992 into a source of revenue for football clubs.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since won 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has allocated up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) who have participated in this event since it was founded in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and which, besides the AC Milan, is the only one who has won the trophy three times.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 took fifth place.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also received the most money by participating in the past Champoins League.
And even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to borrow money from the Champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, in contrast to four bie Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure that UEFA is applying.
In this financial year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenue of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying preliminary round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million through their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400.000 per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth final receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarter finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, compared to the second, who receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million fixed income.
Barça, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each television market.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
Yesterday, Nueva Rumasa Group leaked details of the offer of shares to acquire a ceiling of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which is paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this postponement.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18 % below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Group of Jeréz gives the shareholders a period of 15 days to notify their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV confirmed that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
At a close, the deposit would amount to 611,7 million, while the value of Sos is 254,27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
When trying to stay on the edge of possible offers of purchase and the legal squabbles of his ex-managers, the Jesús and Jaime Salazar brothers announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision by which she becomes the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairmanship of the group.
This is anything but free from polemics, because the company is involved in a court battle on suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million Sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will postpone further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar loan, the ex-advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) yesterday appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their purpose.
CNMV approves Paternina's public exclusion notice submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender submitted by the investment company Mer for Federico Paternina last October 9th.
The supervisory authority stated that it had approved this tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions complied with the laws in force and that the content of the explanatory supplement submitted, following the amendments of 2 December last, could be considered "sufficient".
CNMV also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,0008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which is 8.95 % of the capital of the company, which consists of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws in force.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of storms and accidents not only the car workshops earn
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an expert assesses the damage caused and the cost of the repair.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process them afterwards and to offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera group, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are made with their products.
The other two companies that compete with the tool market for peer review and reporting are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and motorisations have been introduced to the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes onto the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because every one of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the process proceeds quickly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park on the roads, it is over 99%.
In order to carry out documentation work and to produce databases, Audatex has eight distributed centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus to offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the price of a car.
The only company that informs about a leader about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex offers this offer not in Spain, but in the United States.
When looking through the products Audatex offers, it is easy to get an overview of the kind of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of which is AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
Apart from the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each report.
It is the most expensive for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly line, using the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for the specialist market, with which one can offer for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or obtaining information about the differences by brand and model.
It can be used, for example, to investigate how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and delivers digital images in the same way, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT expert opinion guide is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually in the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in 1966 in Germany and established in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The total turnover in the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the reference index Standard & Poor's.
Auctioning of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, Solera Autoonline bought a flatfom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer more services and value to its customers, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, consultants, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been unchecked may no longer drive on the roads, but certain parts which have not been damaged may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value may be re-registered, even if they have been deregistered after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives an estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of an estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older specialists, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the cost of working hours, extra charges or discounts, and after that he can have the estimate printed and passed on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the work schedule for the workshop does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
At present, Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that auto mechanics have long been waiting for, for example, because with it you can choose a door and then turn the picture completely around to look at the inside.
