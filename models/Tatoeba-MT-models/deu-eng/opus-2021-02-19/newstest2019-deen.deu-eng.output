Yeah, she wants to...
"Schöne Münchnerin" 2018!
In the afternoon another surprise awaits our candidates: they will not fight the romantic candlelight shooting before the MY SOLARIS alone, but at the side of Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, flirting, seducing - no easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchnerin"-candidates deliver during the shooting with people photographer Tuan and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting can be found in the video:
DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into conversation, that you also talk to him about why he obviously felt one or the other as stated in his statement", said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmower" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the months of debate over the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-times national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil would have continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and had also justified it by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that Özil was not ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "one leaves a team or changes a club, that one talks about it with his coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not come about so far".
Linz: Gartenhütte in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz fire brigade was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, there was danger in delay.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire debris to the extent absolutely necessary removed.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery plugged into the store at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What has led Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live as she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family who wants her to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of child trafficking.
For all this, she doesn't provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan is watching in the video, following the family along the street.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan slaps her face.
With tears, the actress affirms how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: "Mascot" has this task on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to be so close to asteroid Ryugu that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign tickers: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and the subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 people are reported to have died.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated and cut off areas of the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chief
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August, when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletro car manufacturer.
The U.S. stock market supervisor sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain CEO.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharply guarded - the congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already reached agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name doublings for years.
Now they've come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on it this Sunday - whether it is okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The not") - meant by Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents itself as an anti-system candidate and thus leads the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer of the Automotive Week industry journal.
In December 2017, Audi head Rupert Stadler, who was detained and on leave, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we achieved an important milestone in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's Volkswagen mother.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "engraved organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had adjourned a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values after the emission frauds have become known.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, heads the company as Acting Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Stimme".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for saloons such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations would already be available.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to the DFB-Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early on Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again to re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "advisable" if he did not "like to work on the future project" after the contract for the Football-EM 2024.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organiser Philipp Lahm will work in the DFB-Presidium.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then of course be invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future an international without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says, "the issue is important, we have to take care of it," this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration must work," said Grindel.
Take off correctly with a half-wise scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausages.
He won't tell me if I've replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won without problems with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
With 20 points, Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliner.
The international Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his mandatory game debut.
Ex-master Brose Bamberg won the mandatory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower at the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg pro Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New player Karim Jallow was the highest scorer in coach John Patrick's team with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings surpassed the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweigers, with whom NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the start of the season, were disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 race of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We'll protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne was partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were in action - among them also snipers.
The Islam Association of Ditib is in criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Schrecksekunde
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have been promoting more commitment in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in Central Park in New York.
"Commit wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival on the night of Sunday in front of around 600.000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a speck of horror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshot, scared, and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people ran confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organiser Hugh Evans.
However, New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read texts, photos and videos on the internet about the global fight against poverty and diseases and spread them further.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applauses from the audience - Buhrufe on the other hand for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He and his democratic colleague Chris Coons were in favour of more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, thus knocking many women out of their heads.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse to the point of attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, according to their own claims, had confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also come together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends journalist's expulsion
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had entered the front row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disruption of the press conference.
The journalist's action caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had arranged for personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are numerous journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities either: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested only at the beginning of September.
Most recently, the cases of detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials against them in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for its lively conversations at the bar of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests some beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing inlays.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Horniest Day".
However, the trip to the far north was not good for Munich.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled on it, the eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Directed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And leave the round of egg liqueurs that Ina throws at half past three, too.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips on how to fight the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish buns or - probably the most effective - headache pills.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller survived the nightly booze is not known yet.
But since she has been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and waste
The entrance to the 36 km long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa presents itself hard to find and littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Shrews, cigarette dumps, garbage and waste, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
A more than inglorious sight for the showpiece Bahnradweg in Rotkäppchenland.
The topic has occupied members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the bicycle traffic officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the cycling council.
There was no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the installation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also contributed the topic to the local advisory council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebrations on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but it also destroys: posts are torn out of the ground, trash cans are demolished, signs are crumpled, seats are smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions were only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is meeting place for drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also concerned about the new bike site in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe this sets the threshold significantly higher to attack common property.
However, this would require a police patrol to come by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße-Hügel.
He had to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany", said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa to be an extremely critical danger.
There's no trace of the Haaße Hill.
In busy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family reunion with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-standing albather living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, District Mayor Joachim Schmidt explained, was a novelty.
We have not yet experienced this in other parts of the city.
What were the lyricists connected to?
At the places the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly often mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about experiencing together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about her work.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he is also teaching guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke knew to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
Meanwhile, Alvin Jasic has placed a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others can listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Himig with his Hiltrup drummer, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children performed again in the finale - and even without electronic support sounded "rightly good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone is "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red slide - can only be deciphered once you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the maps, for example, it says from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Second window.
3. Dice.
==References==
These are the terms to be encoded from now on.
For here the concepts are not to be guessed, but codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that says maybe "3.4.2. "
In "Decrypto", the terms behind the secret film are not to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible does not; because this wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
So the encryptor writes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prague" because he has been paying attention at school and knows the window crash there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the terms of the opposite side - but it can be better combined with every hint given by the encryptor there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy should the conversions be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But those who have just started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre prime "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of few words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's just about guessing and not winning points, it's also easy to invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man occupied the police inspection Kulmbach twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed Hitler's greetings in the Upper City of a passing police patrol, later he also noticed in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must also be responsible for the use of trademarks of unconstitutional organisations.
Pressig plant was home to the Schubloks
For decades, the railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers banged on buffers, it was heard in all the press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons squeaked.
That was pure railroad.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its peak point in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres in altitude.
In order to cope with this, train and push locomotives were formerly needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, overhead line and railway mastery.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway operator for 47 years.
From the railway depot (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives were also operated for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and push locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Up to 1991, at least 10 000 weighings were still placed per month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were broken down, and in 1991 the rest were broken down.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not envisaged a better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport".
At Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were removed, the Pressig marshalling station was history.
"The rangers and insulators did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any misstep would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with kickoff success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing as Julia Görges had done before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzeva from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Victory led 6:3, 4:2 against Dariah Kassatkina, when the Russian woman placed at number 13 gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Pleasure", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the Special Opening "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Rund ums Walberla" in the context of the series "Art and Pleasure".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large crowd of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of the vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of artists in the past and have helped shape flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is again a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austänzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high support of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
While walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the estate, the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau awaits the visitor on the right.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object seems magically calm and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
On half way Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy image of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "wind play performance" to wander through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the period of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also breathed their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should no longer be Sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they launched the MGV 68 Albachten.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
On their own for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it was asked to dress festively had previously.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounter", but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was needed: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honor that the singers of the MGV 68 made the voice sound themselves.
Happy songs were announced for the occasion.
Almost set: "A day like this, as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice, which many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hop".
Once again, Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnbusch at the time, was the conductor of the choir.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece that he does." Incidentally, this time not only men presented themselves singing.
The ladies' choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds are intended to finance a visit to the Allwetterzoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd league Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascender is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring finds itself really well in league three.
No sign of shyness or fracks, the independents do their thing.
And this at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we already made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied trainer.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game checked out.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring this to the goal, such a game can already tip," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish line.
"We all know who's on the other side of a derby like that.
That doesn't break our necks.
I've seen really good volleyball at times," Annacker did not quarrel with the 0:3 - and immediately went on to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents goes, seems not foreseeable after just three days of playing.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one does he feel confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball." In any case, they no longer want to look down on the fourth league.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will arrive in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dreamship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly that the series might have had a complicity in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many colleagues I admired took notice of me at eye level," Keller explains in conversation with the "Picture on Sunday".
At first she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dreamship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time might have been quite jealous, but "like many men, Hans was also afraid of conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller had always tried to be "the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have misled myself", as she explains further.
She had always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman I was never really, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I sat in the dressing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively."
The moth, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little shy of light.
And the bright glow in which a green carpet is dipped in the six-lined square blinds him exceedingly.
But it's just a film festival, because more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he staggers over the square to make himself easier in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: The need institution on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason.
So get out here, across to the other side of the street: invited guests, who just entertained at the best level in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book", celebrate the festival start every year with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: The works shown come from the whole globe.
What you don't have to come up with in an article about this festival in order not to fall into sneak advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a volley around the antennae, which has put a good fairy on him, and two bully bouncers actually wave him in.
Inside, the invited people rush, they dance to live music far after midnight or let DJ rhythms dictate to each other, to which they yell at each other, and rinse down exquisite snacks with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement oysters wait for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain sprouts.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The moth studies the sign at the escalator: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If this is two separate instructions, he's got a misunderstanding in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry man tilts a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who's been advertising the brand for years, isn't here that night either.
But there, between local prominence, cash desk and kitchen items, a face that seems familiar to the observer passes by: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His lead actor shouldn't be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd with almost sixty almost like a choirboy.
He's not being talked to, he's not being yawned, he's being shuddered at the most.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as an embarrassment, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dancers
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to Cumbia rhythms with a player in the cabin, as can be seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
The second Mexican player defeated the Leones Negros with 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: League 1: ASV Sending after last-minute bust "destructed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "So a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destructed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we totally overslept", annoyed the ASV trainer.
At 8:1 the owners of the house, even the early time-out which Bieletzki had taken, did not produce fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
For the break, the gap was only two goals.
Especially Sending's best, Marius Hintze, hit another time in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst made the 15:15, followed by the relay changer.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then?
Intrude the impartial into what is happening.
Bieletzki usually avoids trying to blame others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well in the back against seven men and threw again and again on the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said Bieletzki, completely serving.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman Missed for 30 Years - Police digs for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday, operatives dug up a street near Marxgrün.
To this end, the road surface and several layers below it were removed, as police and prosecutor's office shared.
According to new evidence, the missing person may have been buried not far from their place of residence at the time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators didn't rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the prosecutor's office, has been working intensively again on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian monument protection authority, the investigators encountered an anomaly under the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows which dangers are lurking on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated character sequences, users should rather use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, also it does not harm to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. stock exchange supervisor, SEC, filed an out-of-court dispute over misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to lead listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla pay 20 million dollars each, and Musk gives up the position of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
He's allowed to stay on board.
In the settlement, which must be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads SpaceX, is the public face of the electric car pioneer who writes losses, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed in the complaint.
He had always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay $420 per share, the financing was secured.
Thus Tesla would have been valued at a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an external chairman, hire two independent board members, and set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.

Record champion Manchester United is slipping deeper and deeper into the crisis after the worst start of the season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United earning 1:3 (0:2) and remains only in the middle of the league with ten points after seven days of playing.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League match against FC Valencia on Tuesday.
The former Leverkusen goaltender Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League match at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday Manchester City won by goals of Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th) 2-0 against Brighton&Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used in the new leader.
"Let's Dance" juror Joachim Llambi and Mrs Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi probably broke up with his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhal content) reports on the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert, citing Llambi's lawyer.

Surveys: 46 percent don't want Merkel as chancellor by 2021
After the querels of the past weeks, GroKo collects several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one counter to 17 percent, the SPD drops a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose one meter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value so far for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would only receive 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
This means that the grand coalition has currently lost the majority of the Sunday question at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
Together, they received 53.4 percent in the 2017 Bundestag election.
Among the other parties, the range is also large: The AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the percentage of votes cast.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens find Merkel to be the right person in the Chancellor's office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS showed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) would like the grand coalition to hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, while 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, Merkel also saw significant losses in popularity.
The Germans also judge whether Merkel should again run for the CDU chairmanship in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
As a result, 64 per cent of Union supporters do not want to be candidates, 35 per cent do not want to be candidates.
Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic stories about getting to know each other - you should talk about turkey meat at Aldi's.
Munich - In times of the digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place to get to know people for the great love exudes almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short snacks at the table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less of a contact but rather a slippery stock market.
We dared the test: How do women react, you don't talk about the hot porridge for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood Lovestory potential is when the love happiness is preceded by an out-of-eyes-lost-and-found plot.
If the guy even gets in touch with his beloved at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and other varieties - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this advertisement in an Aldi branch unknown to us is quite to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
For her belief in the magic of analogue acquaintance, she definitely deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has been involved in the action "Deckel gegen Polio - 500 Deckel für eine Leben ohne polimitlung".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease called polio in German leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered to be eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be controlled by vaccination, as a press release states.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about form and fitness by Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn't do us any good," said Götze-friend Reus after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in negotiations with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a treaty yet.
There's no fixed date when we're gonna do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment where we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sunday evening in the TV station Sky.
Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
Wortkarg, coach of the football district club VfL Wolbeck, retired (inside) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
It's all history.
Meanwhile, it runs around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer proof is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only very thinly passed the ascent.
Yes, I'm very pleased with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," said Fetsch, praising his boys and visiting every individual for the match, simply to say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - from the 4-4-2 it went almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited on balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
This almost would have been revenged when the SCA struck in minute 41 twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker caste - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took the full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed scarcely.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes input.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed a fresh cell cure on the left side.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute of Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the placekeepers 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The fouled man himself started and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" Thing with the right flap hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1-0 (71.).
Twenty more minutes that should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the penalty room unlucky to the hand.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske still had the victory hit on the punch in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five match days - coach Adi Hütter could not do that.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home victory.
Stürmer Ante Rebic, who was in the starting team for the first time after an injury, was supposed to help with this.
Luca Torró, a midfielder, was back after a pubic injury and was to prevent the SGE from collecting further goals according to standards with his headball strength.

Helicopters crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingbrunn a drama occurred.
The landing of a helicopter caused turbulence, as confirmed by the police opposite oe24.
The heli was caught by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a standstill at the side.
The police, rescue and fire department were immediately notified.
With a large contingent, the forces came to the disaster site.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage to property.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigation.
According to firefighter Franz Resperger, there was a small fire that could be extinguished quickly.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of September 1st, as the report "The Power of Monoculture" shows, which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday and was presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
The small increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was also due solely to positive impulses from the medium-sized value index (MDax) companies.
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the Board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
At the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would not continue to undertake a voluntary commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: As of September 1, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If an equal number of women were recruited for the boards of directors each year, a share of 40 percent would have been achieved already in 2023," the report says.
Some even make mischief: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves best.
The Italians take in 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan is still valid today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros in operating profit with every car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, while Tesla and Bentley even put a lot on every car.
With prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros before interest and taxes, Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well on track for EBIT.

Torch procession to the opening of the 60th Abtswind Wine Festival
The tourist association opened its wine festival session in Abtswind with a torchlight procession.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which from now on rise every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on the Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, the people responsible went through the village to the festival square under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn.
The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already prom-full festival tent. "60 years of organizing something like this - this is an amazing achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of this," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Weinprinzessin Lisa II. later symbolically met the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found their way to Abtswind again." Later on, "Die Troglauer" caused the mood.
On Sunday, on which Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the drinks prices as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house, before going into the second round one day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: Emergency car crashes in taxi
An ambulance is badly damaged by a road.
A 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured in the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the event of a collision of an ambulance with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance car had hit a red traffic light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then bumped into a crossing with the taxi that was driving at Green.
The doctor's car hurled against a traffic light pole and a tree after the collision.
He captured the passer-by who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency personnel.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, investigate who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we find it uncomfortable
After the disgraceful end of the league cup, Manchester United is now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The way of defeat may still be to talk.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, when Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's defenders stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a previously already over long distances of insufficient performance.
The mood at United's Manchester City rival is very different at the moment.
The Citizens coached by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an approximate 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the defense bar of the outsider for the first time for the home team.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1:1 victory against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Like the Cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the Londoners.
The 27-year-old hit in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds had started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, with the remis in the league, the Blues Liverpool now fell from the top of the league.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, who played through Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defenseman Craig Cathcart unhappily played an input of Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal.
Thanks to the fifth consecutive victory, Arsenal passed Watford and is now just behind the big rival Tottenham in 5th place.A strong impression continues to be left by climbers Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and finished 8th.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show under the banner of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet ubiquitous: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their new products in the French capital together with the competition from all over the world.
The diesel doesn't really play a big role in this anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should still be an important topic at least behind the brilliant backdrops of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have among other things their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolstädter is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not scheduled to start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
During the severe earthquakes and the tsunami that followed, at least 380 people were killed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and traffic connections are damaged, and there has been enormous damage to property.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke in over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims will rise significantly.
So far, the figures are only from Palu.
However, numerous other municipalities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorrad-Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking with a team of helpers on Sunday.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) at Haus Nordhelle takes place on the last Sunday of a month.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a worship service that was far from ordinary.
Already from 10 o'clock the Bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first the biker's early stage was on the agenda and it was possible to strengthen itself with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given by priest Dirk Grzegorek during the Biker service.
The musical background was provided by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill rather beats poetic-quiet tones," says Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle worship yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big celebration: after the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active at the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also attracted great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his amazed spectators step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children were yet able to imagine how this would turn into a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important step this late Friday afternoon.
Wrapped in shapes and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little apple pieces, which look a little bit like chippings, layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
However, the farmer had already bottled specialities with him.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Also active of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games.
The home club will also offer a day of action next year.
Then, however, according to Gregor Krützkamp, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: finally, the milk will go around.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season broke: "Fucking situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals of Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, there was nothing positive about the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "Of course, that's disappointing, because you always do a lot of things."
The further victoryless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met for the connection, stand with two meters at the very bottom and are in their current constitution a candidate for descent.
Guided by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated its first home win in the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46.300 spectators, who advanced to the middle of the table with seven points after the successful general rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rom.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse during his debut in the start and never got a grip on Hanover's defenses.
With his speed and assertiveness, the striker, who was long beaten after the World Cup, showed why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was loaned by Liverpool FC, was also the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurter club, which began in a swing.
Lucas Torró's (17th) headball falsified on the goal net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense of the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back) who had failed in the short term.
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penitentiary after a corner was turned off, and Haller extended his head to the goal where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the defender who came in the summer from the French second division club AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt fell even before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who was able to refuel and 96 goaltender Michael Esser didn't stand a chance.
During the half-time Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played now a little more courageously forward, but sparking ideas remained until shortly before the end, when after all, still the connection hit succeeded.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After a short hour Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests only show running, also Jovic met one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter managed to reach millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14th or on Sunday after.
The feast service takes place in the town church, then there is a procession to the church of the Holy Cross with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, which dates from the 30-year-old war and is said to have been shot at by a Swedish soldier, according to legend.
Blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished to this day, only the altar room stands, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the Cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish, the divine service was poorly attended.
After the divine service the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final blessing the church part of the Feast of the Cross ended.
For many years the Catholic church choir then invites to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church, while Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been standing for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been determined, which was only possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The base plastering works are finished, before the winter the natural stone works are to be started and one hopes to finish more than half of these works this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new residence for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" is handed over to his destiny - all present were agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
More wide corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was put to the test for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had come into years and no longer modern in the equipment", explained Bader in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
The Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2,4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms.
For this too, Jürgen Heinz, Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, thanked him.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which let the inhabitants experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the Schwaben district, also said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile."
The homeliness and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this position is a real lucky case, because it is no longer to be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new dormitory on Münsterblickstraße offers space of almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, Deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to agree with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unit.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about one year old, reached their recipient on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to "facilitate the habitation" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion in the course of mutual rapprochement.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of commemoration, numerous new books have been published, which answer this question mostly in retrospect to the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, makes it quite different in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on October 1st.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to the technical work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not conjure up the "return to the work in hand".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the justified question of what is actually the difference between work and work, but be that it is.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its mandate - to govern - it should not be prevented from doing so now by debates on concepts.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and disgraces of the last few weeks may already be shown by Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the ruling parties come together for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly in order to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all this dispute.
First of all, however, issues of conflict are again on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the law on immigration of skilled workers.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange awards, while SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation for technical retrofitting of older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has shown a rapprochement over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned immigration law for skilled workers.
The SPD calls for a residence perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal has joined forces with GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Fighting's good.
Without dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not move forward.
In order to be constructive, however, dispute must not be re-enforced for party tactical reasons to the question of being or not being.
It's still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should fight - but always have in mind the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be solved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, that is what the People's Party must fight for now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the sights
Is the Minister of Labour violating the law on employment?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" their legists had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is astonished - it brings the matter now to Parliament via question.
She assumed "that the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and did not want to announce any violations of the applicable law of service in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to "acquit Hartinger from any suspicion".
Police tear up a street in search of women's oaks
Marxgrün - The police did not want to comment on this for a long time.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning is dug on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It happened that the investigators had previously set up an archeology dog.
The dog, which was specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to narrow down the relevant area to a few metres together with its guide in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian conservation authority in the area of the said street.
For more than a year now, the prosecutor's office and the criminal police court have been working on the missing persons case.
Time and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago Heike's body might have been buried here.
Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia annual day
On Monday, the controversial referendum on independence in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But already before that, there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked with paint powder by the supporters of independence, among other things, in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 police officers from the police units Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who were in action last year in the polling stations in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
At that time, violence had also taken place in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists would then have tried violently to break the police chain, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officials, among other things.
Six people had been arrested and 24 others had been slightly injured, according to the authorities.
On Monday, the Independence Referendum is celebrating its first anniversary.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians have also gone abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Aggregated perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split torlos
Red-White Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
==References====External links==*Official website
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, the final light and the third last, they turned out to be a congregated perplexity.
The first half was very manageable by the entertainment factor.
If you wanted to get a beer or a sausage, you could do this without worries.
There was no danger of missing a chance, because there was practically no chance.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal shot of the whole game, Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible in the 28th minute.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity, when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goaltender Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area border.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stormer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters aimed just above the housing and after one hour also the Gütersloher appeared for the first time offensively.
After a ball capture by Matthew Wieckowicz it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" the fast-paced counter over Sinan Aygün with a lapping shot in the arms of RWA gatekeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also played a head ball by Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, initially bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but it didn't bring anything.
Angelo Daut tried afterwards to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately the zero also stood in the front.
"This time we weren't as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede and that although our opponent didn't want to play here," stated RW Ahlens Interimtrainer.
Offensively, "everything was a little bit clumsy" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
I didn't have the feeling that we could get a back gate," Daut said.
However, to his regret, the audience did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Erntagsmarkt: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended, are pleased.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky was bright blue, but the place was still a little empty, but this should change during the day.
Because: "It's so nice and sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
The organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus greeted the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a neat pinch of humour as always.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice for the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed up against food.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creimers.
And the "replacement" did not let itself be taken away, in between musically to entertain the more and more increasing visitors.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is happy about the many active people with their stands, among them mainly clubs.
"Actually, there shouldn't be anything like a plaque," he thanked nevertheless for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals and the "Clean up" action that took place in September.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful paint - here something goes.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took the Maikranz with the help of the fire brigade and brought it to their winter quarters.
Many stalls worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his Dekupiersäge.
He had veneer work, beer lids with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more on offer.
Three Reckenfelder beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought with them by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The last one has a speciality.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
As little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricating with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate equipment
In Lengerich, unknown people did not promote the construction of a skate facility in a way that was hardly conducive.
According to Jürgen Kohne from the city administration, there are several suitable lubricating shops on request from the WN.
At least one case has been brought before the police for damage to property.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were displayed on signs at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro had already been discovered after the professional election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an Edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later this was again there, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case is given a special note by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without mentioning names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skate facilities.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the majority of the council voted in favour of the fire park.
However, this suggestion was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a building at this point.
A turnaround followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and financial committee voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then has the city council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Air traffic congestion is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the Air Traffic Control Union, the German Press Agency, before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures was the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic control services, for which there was no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for fully trained pilots has been wiped out.
Around a hundred people were missing in the Karlsruhe centre alone for surveillance of the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized the fact that several air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work consolidation and overtime, it won't work without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air traffic control agency.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot Miserere.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff savings in national air traffic control services are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not tighten the air even further off the air traffic control system".
At present, the EU targets would be agreed by 2024 and further tightening would be feared.
The EU was exposed to constant lobby pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs would change the way airlines thought.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", said Maas.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilot pupils each year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans for the restructuring of the Group.
According to the wishes of Thyssenkrupp interim director Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two resignations, the controlling body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50% stake in the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demonstrations of police and Catalan supporters of independence.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police officers and Catalan supporters of independence in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, some 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police had tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a large bid.
According to the forces, however, supporters of independence repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
According to the information, there were also ranges between the participants of the various protest marches.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to honor the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly one year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police of all people demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they beat us up a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to state his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who only did their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is for us to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona, because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Failed access to personal data British Minister
A security vulnerability in a mobile app has caused the personal data of ministers and representatives of the conservative British Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known one day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hannover police report a serious traffic accident on Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettenbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died driving their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The operatives are on site.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star-stormer "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to the three goal templates from Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early backlog by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst chaser for the time being.
The goal hunter, who was picked up by Real Madrid, first placed former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by headball, also did the preliminary work on the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who just had to slide in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve shooter is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the previous seven years already has six points advantage on Naples.
==References====External links==*BDFutbol profile*Butbolme profile*Butbolme profile*Butbolme profile*Butbolme profile
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to get off the course after too hard on Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national player has prevailed in Juve.
==References====External links==*FIFA profile*FIFA profile
The midfield player also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the square in the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is locked for the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre performance, rapper Kanye West has attracted attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused the audience to frown and question marks.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From then on, let's just call him "Ye," according to the musician.
"The essence that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you," says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
We did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
This was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more grippy, we have hardly ever put him before problems". Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar bullets reads thinly.
Gradually two goals in 90 minutes, so only rarely games can be made positive.
Football district league A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, but the first took advantage of Maik Krause from a sharp angle for the early lead (7.).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preliminary work by Krause he changed his position.
The hosts only had a double opportunity when Moritz Höne at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher first failed and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forgave.
A commercial meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
It was only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line that the match was decided (81.).
"We had criticized ourselves hard before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," Florian Kraus concluded.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Gates: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't even know what to think about it," he wrestled for words.
"We didn't get any access to them at all." With these he meant probably the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kroeger, but also all the other green-whites, who noticed with a collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and pulling from then on his players, however, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class preservation.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we hold against one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
All the more bitter is the fact that one must now go home empty-handed.
Top goal hunter Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th goal in the lead (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2-0 he laid over the left side exemplary for Fabian Frohning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"That was already madness, what he did", Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent without envy.
Shortly before the change of sides his own eleven made the balance: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhalter Hinkerohe through the long toreck (45th).
After the change of sides, it was again McGill who scored the balance (59.).
Then we went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nubel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann looked like (69th).
Despite the overnumber, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Gates: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th/Albachts).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: All of Dynamo Dresden's Presidium resigned
According to media reports, the entire executive committee of football second league player Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media called for a joint letter from the Saxony committee in the evening.
At first there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is supposed to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled his intention to pick up the tolerance prize personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: As Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
Thus, Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors were already with us". However, the fact that celebrities repeatedly show up at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective.On 29 September, writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also agreed to receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is written in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without a limit".
Weapons dealings, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks every humane idea".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitalization.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "Free democracy needs places where civil society can come together to seek solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200th.
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits some more visitors of the direction of capitalism criticism, others rather a tendency "from the left to the center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100% neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"For adults as well as for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner embraced gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
This is on the one hand the male sparring partner, who sometimes also comes to the conclusion of the sentence to speak, on the other hand a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies so congenially harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, in the same way as it suited the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought into play a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes if he has a partner, but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, would be of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have emerged from Mozart's composition if "the Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wounden" into the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk may remain CEO of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, but must give up the chairmanship of the board of directors.
Musk also agreed with the US stock exchange supervisor SEC to pay a double-digit million penalty, as reported by the SEC.
Background is Musk's surprising announcement of August to take Tesla off the stock market.
In its complaint, the SEC accused Musk of having provided false and misleading information.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police adjusted the number of victims slightly downwards.
Ten passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
Everyone has been released from the hospital by now.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night to observe.
He was released during the day, said a police spokesman.
The reason for the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus crashed head-on against a guardrail.
Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener women had problems mainly with the third division player Carolin Stallmann, who alone scored ten goals.
"Actually I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry about the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the final made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end a lag behind, lying at the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only towards the end did the wider bank of the hostesses make itself decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu set back room Merle Klement on the left, who then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd league women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd Liga West.
==References====External links==*FIFA profile*FIFA profile
"This was a huge step for a cool season.
It's Lenz's turn to play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked this out," said coach Dominik Münch, delighted after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the downfall of the table leader.
The first passage was dominated by the guests almost at will.
About 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice-champion of the previous year at 25:15.
Food took in the two-bar, but it didn't come into play.
We've kept her busy.
Our opponent has struck with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has switched the assumption to triple bars.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food sucked in, and we got a little lulled in," Münch continues.
At 18:17 the women from the Ruhr had the first advantage.
While Ostbevern was still fighting four set balls in the 19:24, his fifth attempt found his goal.
"The game was now a class better," the instructor found at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly there".
About 7:3 and 15:13 brought the blue and white passage four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dirtmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left a pile of pieces in the German-Turkish relationship that can only be tediously brought together," said Gökay Sofuoglu, TGD Chairman, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the opportunity for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of highlighting Muslims' affiliation to Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The widespread exclusion of the German public had "reinforced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the home club Nottuln is already organizing its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the day exactly it is then a year ago that we have carried out for the first time a Folktreff.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting would be held in Nottuln so quickly.
No matter if Storm Deep Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"As always, the program at the next Folktreff is a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites his friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer agreed to the first Folktreff "birthday" with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folktreff remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" inspired the audience and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend once again a sociable and humorous evening", it says in the invitation of the home club.
If you play an instrument and want to actively participate, you are invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always occupied quickly, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on the way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
As a result, the multi-billion-dollar merger is still subject to permits in South Korea and - as the largest hurdle - in the USA.
At the end of the day, the chances of an inside consent had improved, according to an insider, because Linde has promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and regional care was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, the last impulses for the foundation of the Kulmbach District Association for Horticulture and Regional Care were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
At that time, however, it was called "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (Kulmbach Town and Land District Building Association) and was founded by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the orchard association also differed from today's work - it was actually about fruit growing, about flowers and horticulture nobody thought at that time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees were to line highways, and so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But this does not mean that the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play an equally important role, as do the transfer of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulfläßen" showed entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with Smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added Söllner, underlining the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt about it, the district managing director and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He guided the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a lecture on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, and for the winter it was ingested.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has survived, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it", the expert pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
That is why the horticultural associations are encouraged not to give up so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian Association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, who was solemnly framed by the tower brass of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister shifts UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they provide both trading partners with an ultimatum for agreement.
Canada’s Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of time in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will speak only on Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman, Adam Austen, announced.
In the meantime, she focuses on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the United States.
The United States and Mexico agreed on a new version of the Nafta regional free trade agreement in August.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks on a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are to be brought to a conclusion, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-designate Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
At the beginning of September, the politician had been attacked on an open street during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people in several Brazilian cities took to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's organizations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations mobilized against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally of the Brazilian Workers Party (PT) presidential candidate Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore cannot run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As ex-mayor of São Paulo, Haddad has been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in politics, it is now presented as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a runoff election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully - no matter who he is competing against.
Bolsonaro is known for incitement against homosexuals and blacks and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's leftist workers' party should be shot.
Europe gets Ryder Cup title back
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, the European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale at the gates of Paris.
The outsider team of Captain Thomas Björn dethroned the favored defending champion USA for a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days in the Le Golf National with great punches and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen reported on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children at the deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become acquainted with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music stars such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's dissolution in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared at the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark in 2010.
Rocknacht in der Schuhfabrik: Volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock of three bands with another friend.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert start, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of stage fright.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - and their bands excite the 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening with the latest unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage the band dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "Zube" call is not to be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not the same as hard rock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock from the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates by the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuchen has gained a special reputation since it was founded in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its appearances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China from 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
In collaboration with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an exhilarated solo while he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of such a hard rock concert. According to the mixing console team, the "Mint Mosquito" rock night is about 98 decibels at the three-way concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition".
This is for example at press hammer level, but is thus still clearly below the controls of the "wacken fesitval", to the "The Ignition" on their website.
The Ahlen audience doesn't need 120 decibels in jet drive volume as usual in the north of the republic, however, on this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking Gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and set off a concert evening with the power of a tiger", all three groups, of course in a figurative sense, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim/Essen airport.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed in the parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a one-seater.
The plane had already arrived at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance from a tent on the airport grounds.
But there has been an Oktoberfest since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr districts and directly at the driveway to Highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at major events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US president of North Korea Kim, despite the nuclear crisis, is quite well-advised.
But now Trump has made a real declaration of love for his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's beautiful letters.
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in public on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia Trump found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although he proves to be quite tough in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, so was he, and we went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection had also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even if critics see little more than lip service.
The US president seemed to be quite aware that the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - according to Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be common to everyone.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of his appearance in a large sports hall in Wheeling right away: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It's so impresidial.
But he doesn't care very much, Trump explained, and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I always told you, it's so easy to be presidential."
But then out there, there wouldn't be 10,000 people pushing into that bulging arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric and on top of that spoiled by sun full: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair Baesweilers downtown has cleaned up on Sunday.

Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya with the help of a mobile phone video and thus made their rescue possible.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under life risk and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya while trying to get to Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger of death according to his own statement.
One of his comrades was beaten almost to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the detention conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year with the help of the programme, said Jorge Galindo, the IOM spokesman in the West African country.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a phone video call.
International organisations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher contacted the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot be said yet.
Description of perpetrator: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.
Please inform the Obernberg Police Inspectorate at the Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in Central Franconia after driving the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and released the missing person since Tuesday night, the police reported on Sunday.
According to the figures, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home now.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride in his off-road vehicle across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the whereabouts of the man remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statements.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Cologne airport.
This concerns above all the waves of arrest, press and religious freedom.
He had therefore "made it clear at Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this".
Laschet also reportedly referred to the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
He said that Erdogan had once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense's readiness to fly at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the owners of the castle had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to be accepted.
North Korea's Secretary of State, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions during the UN general debate.
"The recent stalemate comes from the US relying on coercive measures that are deadly for confidence building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
That punishment measures could force North Korea to "knee" is "a dream of people who don't know us."
In order to build trust, however, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, there had been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing the United Nations for strict compliance with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June Trump had met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is to return to Pyongyang for talks on ending the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting place, of which the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing: White blankets and floral decoration on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so everyone took part.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"It's no better for cooks," one visitor praised, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," stressed Rev. Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammern with card tricks and other tricks made for astonishment.
Jürgen Sator leaves the Land Executive Committee NRW of the Tafel
The head of the Essen Table, Jörg Sartor, has left his post in the Landesverband out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks.
Sartor had become widely known because the Essener Tafel had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-chairman of the NRW-Tafeln, said Sartor of the "Welt am Sonntag".
I've got too many in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Land Association of Tables NRW, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy to the dpa.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essener Tafel did it."
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday" Sartor again criticized criticism of colleagues from other tablets.
One should not follow the approach, "without us the people in the city are starving".
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm being told too much sweet stuff," he said.
There are all those social fuzzies who criticized me so much at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Fußball, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after behind - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2-0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home match against the TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
The TV Heuchlingen is quite different: In Kirchheim the TVH quickly got behind with 0:1, but after 90 minutes won with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to win with a 3-0
Gladbach playful two-time guided tour - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play twice a lead.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Four times in the first five league matches Schalke has maneuvered into the far side with early goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it took the first place behind the Bayern in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home equipe in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Evgeni Konopljanka by head, in the ensuing the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback Borussia Dortmund greets again from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had traded a 0:2 reserve against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to the 4-2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) balanced with a doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break with another doublette in the final phase (86th/94).
VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
Due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, Werder Bremen was already decimated before the break.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler created a curious entry-owner, which helped the guests to balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a two-time lead, ultimately played 2:2 and have been waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's balance to the 1:1 with his second Federal Ligator.
Yann Sommer was powerless at the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, as was the second match after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa proves to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
The French record purchase made by OGC Nice met Wolfsburg for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven laps, Gladbach finished 4th.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen against the VfB Stuttgart maneuvered into an uncomfortable situation.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart-based team, which the ex-Luganese Anastasios Donis finished with his first goal of the season.After 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serbe cashed in against Daniel Didavi Gelb-Rot after a jersey suit.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremens back into the game through a curious throw-in goal (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarter back to the Siegesstrasse.
Nürnberg won the Duel against Düsseldorf 3-0.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already brought the home team on course using foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens are voting today on whether the name of their country should be changed in northern Macedonia.
In a yes, the almost three decades-long conflict with Greece’s neighbour could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and had blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three retired women and injured them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted at around 10 p.m. on Friday in the escape street in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went after passers-by with fists clenched and tried to attack them, about his behaviour.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officers.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists on Währinger Straße shortly before at a tram stop.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered haematoma, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "from a still unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored continuously during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously said of the "image" newspaper that a registered partnership had not come into question for them.
"If we get married, it's right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with a rage on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Before that, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with regard to adoption rights.
Garden day: 400 meter hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the citizens' association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
Because around 400 meters hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Association of Citizens.
And it has also accumulated a lot.
Because of the hot summer, we're late this time, but fortunately it's just a shape cut now.
Because already in the spring the hedge had been shorn before.
The breakfast always following the work has also a long tradition.
"Everyone should also be able to keep up their strength," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canoeslalom World Championships
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the end of the World Canoe Lalom Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old took a perfect run on the Olympic circuit on Sunday.
Two years ago he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had already enough rides here on the grounds and it all worked out today," said the Olympic third of London 2012.
At the finish, he threw his paddle away with joy and stretched both arms safely up - knowing well that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had takeoff number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec was second in front of the Russian Pavel Eigel.
Police inspector Gauting reports the first attempt to break into a single-family house this fall.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of again.
So yesterday the police inspector Gauting reported the first attempt to break in this autumn.
The fact that it remained in the attempt at the single family house on Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them so much that they took the escape without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Broke at Hertha: caught up with reality: Bavaria challenged against Ajax
The award is unbeatable: FC Bayern "does not want to let down" the defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate conclusion for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small performance dell under the new coach Niko Kovac is not meant to increase to the greater autumn low for the Munichers.
"One week ago, it seemed like we were invincible.
Now the reality has caught up with us a bit", Thomas Müller noted after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
If you know us, you know that this really upsets us and that's why we're gasping towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year away no goal was scored, as at the same time of the preseason two mandatory games in series without victory, the table lead in the football Bundesliga initially lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last seeming overpowering Bavaria must be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," Kovac emphasized.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city and pushed his first defeat as Munich coach only to the once again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first intermediate conclusion of his term of office positive before the international season break - otherwise the tone will probably intensify.
Kovac did not take any extraordinary action before the second appearance of the season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second pre-round match against Ajax begins as planned, which had also won AEK Athens with 3-0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again", announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke in particular plain text.
The defender appeared in the role as Mahner.
"I don't think this is all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes in the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern were already behind Dortmund with five points, which has now taken the lead again with a point advantage.
And so Kimmich said at least positively with a wink that the public debate about supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious accusations.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent dispute between Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the causa in the ZDF "Sportsstudio" in Mainz.
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U-teams - that this does not happen again", said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they let themselves be photographed with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Frankly, as their president, I couldn't digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil after the World Cup affair, which had begun with Erdogan's photos, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced his intention to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for a return of Özil to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer will now be appointed alongside the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says, "The issue is important, we have to take care of it," this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old constructs three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Friday.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personal details, as the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report about a driver who had left the road and driven against a guard post.
At that point, the man did not want a local police force and then drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has gone to his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and has rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made an impression and couldn't remember much more.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 volunteers are still in action.
Around four weeks after the eruption of the bog fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still working on the extinguishing work.
That's what the Bundeswehr told us on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop in a stable manner, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it is said.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was proclaimed a week earlier on September 21st, because it had been feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements by wind and spark flight.
Thursday then it was said that an attack of the fire on neighboring communities would no longer threaten.
At times, more than 1500 volunteers tried to control the large fire on site.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for October 2nd and 5th.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand had for a time moved up to a hundred kilometers far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously said of the "image" newspaper that a registered partnership had not come into question for them.
If we're getting married, it's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with a rage on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Before that, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with regard to adoption rights.
Referendum on new state names started in Macedonia
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the same name, the neighbour Greece.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens had for almost three decades blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the starting signal for their country's western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have been 90 years old on 30 September.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner of 1986 dies in the USA in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasises.
(dpa) Switzerland will start an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs - as in Germany - can only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasises.
According to Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation, 15 percent of Swiss people are expected to have a donor card.
But only in five percent of cases a card is found at the decisive moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the family members do not know the wishes of the deceased.
"You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Ever.
A similar registration system is already in place in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as Marita Völker-Albert, spokeswoman of the Federal Agency for Health Education, says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - per organ donation or contra organ donation," she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be regarded as an organ donor, unless he or she disagreed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head arithmetic
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in head arithmetic.
He prevailed in Wolfsburg on the weekend against 39 competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, shared this on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retired from France, as main referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks included: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were already two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
Organiser Laue can hardly start with concepts like superbrain, genius or prodigy.
"Head count can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stage-oriented computational competitions.
One of the disciplines is, for example, the square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks, for which they have to find a solution strategy quickly.
Here, too, the Germans have good chances, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage, because early in childhood, brain calculations are learned more intensively and with other effective methods.
Intrusive Appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis Ace Serena Williams shows herself from her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to point out breast cancer and to fight for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
Emergency surgery has been initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "Symbols Act" in review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist groups or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Next week, Ms. Holle shakes out her beds for the first time in the West: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, they said.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become therefore wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday.
The unique "green ramparts" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the low forest state for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree and shrub hedges are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the Nature Conservation Association Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the basis of an order from the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates back to that time: by "turning around" the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North and Baltic Seas and give the picture of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by some 7000 animal species as a replacement habitat.
Up to 1800 species could live in one kilometre of kink and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise it loses to a light tree row, which loses besides the biodiversity also the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Knickpflege may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about local situation
In an interview with the German Editorial Network (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta at the time on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport on Palu was closed at that time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stop in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people steal some food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, some of the prisoners walk around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still a lot of bodies around, many people have not been found yet and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island going?
Right now we have cell phone reception, but before that didn't work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people who do not know if they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but, for example, at work.
Tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the clear came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi lying on the Pacific ring of fire not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must forego Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
On Saturday, Aogo pulled a muscle fiber crack in the rear left thigh in the 2:1 against Werder Bremen, the Bundesliga football team announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle mass rupture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss games after the following season.
VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast of downtime.
A muscle bundle rupture usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber rupture usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the Film Festival of San Sebastián closes annually the parade of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the songs on the cinema, one can sum up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions of recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire department tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action took place for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - walkers on Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the water station area.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the forces over and over again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a fireman with a hearty grip.
The duck injured on the chest was then taken to the LMU animal clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But, according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aims at World Championship medal
==References====External links==* Official website
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up on the missed precious metal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the close to grasp medal.
In the end, seven tenths of a second were missing on bronze.
"I deliberately took time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a big event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to strike.
The World Cup trail in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I've already taken the track into my heart", he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) on second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: Turbotempo FBI investigation
Time is extremely short and the number of interviews planned is very limited.
With a turbo-tempo FBI investigation, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was disputed over coercion charges.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The most recent turning point in the drama of Kavanaugh's vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer ran angry Tirades against the opposition democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the erzkonservative judge at the Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his initial announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still described the heavy preliminaries on Thursday as "beschiss", initially abstained from further attacks against the women and spoke on the contrary of "luck in misfortune".
In this way, final doubts could be removed, he said.
Later Trump attacked the Democrats in an election rally because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One would specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, that's all, said a government representative to the Wall Street Journal: "They're not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar of the municipality of Ried, installed in a "civil vehicle" for monitoring the speed limit, will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1st.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: the fear was felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first victory in the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and lots of balls in our penalty room," said Schalke 04's sports board - and breathed up.
After all, the Königsblauen had succeeded in bringing the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under control.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playfully and from pressing", obviously played with increasing playing time more and more the head played a role.
It's not really a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore kept retreating.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"All of us have fallen from the heart of a huge stone," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man creates."
But in the end, all that matters is victory.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also with Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the initial phase with a powerful start and make a fireworks display of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest drawback of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a trembling victory," said Tedesco: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke wasn't to be missed.
From around two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzach Valley observed a fire on Sunday around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon discovered by the police and the fire department: an unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two-square-metre area at Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it seemed that he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the embers unattended.
And that's near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling out and deleting.
The police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild for the second time.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani gets into the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic intelligibly.
With a lot of gestures, tangible figures and one or the other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflict-laden topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, and first-generation migrants sit at the Katzentisch.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to come to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflict.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one is politically right-wing or left-wing, but: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, then more and more lively starts the discussion round.
And there's a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands before us, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the following signing session he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, was intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first match day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen defeated the Central German BC in a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46).
The ambitious Bonners won 86:79 (49:47) at the BG Göttingen.
After the 112:55-Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena, Alba Berlin is the first leader of the season.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former serial champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday for a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the properties in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices, similar to the former local model, has been completed.
A good 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
"Currently the documents are checked", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Mayor of Pliening, the aim is to have the candidate ranking for the 20 plots drawn up by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
The award could then be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses, each with an estimated eight residential units.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and roads are to be paved soon.
A single plot as well as two of the apartment houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented dwellings supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated is the area of the new Landsham-South residential area created for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start for the construction of a day care centre takes place there.
There will be three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Thus Schalke's Naldo "big sport" succeeds also on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting team: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalker starting team for the third time in a row, but on the replacement bench, the understanding would have been great with many people, if the almost two meter tall Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But as the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his pros, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for convenience, stepped in and said, "We have to thank coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reservist existence, was not grudged.
Probably, Naldo knows, who was celebrated last season as the best Schalker, that he did not really get on the parking track with his coach - but for good reasons he gets a break.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco told me about the moment he said to Naldo that he wasn't in the starting team.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can take a breath right now.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that last also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself to be an exemplary team player at the bank as well.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its decline in August compared to the eurozone.
The purchasing manager index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute reported on Monday on its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, which means that the index is still below the 50-point mark for the 13th consecutive month, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as strongly as since November 2011.
The companies therefore removed jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also declined more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial enterprises.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, stocks and prices are being raised.
Tuchels PSG team succeeds eighth victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel hurries with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship further from victory to victory.
In the OGC Nice the defending champion won 3-0 (1:0) thanks to two hits by Superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league match.
Most recently, in France, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season 82 years ago.
After 22 minutes in the lead, Brazilian Neymar brought PSG into the lead and produced the final score in the postseason.
==References====External links==* Official website
Paris also won the dress rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the season, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory defeat this season at the 2:3 in Liverpool.
