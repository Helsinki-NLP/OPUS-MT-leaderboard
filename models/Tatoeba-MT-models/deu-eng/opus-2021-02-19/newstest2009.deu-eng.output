The Prague Stock Exchange crashes into the minus at the close of business.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
At the beginning of Tuesday's business, the Prague Stock Exchange followed Monday's slump by a further six percentage points.
This time the reason for the break-in was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market’s response to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there, is evident.
Case of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, stocks on the stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic event, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index lost almost four percentage points in the course of the business day, but was later able to offset some of the losses, resulting in a decrease of about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observes the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, and the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
"The timing of the bailout in the US is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese Central Bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft financial support.
Otherwise, it would threaten that other countries would also be affected by the break-in.
A Bloodbath of American Stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush's request to support the plan.
Bush believes that the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilise the entire economy.
The American stocks were in a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest slump in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, and a similar slump was most recently recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not get through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concession: US government may pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
American legislators made a breakthrough in discussions on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance to the American financial system to the tune of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner).
However, this does not mean victory.
In fact, Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to different data, the Senate could probably vote on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first major psychological factor in stimulating financial markets.
After that, however, there would be a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms, as one could also help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a market stabilization package should look like," said the Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the agency Bloomberg.
According to her, a final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with U.S. Secretary of State Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which plunge the financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
The recovery plan needs to be continued further, but I think we are at our goal," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
This is to reassure investors of Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision by the Congress could influence business on Monday.
So far, however, it has not been quite clear when both US Congressional Chambers will vote on the law, nor is there any clarity as to whether the negotiations could still fail at the last minute due to a problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will undergo some changes.
The total amount earmarked for assistance to the system will be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
But Congress can block the distribution of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, at a further $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush values progress in negotiations positively
Although the president has a right of veto in this decision, Congress can overrule its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained, based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush was also pleased with the progress made.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "estimated the two-sided effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the banking committee of the Senate, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed on responsibility for the money program, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the programme and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
This is to be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard to achieve this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new mortgage rates that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to Patria Finance's chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"This is because one does not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses among each other," Marek told the iHNed.cz server this week.
According to Marek, whether the plan is being adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive.
"It is much more important for Congressmen to agree to support the plan and to say goodbye to it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on adoption is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Duel on Messer's cutting edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls yet.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to buy just one phone.
Despite all this, there are enough reasons why you should get an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
It's hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on your shelf, you probably dream of at least one of them.
This is also the case with music on travels, i.e. with compressed music, expressed in a simplified way - music in MP3 format.
Again, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand kroner on a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan will hardly be able to handle headphones for twenty kroner from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don't even create a hint.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and simsing, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better camera, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no television.
But the universality of mobile phones also entails disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
That's why you should expect the cheap phones to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you then make calls from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good will last at least 9 hours continuous operation with one time charging out.
Another problem is if you want to play the music on your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB connection, besides, not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones without any reduction.
With players you do not need special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, sorted by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and of course also the ease of use.
If music is the setting for you and if you listen to it every day only briefly, for example, in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which almost every cell phone can do.
You don't have to check which music formats a mobile phone or player can process.
MP3 will create all, and most of the music you get will just be in this format.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can in itself be a powerful argument for why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the phone with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can access the built-in speaker, which almost every mobile phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of the music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand kroner.
For three and four thousand kroner, you'll already get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand kroner.
The advantage of the players in turn lies in the easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - players can really be used by everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity when operating with the formerly normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no danger of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous invoice for data transmissions.
Which device should you reach for now?
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g.Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But respect.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be one of the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control knobs for MP3, and the ease of use comes to that of a single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players, is the furthest.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kroner, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) afford MP3 players from the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and the Czech suppliers offer practically all the services offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe he won't be waiting for long.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the ČTÚ telecommunications authority, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the European Commission's final steps in regulating roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a battle announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that there is an extremely high level of competition on the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák often agrees with this, who in the past had often said that there was no place for another supplier in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has much chance (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is one more possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market brought with it a significant price reduction, to which then also the classical mobile phone providers had to react.
Even before such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, there were similar voices to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, it doesn't take long to look for examples.
In February we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers, making it the fifth largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking stands the financial group Penta, which owns among other things U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be able to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually stand out as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a rather good move to focus on a non-clichee target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and who they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also gain a foothold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone Miroslav Čepický's press spokesman also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of service provision."
In the Czech Republic, mobile operators feel that there is no chance
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region," says Jana Studničková, press officer of the Penta financial group, in a telephone call for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Their interest in launching a virtual mobile provider has been demonstrated for a long time by the GTS Novera group, which wants to take a further step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area of corporate clients.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network services, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to achieve progress in negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, press officer.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Unofficial information suggests that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specificities compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area", says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile Press Spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2's statement: "So far, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build on."
And she adds: "By the end of the year, hardly any virtual provider will appear on the T-Mobile network.
At this moment, we should already have a concrete offer in order to be able to think in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on fulfilling the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický comments: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we see as the best from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the suppliers
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider means more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decline in profits.
Why, then, should such a competitor be made easier to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ came at the time when U:fon came onto the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also demonstrated by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is the right argument for why a virtual provider should not be allowed.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
However, given this approach by mobile operators, the absolute lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not only the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately - unlike Great Britain and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It has only the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, took its very typical attitude to this whole problem.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider via the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classical suppliers", said Kristián Chalupa from the External Relations Department of the ÚOHS in his answer to our request.
Such a formulation would not surprise suppliers’ representatives.
This is more than a concern of an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, ensuring that no one abuses their position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not part of the ÚOHS' interests.
In this case, the almost touching harmony of the three mobile operators resulting from their reactions is really shocking.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same petrol price at the petrol stations is certainly just coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs of anti-competitive action in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The regulatory authority for telecommunications is likely to lack the necessary tools to open up the mobile market to virtual providers," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And the mobile operator has - logically - the monopoly for his network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if you do not follow this argument, it should at least be a warning to the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a quite common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Act has failed to enforce the extension of the ČTÚ's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right when no one's looking
First of all, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partly public.
Usually they are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others offer their own mobile telephone services.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to selected ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar kind of resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which may lead to an end to the cooperation with the relevant company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not talk about the people responsible for mobile service providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, there may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
In fact, from the activities of these companies, they receive not negligible profits, and at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such kinds of speculation, in spite of everything, the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card on their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have it in full like the normal customers of mobile operators."
But the ČTÚ should at least seem strange.
A further question opens up for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an approach, why are they blocking themselves from a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competence to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration of the providers that they do not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers led to a significant drop in the price of the various services.
In virtually all countries where virtual providers have been created, the traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, at this very moment the regulatory bodies intervened, which did not seek to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this was followed by more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing up the whole case like a hot potato.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in competences is more than favourable in these cases.
But let's not throw the shotgun in the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon start moving again.
If a provider permits the emergence of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other interested parties (to discriminate).
And then the Czechs will finally make no more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Pick the best one
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem "Where is my homeland" at a ceremony on the occasion of the Czech Statehood Day.
The hymn was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was taken over by Kateřina Knková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo versions, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the very beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction on both and then with the choir, so that the text could be understood well, so that a harmony could be achieved," the conductor said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov můj" was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the stage theatre in the originally Czech play "Fidlovačka" by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound?
The Prague transport companies will also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1st, 2008 will enter the history of Prague's transport companies as a date when the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in their pockets instead of a paper ticket will enter a subway, tram or bus.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and can play it on their chip card at the same time, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádra
The coupons are also available on the Internet since yesterday on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use Internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
They buy the coupon via the Internet, which is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"There is also a desk with trained staff available to travellers at these points, which advises interested parties on the Internet purchase and also places the coupon on the map," said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-service machines on the opencard, which are installed in some underground vestibules.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, remind of ticket evaluation, the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," adds Opatrný.
The coupon is controlled by an automatic machine instead of the driver
The operation of the vending machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, with which especially the inhabitants from municipalities of the region of central Bohemia reach the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated traffic, the train attendants have reading devices that enable them to check the period of validity of the coupons according to time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organisation, who compiles the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's ticket counter.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be presented to the driver, but the open card must be placed in a marked position on the side of the cash register.
Thus the driver checks the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon expires can in turn go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States
The Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States in 1945.
This is evident from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the US President in 1945.
This can be seen, among other things, from a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau ask the American President not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "people to whom the fate of the Sudeten lies at the heart."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - suspect that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection over the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are acknowledging a state that is foreign to us, which is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has done nothing at all to contribute to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the US President has doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it is sufficient that he initiates a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or live under the protective rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naïve in today's knowledge of post-war history, some contemporary witnesses believe that it paints a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans at least had to suspect that they would be negotiating their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them accepted such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
During the war he was employed as a German Budweiser in the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he was taken to a prisoner of war camp in Holstein at the end of the war, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would suit them," said Chalupa.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected that he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotional campaign aimed at drivers
Expensive action on safety on the streets in Czech history.
This is also the way to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček's office promises to dissuade drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million kroner will run on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
She's supposed to get the drivers off the wheel from driving too fast and drinking too fast.
And they also remind you to wear a seat belt before you start driving.
The campaign is aimed primarily at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies to this:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are written in capital letters on a plate plate.
And in a pool of blood, the word "pay."
This means that one can pay for a moment of inattentiveness with one's own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see pictures with drastic shots of accident victims.
It is expected that the number of accidents and the number of road fatalities on Czech roads will decrease.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Carrot and whip for drivers
"For the drivers, the motto is carrot and whip.
Carrot means that if they drive red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, boards that alert drivers to a danger are even less effective.
"If you put on a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow into the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert spoke out in favour of returning virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace could be achieved in exchange for this with Palestine and Syria.
He emphasized this in an interview published on Monday by the daily Jediot Akronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to assign a similarly high percentage to the Palestinians (Israeli territory) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants safety in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templar and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert was in favour of Israel withdrawing from the Golan Heights, which he felt was an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert affirmed.
"The Syrians know all too well what they have to do without in order to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to renounce their present relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister specified.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long distance bus the running around is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a student agency bus near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk back and forth on the bus while driving.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a twenty - two - year - old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the way for the bus.
The young woman was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place in the car at this moment, although she had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply at the moment when the steward carries out coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is also equipped with standing places after the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided for on the bus, passengers must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses have no standing places, as confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jančura, opposite Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this first did not agree with the movement of travelers.
Later, this was withdrawn, and we reached a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he said.
The law knows no steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of vehicle attendants, but it does not define their rights and obligations," the spokesman of the Hanzelka Ministry clearly adds.
On the other hand, the director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law covers this problem retrospectively.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in product approval.
That's all then," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As on the plane, says the expert
The BESIP expert for road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"With a liquid driving mode, not many dangers are threatening, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Here, too, it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can bump his head."
"However, if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, this problem is not fully solved.
Jančura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not regard their profession as risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will cancel it.
Guests can get coffee and newspapers while boarding.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin establishes the absence of stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we fight against them right from the start.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had said for Týden.cz not quite a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a regular bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, had crashed.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off the floor strip without blinking and had blocked the bus's journey.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura denies that the two seats had been sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a 30-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
"However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving," said Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the work of the stewards as something that could seriously endanger the safety of passengers", says Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of the buses being the competence of the police and the health and safety authorities.
Düsseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB Executive Board to the employees of the company does not lack any big words.
By merging the units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstitut with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could arise, according to the letter, which became known on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
In general, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult time.
Because the WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government recently made clear, the time has come to find a solution for the future.
A connection between the Deka bank, which Sparkassen customers know about because of their investment funds, and WestLB has been talking about for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka Bank CEO Franz Waas informed us about the presentation of the half-yearly figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, half of which is owned by the Landesbanken and the savings banks associations, has instructed the Executive Board to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
Of course, the discussions have only just begun, as it is said at the financial centre.
Deka Bank, one of the more important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre with its 3000 employees, is not the first time that we have talked about consolidation in the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, it looked like Deka Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing became of this Tripartite League.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government opposed the participation of Helaba.
Also the other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been thought games about a connection between the Deka bank and Landesbanken.
However, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, had recently spoken out against planning games about going together with his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to be maturing to realize that a collapse of the various public sector houses is in need.
Now that the state election in Bavaria is over, the first step could be a connection between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, the partners are gradually running out of time for it.
In the south, it would only be junior partners, although it has been much better through the financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, put a stop to a merger with West LB.
If necessary, the North LB would remain.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
The other is the question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question with which business model the future viability of the Landesbanken should be ensured had not been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end there could also be a breakdown of the West LB, which is obviously not wanted there.
In the letter of the local board of directors, it is also mentioned that a "total solution" for the house is in any case being sought.
How this can be reconciled with the merging of individual units with the Deka bank will be shown.
The second Wiesn weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca it is the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded tiger and proves the 200 Oktoberfest travelers, what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap first, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking next to Puorta Nuova train station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della Birra", will start this evening at 23.45 p.m., arrival expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved for Italians, only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with imitation fur lining and glasses with wide silver temples, owns the buses.
They have been going to the Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the meadow, back at 10.30 p.m.
Spending the night would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed true to the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses are rolling into the night, on the Autostrada towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
The station is located in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian registration numbers take another break on the motorway 8 just before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven o'clock in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On it stands "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, next to it the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors to the beer tent open, it is called running!", Marco calls into the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, distribute in the room!"
The measure, Marco roars, cost 8,25 euros.
And don't forget to tip.
"The security people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they're gone!"
Third, "Return here at 1:30 tonight!" Got it?
And we're off to the meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as waymarks to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be prepared for retreat.
It is the second Wiesn weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; 50 000 people are talking about going across the Alps and falling into the beer tents; ten percent of all visitors are said to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven policemen from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistics in which the Italians take first place before the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical care.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
It is a good thing that the politician used the word "relatively" and that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis.
Because that has now occurred on the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) listed in the Dax receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan support amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only had to pay the interest it had to pay.
The money came from both private and public banks.
The background is losses at the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, the state financier had refinanced himself extremely in the short term - which is no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also fallen slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial operations fell to zero compared to the same period last year, the income from attributions to receivables and certain securities as well as from the liquidation of provisions in the credit business decreased by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher returns from refunds of downstream settlement costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the tax code and from the business supply for Group companies, the earnings decrease had still been moderate at around 16 percent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier first speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been dissociated from Aareal Bank.
Because the traditional state financing was not well-deserved, the Depfa had then become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have an "essential material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is quite indeterminate.
The fact is that the dividend was cancelled.
It had already been cut by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been an important state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks has largely dried up again, as the banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding annually for a part of the Depfa’s loan portfolio – around 50 billion euros.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded "from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international money markets".
It can be heard from other sources that the funds will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
This stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank to hope.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
In fact, it is not unthinkable that the funding should not be used in full.
But the opposite is not the case either.
After the bank was still insolvent on late Sunday evening, the at least temporary rescue cannot calm the moods.
The share price drops by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, bond prices are fairly good.
If the priority debt is hardly moved, the price of the subordinated bonds will fall more sharply.
The bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are particularly affected and understandably the maturities beyond 2009.
If hypo-real estate bonds once seemed to be a speculative investment alternative, their value should be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of the Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less prosperous commercial banks are still willing to support the system, it can be assumed that pensions will be repaid on time.
Or there is what hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports of partial nationalisation, the likelihood of security has only become a legitimate hope at the moment.
This should mainly prepare long-term believers for some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should part with their engagements.
Short-term investors can at least use a closing line to make a loss carry-forward for future settlement tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start giggling: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before I went to school, I had babbles.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of lessons at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as our home in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive at eight o'clock until a short meeting with the teacher begins at twenty to nine o'clock, the 'home room'.
But before the class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk to people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on my guest mom's old skirt, blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all snuggled, giggled and waved and constantly I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cutely, sweet'.
Then I quickly went to my place.
The girl next to me was grinning pretty broad, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was literally stunned.
Everyone talked confused and giggled and asked me holes in my stomach - but it is really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of them unpacked their Bentos.
My guest mother had also made me such a lunchbox - that's something different than the boring German break breads.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofu coat.
I don't usually know what exactly I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums maybe, brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which she prepares especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during a snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I can't wait to see if I can watch this.
'Why Japan of all people?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because I'm fascinated."
After all, I've been reading mangas for years.
And so that I can understand the comics and the culture in them better, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was perfectly clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a passion for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is organized so well, I haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees in case of danger, does that mean she also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how could you check if they feel the same if they behave similar to us?
In the Internet magazine " Edge", contributions from famous scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it goes dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with the human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in the short-term memory and in the execution / control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in man than in the other primates and seems to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, however it may be, may differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor analyzed on the basis of our own experience, because of the special hardware, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more accessible scientifically.
One could investigate the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies of the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one shifts rather to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the emergence of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) proves memory.
From this point of view, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex that distinguish primates and, in particular, humans.
Combined with linguistic nature, subtle gradations of feeling result, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar, in order to attribute them to others as well as ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, on the other hand, says that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-genre sensations.
In theory, I cannot disagree, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans probably also feels this way in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same if they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in case of danger if she too feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove an equal experience.
Although the neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain strains, cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove that for humans, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is waved at the neural level, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
I don't know if they exist when I don't study language and consciousness in rats, and I don't know if they exist.
You might think it's short-sighted, but I'd rather get ahead than walk against a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts lag behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian Federation President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several first league players had been sentenced to forced retirement for manipulation alone in the past season, after which even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Outrageous Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about private things in the interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her lost Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
It foams - and strikes back.
Late Rosenkrieg with ex-marriage Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan said for the first time about the reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She found out the extent of the fraud only after the divorce.
The reason for the soul triptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Unbelievable," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News," "Meg repeatedly chews and seals the history of our relationship."
It is also "deplorable" that the common 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so close his introductory remarks with the sidelash: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Prices for air tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than last year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany even became up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The Company has analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, noted a significant decline in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, the overnight stays in many places have already become cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities still rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees this as the cause of the weak dollar rate, which has led to a "decreasing travel desire of American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend in air fares in the first quarter also showed an upward trend:
Because of the kerosene price increase, travellers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights even became up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class air tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but price changes in the business and first-class were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter, they decreased by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
On the one hand, the drop in prices is due to a slowdown in economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the open skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, has increased competitive pressure.
The tense situation was marked by the removal of unprofitable routes from airlines, as well as the large number of airlines which had declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, these were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburg SV will be the leader of the table.
Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning eleven in Borussia.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play only late and failed with a lift to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, it was convincingly over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin passage of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most sat back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, he enjoys a higher reputation than many past actors.
And so his request also found hearing in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
Its command will have been similar: give me gate two!
The implementation was not possible.
"It wasn't all nice to look at today," admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it more "relaxed".
The 1-0 (1:0) is due to the headball hit of Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarized.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon the spectators already celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class prime.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify this," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the inter-table testimony stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-committed approaches - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric as well as the Jansen recruited by FC Bayern - find themselves slowly, but she is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol demanded.
After the defeat of the vote
On Wall Street, the fear is over.
First news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily caused Dow Jones to break in by 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points in one day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught up again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer was listed at 10,579 counters with a good five percent in the minus.

The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could win.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares fell by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett took part in the company.
The rescue plan is intended to provide funds for the purchase of so-called rotting mortgage securities.
However, the sum is not to be paid out at one stroke, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock option notes from financial companies that could be redeemed if price developments were appropriate to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA in the downward sog

Dark matter influences flight from space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused perplexity: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of soon freezing fuel lines, she is now threatened with cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the swing-by-anomal.
The swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes, in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been wondering about for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as would be expected under the time-honoured law of gravity.
On the contrary, irregularities occur at the rate of speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not transmit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists’ calculations, dark matter accounts for just over a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt are said to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The hijackers from Sudan had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six hostage-takers were said to have been killed in a shootout before the release.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations are already under way.
Again and again Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media in agreement.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been liberated.
We're just checking her state of health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian woman, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are safe and sound, reports Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security officer, the hijackers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the hijackers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the official.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather caused a woman to kill herself, was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after confessing eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle was killed at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1st, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked for the National Trust on a voluntary basis for a large part of her time, was persecuted by abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends said that Mrs. Randle, who had been an avid surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "spent her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended up like this: "I used to tie her up and blindfold her."
"I didn't force her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been frightening for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of what impact, according to Stephanie's father and mother, her actions over the years had on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials in charge of lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was seconded from the Department of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally by the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is charged under paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor's Office recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police with the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he transferred contained classified assessments of Al-Qaeda and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies face B&B costs
British housing companies could cost more than £80 million after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided £14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans have been repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies have to raise 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate upturn are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are bilateral organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk will cost five pence per litre
The people of Jersey are faced with paying more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations have been carried out by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Prior to the price increase in February, the wholesale market price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her defense attorneys said that the court refused bail on the charge of extorting 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail early this month.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the interim military-backed government first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents say that, although her detention suspension was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of her release whether she will be able to continue to be free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she doesn't have to get bail because she's already on suspension abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the upper court."
Her lawyers claim that she needs bail to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami Alliance leader on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-assisted transitional government took power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan has not vaccinated nearly 200,000 children because of the violence associated with the Taliban.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or impede the thousands of immunization workers.
BskyB loses action in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its claim against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing channel ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorts competition and allows it to influence ITV unfairly.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB’s purchase of the share of ITV in ITV had expressed doubts about the independence of ITV, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Department of Ofcom have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, especially because BskyB had announced its intention to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. Attorney's Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the dismissal of the nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice criticising the actions of the administration staff.
The report criticised the White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The Special Investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the judiciary.
Serious allegations, including criminal actions, have not been fully investigated or resolved, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appeal of a special investigator with the authority to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine US prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors were dismissed due to weak work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of Democratic electoral fraud.
U.S. prosecutors are charged with investigating and persecuting court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
Alberto Gonzales, then head of the Department of Justice, has been bombarded because of the dismissals and has ultimately resigned.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General's report critically addressed the role of Gonzales by bearing the "main responsibility" for dismissals, giving up his leadership role and showing himself "extraordinarily disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former Chief Adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honoured for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell" during the music award ceremony "Q Award".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize in London next week during the award ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track for Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's awards after being shortlisted in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there are some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to acute larynx inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of major roads, avenues, side roads, and other bypasses, some of which are famous and some are just convenient.
Nevertheless, it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are no road signs either.
It's practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-flap Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the block.
But the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the community council's land use committee this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the construction company to purchase the road.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district officials in the Municipal Council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street would be re-flated and seats designed, among other things, for a café to which the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the road, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this dilapidated alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Building Protection Department, said it was indeed the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop rather than manage the real estate.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of his historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly most known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Dying City"), has published part of the conversation in the city's history about Extra Place, published in the 1952 magazine "The New Yorker".
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end, which remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rain gutters".
With a few exceptions, the street looked just like that recently on an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bunch of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be slightly polished.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in English-speaking environments
In this issue of the Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Researcher in California Studies and Senior Director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of Afro-American and Hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than that of white students" - which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s educational plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition period in education for those who are learning English.
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 an astonishing 100 percent of fourth grade students passed the state examination in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were rated as good in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The school Sixth Street places its emphasis on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach by which education takes place in an English-speaking environment. This is exactly what Obama is supposed to consider, according to headmaster Linda Mikels.
This approach places great emphasis on the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialized teaching.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later you would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students?
The school's achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within his own party (national image associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "English only".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the gap in performance, he should carefully consider educational models that work instead of scorning and trivializing them.
Oil prices are falling as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The price of oil fell strongly on Monday due to fears that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures on the New York Stock Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they dropped to almost $90 per barrel this month, and then rose again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors showed concern again, although congressional representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan this weekend, which should be the biggest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the final chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, the Citigroup is to buy up the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not been possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a statement to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank’s analysts have revised their oil consumption expectations downwards due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and reduced their oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he'd been in the Jets jersey more often than anyone in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter where the Jets turned a fruitless game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
After a sloppy match between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon when her developing collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one as an outside defender and the other as 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't make much effort," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote voted no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense quarterback took Kurt Warner apart.
External defender Darrelle Revis caught an accident and turned him into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and picked him up.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced on Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets regained the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yards shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, coach of the Jets, replied, "The Second Quarter or the Third Quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without achieving a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown again why some people think he is the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to make the 42.2 km run in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every distance from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, for fear, which may have been exaggerated in retrospect, that air pollution could worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long-distance, the record time for marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won the result 2:06:05 in 1998 in Berlin.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie informed the press that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Obviously he came back after a break, refreshed and not rusted.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started the training again a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for over orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders, as if this were a race track, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had slackened.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last move to separate from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a considerable year by showing the seventh fastest result ever with 2:19:19.
Paul Radcliff from Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as a back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She cleverly planned her run by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners teared out, but passed after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the outgrowths of amusement parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic hustle and bustle, is a quiet city where the pride and complications of Afro-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the Federal Writer Project at the time of the depression – is in many respects a very special place.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what is missing from him."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential scandal, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, a native of the city and a parishioner of the city's oldest church.
It must be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And so the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Naughty as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Beyond the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of all kinds and what-also-always fits hours."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came into town, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in trousers, in a city that even today is imagining its venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he rocked in his chair, on a back-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was probably baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a famous writer, a contemporary of Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no big memorial, no public readings in a big style.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the community.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"During this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the off-site people," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to enforce integration by calling its decision in Brown's case against the school council "insulting instead of respecting my race."
Residents nowadays say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - hugging his teacher in the morning and hugging his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri , daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained until teachers and students stopped coming from the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural divide," said Ms Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped to create room for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who ignored prejudices, just as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements like: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker set out for Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found on the bookshelfs, and made it again part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public light.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road building plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway revived the city, accelerated the whole at peak speed, awakened real civic pride," said Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
More and more people came, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays Eatonville is still a peculiarity in Florida: only 6 miles from downtown Orlando can it sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its meaning are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews a permit is necessary in advance and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in the field work - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and hardworking, silly and mixed up like any other race and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or with the police, who according to him could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to correctly describe Eatonville.
"Most people who only pass through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York they speak fluently financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they're in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass façades, bankers and hedge fund administrators who have the monopoly in New York, they have the worst horror day every day since the 1929 stock market crash.
The suppliers still push with loud rattles the metal tea carts along sidewalks and carry trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still slid around between apartments like human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bagel on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, due to all the doomsday talk, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were already in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for the way to the department store Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", stood for the same reason as I queued.
In contrast to me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called Thrifts (a little similar to a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying that they treat their customers as family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silently and quietly bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, went into bankruptcy management and when last Friday New Yorkers drove home for the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion in savings, was looking for a saving buyer.
Fearing another collapse, the office and shop clerks standing in front of me took their bares to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have acquired a flowing financial Latin in recent weeks.
A woman who spoke on the phone in my Chinese stock market referred with so much familiarity to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and its emaciated-looking CEO Dick Fuld as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, got away from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I changed, I'm not going to risk anymore."
Muslemic graves desecrated during right slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008 to represent the organisation "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed out with a red line.
The police accused right-wing extremists of grave desecration in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend that extremely right-wing parties made significant profits in the country's parliamentary election.
On the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an action organized according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this to be an attempt to obscure the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way connected with the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" about the news of the grave desecration that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan came to an end.
At the same time, there is a round of research into conscience in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas and even expressed his aversion to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which indicate that the extreme right is the politically strongest bloc in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam rock star who has been convicted of sexual abuse by children, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted a foreign travel ban last Thursday after she presented evidence of Glitter's criminal record of sexual abuse of children to the judges.
Glitter, the real name of Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning.
EIn Spokesman of the Court reported: "On Thursday, September 25, Kent Police requested permission from the Ashford District Court to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25th.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
According to the register for sex offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a five-year prison term.
The Kent police said they wouldn't discuss individual cases or glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's police unit said, "Kent's police will do everything they can to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the chief concern of the Kent police to protect Kent's residents and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to the UK.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to request that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who renounce concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find a gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expressiveness of the hands that are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer portrays a varied theatricality of several productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the month of flamenco photography, 'reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'flamenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera.'
In 1997, Bauer, inspired by the 'Cante de las Minas' festival, set off on a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, whereby the image is given the modernity and the idea, as the Bauer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the near future.
Famous figures in Flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selections of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of sports' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the 'Flamenco-people' project are different, the photographer `it ́s very nice to photograph the people, to get to know them and to put me in their state of life, be it for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or meet people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of flamenco portraits of today entitled 'Flamenco-people' is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, located in the street called la calle de la Mata, parallel to the street of la Alameda de Hercules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he's writing is 'a foolhardy'.
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project on which he is currently working, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project with which he is concerned is 'a madman' and 'everything indicates that he does not have to write the novel'.
'If I were prudent, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at some point,' so he concluded his participation at the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival festival and to whom most of the participants gave their voice, is compared with the old edition of 'Our Mutual Friend' and can be seen in the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who had a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, which was based on 'extraordinary adventure', on 'joy at reading' and 'experiencing more than before'; how he writes and 'discipline' to supplement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentations, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what 'memory images' it is that form the basis for his stories.
The Hispanic American novelist admitted that there is 'no way' to measure what one can and how one can know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,' Vargas Llosa stressed, who claims that it 'brings forth effects' and 'brings people apart even more', so I asked the writers 'not to leave themselves to lightness' and 'take responsibility' for his calling.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play along: bullfighting parties were partly cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters realized that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfighting festival with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be concluded was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was exposed to the volatile weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after whom he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, a large part of the audience reacted in his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes to ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the city of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers called on the drivers of the car to stop, and they fled.
It looked like they wouldn't have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police chased her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The person arrested was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police of the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped at the edge strip after a few kilometers. At that moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee to a forest area via a country road.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally caught up with one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and weighing of the bundles to other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was 'double', so that it did not match the license plate indicated in the car papers, which is why an additional arrest was carried out for forgery of official documents.
The police of Ertzaintza City are continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to escape, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. who was arrested was taken to a police station for questioning. He will be brought to the prison judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effects of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effects of an unknown drug.
One witness observed how she tried to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, California traffic police spokesman reported to the magazine 'People'.
The witness told in detail that Locklear 'pressed the accelerator after 16:30 and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.'
A little later, the witness saw that the actress probably didn't realize at the beginning that Locklear stopped on a nearby street and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'feared to live around Locklears'.
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street blocking traffic.
'She seemed disoriented,' so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed herself cooperative, overindulgence in alcohol was ruled out from the first moment. 'Following the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' says the spokesman.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined and taken to a local detention centre around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, after treatment, Locklaer was released from the Arizona hospital, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Union of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and Member of the United Left, has today assured that the Regional Association of Education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the Town Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one that must take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out the way the party must proceed towards the one who is currently sitting as city councillor in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva might have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has 'a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de mayo': Book of Heroes by Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci presents in `Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment for filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to 'present a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci today explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of actors.
`Sangre de mayo', with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and later shown on Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós' literature, assures us that thanks to this filming his 'childhood dream' came true. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who, three years ago, commissioned him from the autonomous community of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the second centenary in Madrid on 2 November. Above all, because the story is based on 'Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the commission.
The total contribution of 15 million filmed by the autonomous community of Madrid offers Garci, as he added, the 'one-time possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'confused Spain, which chose the false leader for the fight, because the people had been delayed by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that it could not be expected to be financed as with 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with 'Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', has contributed through his usual way of working: he stood on stage with the actors with whom you have to rehearse first before you start shooting and for those who had not done casting he appeared 'smoothing' and providing respect, 'a part of the film director's profession consists of helping in theater and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many actors he encounters in 'Sangre de mayo' must repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he has won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year is a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' nor, finally, the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
'In the beginning you think you are working for the offspring, later you realize that it is only for prosperity, and now you are satisfied when you have still produced a film,' explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville adores a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and stood up for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell about her life, but to preserve her Esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The dance of the butterfly' seemed to me like Guajira, for example, or 'the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area,' she claims.
The production anticipates two extraordinary collaborations: Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work together with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The production also anticipates musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were divas to whom he repeatedly falls in love.'
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
'I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain epoch and whose works no one knows anymore and therefore appreciates her even less,' claims Bayón.
The performance takes place today at 20:30 at the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón married Jiménez in 1916 Zenobia, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of the two.
Thus `the Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress, which takes place in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The U.S. Can't Imagine Without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'sensation reporter', and from the then prevailing performance of the American cinema, which was abandoned, from the whole of America to Newman with his inspiring performance and followed her.
Look what it cost to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, that was a big blow for everyone.
'What a person sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford weeping, 'my life and my country were the greatest drolls of his life.'
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
As the 'father' of the cinema and the country, he died in a sad moment in which there is fear of terrorists and of the collapse of the market, in which the depressed self-esteem of the Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If only a few people who can be admired remain in this hard time without virtue, you do not necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses both profits: from the Foundation, which has dedicated itself to the fight against drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to the own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country, where it took him a lot of effort to fight a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of astonishment strikes high above Hollywood to take regardless of nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the wicked boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'We have left the greatest of us all,' confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live like Paul Newman lived: to maintain high demands on righteousness, to lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced one time and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful to, although there were certainly many ways not to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?' he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was as proud of none as he was of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropist,' they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are inadequate.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, maybe it could be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true!
She was described as a perfect road, and in my judgment, she was the worst road with everything on it.
Of course, that is a lot of nonsense, if you would consider the evaluation and I could examine it, such a thing would clearly not have come through.
But let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket-taking that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams on the road).
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense is to go there only because of it) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like this are a little bit compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
In addition, it looked like in these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, so there was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the cottage.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for classification because of this chip I have received, I can already imagine that the outcome has been incorrectly stamped.
Of course, if I were asked about a perfect road, I would never think of that road.
So I think we will long dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the company's campus).The system observes what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also classify those present after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that is talking to her, and that he is not a company employee either.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will be listening soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about the change of strategy of Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added one or the other feature and 'extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Skillfully, many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to function simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the environment of the 'windows'.
What is half of the computer's existing applications for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsoft is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, without a doubt. I have a small example of it.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the soft drink machine is attached a sign: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use its own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google for web searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we start to list the countless stars performances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had raised heavy weights in a traveling circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and tailored.
The English speakers call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, surpasses all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. Legend tells that the name creation is connected with sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' dominates all because of its outstanding cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that have these T-shirts as detail on the neckline.
And be careful, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton trousers, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's a shame to use them as undergarments.
You're very charming.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't care about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite, but full of joie de vivre.
At the moment, Gruz siblings take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved there her residence and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner in Valentino's honour.
A very intensive working time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dress, combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many similarities.
Ever since I was little, I was thrilled with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother's to rummage around in my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a theme park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to look after the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected to each other, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
I don't know.
I feel better than ever, as a thirty-year-old, I feel good.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've wanted to do since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time I have known that I am becoming a mother because my body demands it and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried about that.
I will give my child great happiness and raise it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you took part in and were shot last year.
That's exactly how it is, and I want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which, of course, cannot be immediate.
I very much hope that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A few days ago, you showed up on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
All right, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, simply called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two items of clothing from our Mango collection were auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I, as the one she knows, would tell you they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good cause in which she is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous cause, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers, who can be relapsed because of the alcohol level, will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver who had three official penalties for the alcohol level installs in his car this system, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholized, then the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General. According to her, it is a pilot project, which will last for a year.
The purpose is the rehabilitation of the driver, which is why he gets a course for the re-education of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Attorney General's Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of motorists, who were reported more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol, returned to driving.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system associated with the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostarting when the driver has made alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration is determined which is higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1 000, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the US in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of the standard violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, 115 lives are expected to be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be implemented by ordinary means, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is called for, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still not available in Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow of all days, the House of Deputies will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time scheduled by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF Airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with which Prince and Princess of Asturias travelled, landed.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced them to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple who got out of the plane.
Directly on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time of day. They're from here or something.
No, she's the Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport and at the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the navy, who surrender the salve of honour.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', perhaps she was told that it is expected to be a thunderstorm in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, there is a reporter from Mexican television who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no much outstanding fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Rewards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the Mango store window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris yesterday and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is located in London.
So many events have happened that are connected to the fact that one wants to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart broken by the pain, because his brother recently died, pulls himself together. He pulled the suit from the fashion house and wore some jewelry from ELAH, which were breathtaking. He held on to his son Luis' arm, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house Mango, greeted the guests and was such a cavalryman, so he ended up with the Baron von Rotschild without jackets, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hurried to the store and had a pair of trousers and a shirt on, which she modelled herself, and at dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got into excitement, remembered the old days, grabbed a pole and made a sort of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre didn't join the walk through the palace's premises, but before that she had shown us her son's photos on her cell phone.
The next morning we could look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own bed lacquers and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There is not 1000, but one more way to forget chaotic everyday life.
And although there are few, they are all collected in a book that says how to relax, and the book comes to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 o'clock in the morning, but even worse the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the voltage and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of how to turn off the world of work.
But the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of options adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 opportunities to relax' and thus the calm that the book conveys comes to the bookshops of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such faith.
In addition, methods are offered as to how to stay in contact with nature or to propose 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance of the body and stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleep talk.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you were told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is no single reason to cause this phenomenon.
Often relationships with other phenomena in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panicking at night, enuresis noctura (bed wetting at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it may be due to very high fiber, stress situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks, whispers, or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and advised by a specialist to check whether there is a problem, which causes fear and thus arises.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are horrible and a little too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner calm.
This helps the child sleep calmly.
When speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it's harmless to the child, and the next day it won't remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of your sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it turns out frightened after a pair of appearances, it is recommended to consult or find out what the child is afraid of.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child is asleep, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams of and why it says so, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, don't tell the kid that you hear this at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That's a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhäuser ... finally
After a long thirst stretch, Illhäusern on the field is finally back on track for success.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks won numerous goals and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long shot just passed the angle, Illhäusern was to dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded alternately first Fonderflick with a long shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip, to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only allowed the lively Riahi to pass at the head of the storm.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with two goal chances initially won by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, which stood just right to accept a ball that had been repelled in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the Ilhäusian goal scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, whereby his teammates had to play in numerically inferior numbers.
Denmark, however, did not know how to take advantage of this and did not face any big problems to an Illhaeusian Elf, which just pulled back a little to 'compress' their defenses, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to arrive in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hoped that he would come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee set up by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of more than EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to David Martinon, spokesman for the Elysée Palace, 'the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure the conditions of employment and the payment of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen.
Tuesday morning they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvado, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometres.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break down.
The Quiberon Peninsula was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets from the early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the major total refinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting to take place on Wednesday at the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those in charge of the National Fisheries Committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give in to any point' and 'will not go to Paris', announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, for example.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 as a result of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes said goodbye to the film legend and the engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the impending recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, maintains its supply forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, affirming its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has supplied 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider surrendering more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, is considering giving up more than 15% of its assets to pay back the 85 billion dollars that were advanced to it.
AIG is willing to drive the sale of a large part of its business beyond its international life insurance and pension provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the AIG Board of Directors met Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained with the AIG.
The assets that AIG might be able to separate from include its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, FT continues.
AIG has to make the sales as quickly as possible to repay the loans over 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve, also at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will be equally lost.
Analysis Historical Paris of the session Historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic case of prices on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As far as points are concerned, the strongest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final firing figures, the Nasdag index, mainly for technology, fell by 196,61 points to 1,983.73, and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection by the Chamber of Deputies of the plan to rescue the banks, which was to restore some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes in favour and 205 against, the MPs refused the financial secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'A bad picture is being circulated here, which presents Congress as unable to accept a plan,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan,' she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will come 'too late'.
'If the project is indeed doomed to failure (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, note d. Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would limit the credit conditions even more,' warned Brian Bethune, Head of Economic at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized that she emphasized the feeling of extreme urgency that 'every day that passes brings 'the ruin of a financial company' in the United States.'
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy up the banking operations of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, an indication that markets are facing 'not just an American but a global crisis', the analyst of FTN Financial added.
The market for basic consumer goods has grown strongly.
The revenues of the Treasury within ten years have decreased Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and the revenues within 30 years yesterday evening from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner after points in the first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another one to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in the election of both Republicans and Democrats in this television duel, which was to be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite remarkable, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to Obama with five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
For the still undecided voters, i.e. those who matter now, Obama emerged as the winner of the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS survey 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his competitor Joseph Biden in first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts,' but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not stop putting his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, while clearly underlining his opponent's 'naïvety' on these issues, which were at the heart of this first television duel.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president,' he also assured.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican electoral commercials since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and precisely, without being upset.
He put his ability to make good decisions and renew the image that the world has of the United States.
'McCain has still not understood, but Obama has already,' this weekend set a democratic electoral spot against it, in which Republicans were accused of not having grasped the full extent of the crisis that weighs on the 'American off the street'.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,' Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in pouring rain at an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle class' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'Next week could be a crucial turning point,' estimated the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's 'good economic instincts' with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is 'the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After stressing once again that he might even manage to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that the creation of a country's potential energy independence and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, were his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully evaded the questions raised by the plan to save the financial market of over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular among the people.
'Have you noticed that there was an election in Minsk?'
Young people and opposition activists demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the polling stations in Minsk's marketplace to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous youths had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they didn't even vote: 'What good is that, if they do what they want with my voice anyway,' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is prepared to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-issue of visas for 40 leading Belarusian figures and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census,' regretted Juri Potemkin, press spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, says Alexander Milinkievich, former candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
If members of the opposition move into parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent'.
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
She stressed that the voter turnout figures seemed too high and that the extension of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that an election took place?, asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to be in line with the government's ideas.'
The silence of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - From blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
Above all, it has regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
It is known that during the 1980s national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross blood donation service were contaminated with the HIV virus and hepatitis C virus.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, in February 1994 the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to draw up guidelines to prevent another disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces set up a committee to develop a new system for the administration of canned blood in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood canning system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through the work in this field during the following years, we have regained public confidence', she says, before proudly stressing that in early 2008 nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since her founding in 1998.
'And we didn't have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we relied on one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which exclusion measures are applied if you do not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself through a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has quite a purpose.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which enable the virus to be detected directly in the donor's blood, and not the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST enabled the incubation time to be reduced between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not see it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are in danger of getting HIV - infected blood.
"In other words, you have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 cans of blood each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted via a blood preserve occurs.
I believe that you can feel comfortable these days when you get or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore your health,' says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We need to monitor continuously,' continues Dr. Décary, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must provide adequate supplies in addition to a secure supply.
`The need is increasing because the population is aging.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which includes on average only 3% of Quebec's residents suitable for blood donation.'
Every healthy person, who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria, can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who make their blood available are not accepted because, for example, they suffer from AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for one year.
`With these 3%, we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Poor supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but especially to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,' regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood preserves, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec's only public umbilical cord blood bank.
The umbilical cord, formerly considered a biomedical waste, contains blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to remove more than a thousand annually.
'We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year,' explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood loss as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced that they have no access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in semi-finals
Montreal's Impact yesterday qualified for the semi-final round of the USL's first league finals thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second quarter finals series at the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio was counted.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals for the Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that at the first game of the pre-return series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle had brought a 2 to 1 defeat.
Impact will compete with the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night, Thunder was able to make up for a 3 to 1 defeat in the Minnesota rematch through a 4 to 3 victory, but the Whitecaps nevertheless entered the semi-finals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The Canadian team's number one trio is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn drove the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the whole shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.'
`He was too attached to it in the first half, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.'
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of holding elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tried to be elected in today's partial election.
'Moving the course of our last big border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis, following entirely the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds as during the parliamentary term.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to rule out the possibility of holding the elections this autumn, even if he said that his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area' which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches in recent times, the opening of the North - the northern area at 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not give a date, investment sums or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At the very least, some prospects for what could be done more: water energy, forest, but especially mining, benefiting from the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charests, the north possesses 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This 'area twice as large as France' 'is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', he emphasized, as to show clearly that he is trying to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly by its connection with the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It's ours, it's our future,' he added, after having taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the Prime Minister told the press.
'This is a traditional attitude that all governments followed.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, when the opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government,' he said.
Moreover, 'with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North', he said, and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be passable all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the young.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist deputy of Ungava) have already begun discussions in some thirty communities.
A committee of ministers led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) occupies an important place, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to 'create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan Nord will be 'spouse, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it were a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
"Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have changed our mind to transform the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This was, by the way, one of the repeatedly raised themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's takeover of the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power station in Adélard-Godbout dam.
'From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, through Lesage, who has reached the silent revolution and nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,' explained Jean Charest.
He referred to another conservative project to the press, namely the 'Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest stressed that it was planned to be put into operation in 2012.
'This remains between us, but I intend to be there,' he confided to his party members, which was the cause of those accidental storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him under the law.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was full, mainly because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially 'objectives relating to the Constitution', which were readily adopted: The PLQ particularly calls for recognition of the 'specificity of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to veto the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition has taken up the guidelines of Plan Nord with scepticism.
The leader of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, has brought about the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done so, 'we would have gone much further today', Mrs Marois judged at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has called for the government to support the adoption of a Northern Plan.
'But what we want is that this isn't just a big show,' declared party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from his holiday today.
Letters - A dishonored land
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justice' minister (which irony) in the Harper cabinet, was the one who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'sham' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an unending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration for covering it with shame, says just as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one from all the countries concerned that has not brought home their fellow countryman trapped in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when things happened to him.
The only government that breaks its word despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention and has a child soldier vegetated under inhuman conditions.
The only one who settles down to a parody of justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remind ourselves that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers Association, in particular, are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that is also closing its eyes to torture: it is of little interest to them that a young adult, after so many years of torment, will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing here a insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries like a flag in front of him, and that sounds so meaningless from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morale left: one can arbitrarily abuse, torture and arrest a Canadian citizen, according to the wishes of a government leader, who is still supported only by the minority (may he be a member of the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this release, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17th issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-Director General of the Barrick Gold Mine in Canada.
This confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold mining company sought a libel lawsuit over six million against three authors and a small penniless publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of libel actions, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to take one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the trial proceeds, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defenses and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is, moreover, often to ruin the defenders in order to force a friendly settlement that silences the other side and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to public opinion.
In contrast to what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually held in Canada by exchanging ideas and not by beating clubs.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate through which newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and yet disregard the opinions of this very public?
Apparently, in the Vice-President's world, this word only includes generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as a gag suit (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada in which they ask them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on freedom for academic research and truth-finding that is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to deal with debates and disagreements and how to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate complaint clearly shows that, unlike what she claims, she does not want a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified lawsuit.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans get along
The Bush administration and Congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of over 700 billion US dollars, which is intended to stop the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months, still needs to be adopted by the two congress chambers.
The main contents are: better control of the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new injunctions to contain the number of houses pledged due to arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies.
American Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative Senator Judd Gregg, present at the negotiations, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news after a two-day negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market,' said the Bush administration representative, Henry Paulson.
'Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,' declared the Democrat.
'This is the basic point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily life of the Americans will be enormous,' explained Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, for fear of the effect that a renewed failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part in the negotiations only late, were more likely to be supporters of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on adding certain resolutions to the agreement, especially those designed to allow the owners to keep their homes, and those concerning the salaries of the executives of the state-saved companies.
"When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, that is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary,' he explained on American television channels.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guiding principles I have read [show] that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to progress.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,' he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at using taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble, which led to the collapse of risk-rich mortgage loans (subprime) before it expanded to further forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally to a freeze of financial strength and ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed the first attempt to reach agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'poisonous' assets of the societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not be bought, it is believed to escape the impasse.
In order to round off the perspective for everyone in Congress, an injunction has also been added that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes in order to recover its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington will receive shares in the supported companies, which will pay him dividends in the event of profits, and which it will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the option of halting the attachment proceedings concerning the dwellings linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and also setting deadlines for repayment and severance payments to the management staff of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and the Senate to vote on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, there were other votes against this plan yesterday, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
'Of course Washington does not understand us,' declared Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, to his constituents.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is asking taxpayers to pay.'
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the caucus of skeptics', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: we ask the Congress not to be pressured, and to carefully consider what course to take,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again shown to be a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which is in great difficulty since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times are announcing themselves. '
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalising another bank that was put into trouble by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank the British government has had to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump card for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor with the charming smile free himself from the narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity and obvious talent have also kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the truly terrible monsters.
But what a big runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 on the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but just as an apostle of freedom and the blasting of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream should emerge.
Without excessive ego, ultimate quality feature.
Because he reflected a whole country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was injured in combat in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who became second in the 1979 24-hour race of Man's, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a flagship relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed star, oversensitive to the glamour of the show business, the mystery of which will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death moved cinema lovers to Taumel this weekend, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is passing by with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind again, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) into The Cat on the hot tin roof filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) is evoked that of his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Hand Full of Dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was meant for James Dean, was re-recorded after his death and made the Newman well-known in 1956.
This likeable goose in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), who was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As an embittered and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through time, that was it.
Still him.
His résumé unites epochs.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends who have withdrawn from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his magnificence and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour, as a living challenge to 'underplaying' when he judged his overly expressive achievements.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time only.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotic, alcoholic, nasty or desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slip and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown aspects of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a sensitive portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott due to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
At the flood of honors that erupted yesterday over Newman, his close friend and former arms mate Robert Redford (who played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared extremely apprehensive: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generousness and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's drifting away, is now going on.
We have often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other food, and this considered quite tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: 'Always and to the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.'
And it was an honor for us to be allowed to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Hammer &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations begin in the criminal trial against Jáno's contract and his accomplices.
In particular, the accused are accused of participating in organised crime, of grossly negligent harm and business fraud, and of other criminal acts, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the funds extracted from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often covered by counterfeit invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have partly been channelled into the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and partly into the private funds of individual companies.
According to the investigation authorities, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender money was received and the clubs were not supposed to have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills have been forged.
The invoice blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the circular seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue invoices was taken on that round trip north of Lake Balaton, to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploratory tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He asked for bills on consumptions so that he could later issue invoices based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the self-government of Budapest.
The majority of these invoices are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploratory tour" was a beer restaurant.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zugabe und Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the ninety-strong group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company indicates that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another bill issued in the summer of 2002 by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also had serious formal and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed according to the bill.
There were apparently no limits to the imagination of the counterfeiters when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering company, in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even appear according to the prosecution authority.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas informed hvg.hu, he immediately realized that the documents were forged when documents were submitted to him by the Public Prosecutor’s Office during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were wrongly placed on the stamp."
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the company is said to have accommodated one hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms, which are impossible to accommodate so many people, was also wrong.
Also on the invoice food was mentioned, the restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The diligent counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted offers only travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary travel on the cash payment account, which also contradicted the accounting practice of the company.
As was known in the course of the investigation, they also cited VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services related to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total value added tax was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the company only offsets 15 percent VAT instead of 25. Furthermore, the employees only issue machine invoices, but the falsified documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "invoicers" was that in one case they had indicated "goods transport" as a service provided, although this was not offered by the company specializing in investment advice, the prosecutor's office informed.
Further formal errors - wrong invoice format, wrong stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as forgeries.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors said that they never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" occurred to the forgers at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was at the time (2001) in fact in dissolution, when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that he had not issued the invoices himself.
Consciously Fake
The other group of accountants are persons who were quite aware that they would have to lay fictitious invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued invoices for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, amounting to around HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, persuaded the manager of Collab Kft. to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is currently also in liquidation, is also said to have worked together with a supplement and co. In 2003 the GmbH should have supplied the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület associations with counterfeit invoices for the total value of HUF 5 million, which related to services not provided.
However, there were no payment transactions, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, but the data subjects forgot to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based but untraceable fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components for the total value of HUF about 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has confessed during the investigation to have issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian bricklayers on Iván Kubatov's explicit wish.
However, the truth is that none of these companies were active, which according to the defendant was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's start-up documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is expected to have issued 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov may have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT each.
Kubatov is said to have even misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for issuing fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were enclosed with the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA") the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party.
Both received 500,000 forints each, but have used these amounts for purposes other than their own.
To cover this up, they submitted five fictitious invoices to the TMA of the Works Team Kft.
By the way, these invoices were taken into account when searching the Árpád Kemecsei office in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some defendants are now expecting a confession about the procedure for falsifying invoices, as they have already been filed before the prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if the main accused Jáno’s bid decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him on reparation for the bulk of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the supplement in return is willing to assume responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that Hammer is now playing the "insulted" after his requests for relief from imprisonment and house arrest had been met with deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater harm with economic crimes and have not paid for them, are at large, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is denied.
The psychology of overbidding - or why we are willing to pay more
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bid.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play Lotto while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the overbidding of the opponent plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this region of the brain is responsible for the "self-remuneration" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, economists in the research group have additionally carried out investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group were also promised $15 reward in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that the emphasis was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "against losing" group were willing to make higher bets than those in the control or "win" group.
"These results cannot be derived from previous economic theory.
These have so far only justified the behaviour observed at auctions with the pleasure of winning or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor be consulted?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death in Hungary.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the generic term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and the diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, vaginal secretion or saliva).
In any case, travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are approximately two-three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, around 1 million people die every year from hepatitis B-induced diseases, which are far more severe, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten people infected is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen destroys the liver cells insidiously - in many cases the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognised in good time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, held for the first time in 2004 by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to increase awareness of this chronic liver infection caused by viruses, their development and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research shows, religious faith acts like a kind of "painful remedy" that is said to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was investigated to what extent belief in God influences the feeling of pain of man, reports the British newspaper "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting by the Mother of God.
The results showed that the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be proven that Catholics could activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a painting of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would create a kind of religious trance, while they chose da Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as comforting.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages while viewing either the religious or the other painting.
Catholics reported that at the sight of the Mother of God they felt "safe" as if they were "concerned" and they felt "peace and peace".
While viewing the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in mind.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that one could also produce similar effects with other, strong-looking images with the atheists, one only had to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find an image that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist says.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practising the faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases," Wright says.
After these excellent results, only the question remains, what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that she can be found in people's pockets just as she can be found above their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, what specialists they go to, and what moves her.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's CEOs.
Towards skeptics who are plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he says: These would just overlook the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times recently, Schmidt said that Google's main goal was to collect even more personal data about the users and thus to get closer to the original goal of the company, according to which it wanted to "order all the information of this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still at the beginning of collecting information.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so, as they do not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows visitors to save their own search history and to use it later so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and the so-called "recommendations" are also based on the same logic with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services based on previous preferences.
However, the users wonder what happens in the event of data misuse - "When you look at what I do" - some people are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the company's representation of potential power that is frightening, and less the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the revolt against power that many Internet users are opposed to.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an occasion, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent action against paedophilia in Brazil, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the paedophilia.
However, users concerned about personal rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief in May when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully appealed against the FBI in court: therefore, Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on secret request with any point of the Constitution in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but has been retroactively withheld from it the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list, for two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google services, scourge the company with the outrage due to conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is market leader thanks to Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes for its users and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems to be far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship that has come to the fore especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, i.e. the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show itself publicly.
An average youth can simultaneously manage his profile on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries that are geosted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at the party photos last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has been enjoying himself with, or the employee is dismissed because in his blog he is only too honest about his anger about the management of the company - one thing is for sure: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Those who lead an online life are what they reveal themselves to be - in a way, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And if you try to keep something secret, or even bypass Google's monopoly, you can do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that, although accessing Google's search engine, deliberately leaves no traces.
Quite a few people deliberately don't register on community sites so they can't be found, but Google's online applications, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can also deal with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore don't generate the best possible profile from the user.
Public opinion, however, is anxiously waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising space is threatening the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly rapid introduction of services is causing worry not only to Microsoft but also to other software developers.
However, critical observers also find the disturbing counter-poles: for example, the corporate management has completely rejected a protest by the employees after the company's own kindergarten fees have doubled, and management also said that the staff's multiple meals are too expensive. However, all this seems to be mildly opposed to Google even falling to the knees in 2006 in front of the Chinese government and agreeing to an agreement that all hits critical of the regime, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal regulation of the Group states that no new service will be advertised in advance, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could again change strongly: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project is now assuming dimensions that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the health system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building up a genetic database already provides the next generation of sci-fi authors with the material - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in best Orwellian manner a future in which a person becomes frighteningly approachable thanks to data obtained from Google.
Two young people help Ózd’s double killer to remove traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people suspected of helping to remove the traces, the spokesman of the police commissariat Borsod announced on Tuesday.
The young people were competent and are currently being charged with aid.
According to the news agency MTI, they are two girls who defend themselves at large.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several persons out of greed for money.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor to a site in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act by a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances surrounding its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Provides Buying Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that the Poles had put in spite of the fact that they were formerly excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, intends to sell more than 60% of the shares in the coming months.
According to reports of the Czech daily "E15", the offer of the Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the newspaper, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25% stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis on Tuesday, some of the leading European newspapers already spoke of the "second 11 September".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, for example "La Repubblica" - the president had not even been able to put his own party behind him for the bill, which should bring some relief into the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor," as the billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11."
Parts of the Madrid press also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is the reason why the global economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from this.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congressional vote, there is a risk that Washington will have no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example the Geneva "Tages-Anzeiger".
While some states could still provide bailouts to their troubled financial institutions, banks with taxpayers’ money could save them from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to jump over their shadow and centralise control over money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weakening financial institutions, the Vienna "Der Standard" recalls. Moreover, according to the newspaper, the concerns are more and more realistic that after the Americans, the European taxpayers now have to dig a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping over the old continents like a tsunami.
While the "savers" would not have to "weddle" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new accident prevention technologies if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
Like the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan an amazing project was presented, in which the Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in the creation of new systems to avoid accidents.
In collaboration with the Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system controlled by car robots, a mini car equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private sector", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled spacer.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the car robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the appropriate angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver is purely instinctive.
"If it weren't, the car robot couldn't react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered unavoidable.
The entire process must reflect the behavior of bees when avoiding other bees.
And this has to take place in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to bees, dodging cannot take place up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only towards the changeability of the tires.
While the bees here have endless possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotational motion of the car robot, respectively acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer lifetime than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It doesn't have to save them, or produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous maneuvers, so it's constantly using only a handful of KB memory.
There's no need for gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan believes will be standard production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the destination.
A Name for the Sinning Child
Now, the written version of the $700 billion bailout package law is available, which will be applied in several stages and aims to purchase the banks' bad loans.
In the first passage half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time East Coast, Congressmen went through several days of debate to reach an agreement on the $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, and said that the agreement had to be put on paper.
Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain - supported the compromise reached on the bailout package.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson commented on the result: the program will be effective and it will be efficient, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing the helm of the economy around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening at 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger an altitude flight on the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Deputies will vote first on the 2008 bill to stabilise the economy, then the Senate will vote.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on buying rotten, loan-loaded securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the sum of 700 billion is to be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit-burdened, bad securities, and the President is to decide on the additional USD 100 billion.
The programme will be reviewed by a Commission of its own, which will also be consulted by the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, mortgages, mortgages, or other "poisonous" loans.
As competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds and the companies pay the costs corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be provided as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We'll take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it's signed, says Paulson.
However, the bosses of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect that their handlings, which are called "Golden Handshake" salopp in the overseas slang, will be cut off by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance assists each other.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry purchases at an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the retired bank manager is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the bad loans, the government will engage aggressively to ensure that the manager salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that more people will participate in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the rescued bank gets better.
The bill states that the president will have to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were sceptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That is not what American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, says the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven by the same people who were also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Like the Central Statistics Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.

Domestic sales prices have risen only marginally, i.e. by 0.1 percent, compared to the previous month.
Sales prices in the manufacturing industry also rose only little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly for bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, for shoes the prices went up by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and productions (1.6 percent).
Price decreases were recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the major domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly as a result of the gas price increase introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in comparison with the previous year, crude oil processing prices have risen most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
A fall in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The level of inflation in the other manufacturing industries ranged from 0.6 to 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2% last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in the capital goods sector in August (0.7 percent).

In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent was noted, and in the fixed goods sector a price reduction of 1.4 percent was noted.
Industrial export prices in Forint rose by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but fell by 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency fell by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, by 7.1 percent compared to the dollar, and compared to August 2007, it grew by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, and by 15.9 percent compared to the dollar.
No visa to the USA from 2009 onwards?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister explained to the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is being introduced in time overseas."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be conducting negotiations in Washington from today.
She will meet Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" to the Republic of Hungary, and she will also have talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank bailout package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the finance minister.
After day-long marathon consultations on Sunday morning, the Congress and government representatives announced that they had reached an agreement on the banking rescue package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than their opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama has been able to further expand its lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain's high, which brought him the presentation of vice president Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has melted away at the same time.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We need to act now, responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened," he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic visions "obsolet".
In an interview given to the ABC channel, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time manipulating this (...) but doing nothing is certainly not an alternative".
The Republican senator said that the plan also required the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of handling for top managers - something he had insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so comments "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution Destroys Their Fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from it.
The break of the epoch is also a problem of Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but something has come to an end on Sunday, which, however, was already quite exactly ten years ago: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
Last but not least, the CSU's consistent modernization in the federal state has destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but they estimated themselves at a considerable pace. However, the secularization, the educational success, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with the expansion of options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and more idiosyncratic.
It is striking that in recent weeks the classical groups of citizens have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with high school qualifications such as university degrees.
Here the support of the CSU decreased to even less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative daily Wiener Tageszeitung reports on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections in its "Who with whom? Party leaders cautiously on coalition issues".
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids interference of the SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to talks, while the Greens do not yet want to commit themselves to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it is all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders hardly allowed their cards to be seen.
SPÖ CEO Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP head as Vice Chancellor.
As he said, the voters voted off the Schüssel-Molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would not be possible.
However, Molterer reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation cannot be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition or the coalition is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ CEO Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take over government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun, which is being hosted by the Presidency of the European Union, France.
In her speech addressed to the plenary session, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP of the European People's Party, drew attention in particular to the educational segregation, which is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, and was also the main obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizens' organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to Fidesz' press office, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the search for a job, the Roma were primarily displaced from the labour market because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have middle school education, and due to poor primary education, only a small part of them can obtain a university degree."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which would play a key role in asserting other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU member states.
In the view of the House, it is important that a broad circle - Roma and non-Roma - should be aware of these links.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the more his or her chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and turnover tax they contribute to national spending.
"As EU citizens, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated education must be stopped", said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, target- and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the disengagement process in the education sector, which requires proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment, and give Roma children the democratic means to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully entitled citizen," Járóka said.
Since last year's congress in Berlin, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national, level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are rolling for the time being, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes will be decided at the extraordinary party congress last October weekend.
However, the much-pulled duo already made it clear that it does not want to stick on their armchairs.
With this they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career peak - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was a "one-stop-shop" in Bavaria, which generated 18 percent of German GDP.
While the conservatives remain the dominant force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party's internal restructuring, the potential successor Huber, Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which will conduct exploratory talks with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free Voter" about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list "Free Voters" the Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duo first exploited, in order to then mercilessly dump the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings out of the background, will play an active role. Former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman named September 28 the "worst day of his political career".
On Monday Huber made some poisonous remarks towards CDU - in his opinion the CSU would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to the success at national level in 2005, should not be put back on its feet with a joint act of strength, Merkel cannot again become chancellor after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment about the fiasco, believes that the CSU's loss of terrain will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result to date in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegality in counting votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
Despite the fact that the 10 million resident state has been without opposition for decades, the opposing party under the name of "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) has seriously hoped before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who had renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "let" some opposition members in parliament this time.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on Russia thanks to the rising prices of gas imports, and loans have even been made to ease price increases, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the country’s leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. Therefore, in the context of the opposition’s expectations, there was the hope that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians banned entry into the EU due to the political system classified as anti-democratic.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections provided a temporary relaxation, in which the emphasis was on positive movements rather than on shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticised the campaign on Monday - so oppositionists are unlikely to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, for example, and Minsk is even willing to engage in smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine has been a federal state on paper, has considered the two territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to continue, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one opposition candidate into parliament".
The opposition does not plan to protest in the light of the results, but rather tries to make clear to voters the need for economic reform.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in our way in distributing, but I still see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones," Milinkevich said, alluding to the fact that not even the most heavily supported pensioners agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" that reminds of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," says Milinkevich.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Ria Novosti, the news agency, "People believe the actions, not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those smart people who first stamp and then go to coffee during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
">"Turnable doors are a means to increase work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," stresses Brunetta once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi the installation ends in all buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value."
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
The Minister of Rome announces that "in three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people per year are present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"whose wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and well above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter the Brunetta Decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is standing out with figures about lower absenteeism at work - the Consumer Centre writes - the people of the 'working lazy' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have joined forces to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which verification visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day, 2500 accidents at work occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain inactive for life.
For 2007, data from the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul Lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will celebrate the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work in all the provinces of Italy, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to aid the families of the victims and to raise public opinion".
"An outraged "basta" has risen to this; understandable in tragedies, which, measured by their magnitude, trigger some vortex in the media and public participation. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events, which can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness of the school framework by young people who are nourishing the world of work are particularly important.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to divert attention from its social seriousness. It is necessary to put into effect and improve a legislative norm.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"Data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not rule out the fact that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," stresses Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention, which is exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"We believe that you are doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against it through various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting at school."
"Another effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that constitutes a social emergency is in demand."
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of industrial accidents" and denounced the "abolition of the social system against which we are fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return a guarantee to the employee on insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an industrial accident does not depend on voluntary or random donations, which are currently decided by a legislator."
Mp3 player under charge: danger of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the EU's Csrseri (scientific committee on current and recently identified health risks) in a report published today in Brussels.
"The report states that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music equipment for at least five years a week for more than one hour a day risk permanent loss of hearing," says one comment.
"I am worried that such a large number of young people, who usually place portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – as it is said on the part of the European Union – there is a clear risk that pushes too fast action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information a common good.
In the light of these scientific findings, we must review the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"Scientists - the EU communication concludes - confirm that there is a legitimate concern and that the European Commission, together with the other EU members and stakeholders, will now investigate the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music equipment and similar equipment ".
There is already a European standard which limits the level of noise from portable music equipment to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could result from too much noise pollution.
This damage can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the Eu points out that when users of portable music devices hear loud (more than 89 decibels) music only five hours a week, so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This is 5-10 % of users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We'll start today, it's supposed to be over in March, we'll take stock in June.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". This morning, the Commission met in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the leadership lines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City and Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," says Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, the political leaders of which remain the city council and the municipal council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
Their task will be completed in March and the Commission will be dissolved, as such a project must have a time-defined end point.
In June - as the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Anyone who questions the Commission's competence, given that it lacks a sense of commitment, responds to Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in mind, in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
The Lord Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think; it will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step into the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which "will not only be limited to the current local borders, but will look much further", not only in terms of the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician, who is keen to be seen as independent, has written: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-american president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the economy of the USA and maintained relations with the hostile Islam (and still does so today as a private person)".
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more intense, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators!".
Actually, however, these attacks don't have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big head start.
In this case, too, there are people talking to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the poll booth will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice to.
Here a mentality of the USA is revealed, which was kept hidden up to the last.
"If you say what you want, then we'll decide who we're going to do, whether for Obama or McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains Bush's weak point for the majority.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not express any real concern to those in charge of the information because of the general credibility.
You don't feel alone like you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
Added to this are the major problems caused by the cuts to the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to put the newspaper together.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the journalists interviewed – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear, but complicated pessimism today fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, executives account for as much as 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web is going.
The most important publishing groups make their way into the Internet, which is regarded by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "it will bring something good for journalism".
The biggest crack in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors at national level are sure their reporters share their values with them, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "security at work".
Managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", note d. Red.) is always a current topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers offer as they like it and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The editors get very often very high wages, but the editor can sometimes only get 10000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As far as holidays are concerned, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, in order to finally reach 15 days of holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they admit themselves, will often become "sick" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROM COURT: DANILO COPPOLA LEAVES IN GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Court’s Second Trial Chamber in Rome, has decided to reject the real estate agent’s request to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is investigated against Coppola for Bankrot in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into an obligation to stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to move from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecutor's office had appealed) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence suing him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House's 700 billion savings package: a large part of Americans were and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's issue of the New York Times, which tells of how the crisis in progress divides the Republican party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and business community, and those neoconservatives that are hostile to "those in Washington" and to the financial world and, above all, win voters in the south and the centre of states.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example, just mentioned, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake heralds or even already represents: not only in the US, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond it, will they be affected.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the long-afraid events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis is a decline of the banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This is an immediate political problem for governments: how to deal with the families concerned, which are also an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis thus appears economically global, whereas politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen into disrepute and lost its right to speak: the clear proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into different national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and above all distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became ever more serious, only the US is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two conditions that cannot be overvalued – under certain circumstances – which no international organisation or market will otherwise be able to rely on in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance which has recently been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is just now that we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked empire, a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we must suddenly discover how our future will depend more and more on essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to the other of the world, but they are still extremely connected to a closely defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in favor of another who lives in an area without harvest, without water or without oil.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short insertion.
Who territory, who government, who says politics, thus also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to generate two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leaderships, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy that have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
In addition, there is a deeper and, in a sense, even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, all of which is directed at a whole class of Western managers.
The conviction among large sections of the population seems to be paving the way for the fact that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is more and more alien and traditional to the majority.
The demand for leadership is thus fueling a branched but powerful movement of the disempowerment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the sudden reversal of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, towards the rebellion of the American deputies against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value regarding what is going on in the lower social classes of the West today and is being intensified by the financial crisis and driven to over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a "rebelion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide is certainly not.
The superglue that blows up walls
Defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have almost reached its goal.
With an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 qcm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a body weighing 100 kg on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal, has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged into a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the ability to hold the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "to remove them from the wall without problems", says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe so, but the researchers think of a less fascinating use, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other fields of application could fall into the space sector.
So for now, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – the University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that, like hair, clean themselves from dust by moving on a surface and thus always maintain perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Be careful of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time as certain vital medicines, since they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaging as well as fresh fruit juices associated with drug intake. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again sounded the alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines to the extent that they are virtually eliminated and thus endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICALS IN DRIVER – In a report two years ago, the same agency had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix and stressed the need to take care of what is being drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepan or metadon.
IT IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change the consumer information.
It is therefore advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there is still some uncertainty, to ask a pharmacist or doctor", the expert of the Ansa Agency stresses.
Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial from the New York Times that this second event was more crucial to the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction that received quite a few polemics in response and that was kept before the economist years later, but is now proving to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the Bush administration's excessive liberalism."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of OpenOffice.org 3.0's release has come; the open source software, as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with some novelties: in addition to a revised and now more spartan designed initial menu, a completely guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x has finally been achieved, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version, given.
In addition, the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice, has been improved.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e.g. sending via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time to preserve the original appearance of the page.
So you can now also generate "hybride" PDF files, which extend the typical graphic of Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system.
The collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by several users, avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, a question is assigned to each editor in order to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently publishing various OpenOffice functions on the Internet (on the cloud), while the definitive result is to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
However, if cost-freeness can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is also particularly in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed in the big leap: after all, various public administration and school institutions have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program which aims at a displacement of Excel; Impress, to create presentations like with PowerPoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the more known access; and lastly Draw, a graphics module.
The objective for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Also cabbage tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up as part of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, the third-classed and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver to be positively tested for Cera, the third generation Epo. Previously, this was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of cabbage are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
The counter-tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
Pierre Bordry, head of the French anti-doping commission, confirmed the positive epotest and, according to the Associated Press, also informed the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber.
THEME IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES: IS ITALY RASSISTICAL?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only accepted with reluctance.
Does this make Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and job opportunities" exist, yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North is recorded".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900-Euro per room high rental prices
The housing market for students knows no crises.
According to the recent investigation of the Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious features, and large numbers of students are in fact losing their right to study, as their families are not able to support them at this level," said the Sunia officials, Laura Mariani, "in these cities, the high demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized subletting.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices by revising taxation.
A closer look at the study shows that in Milan, a sleeping space in the Brianza district is needed for about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera districts, or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a sleeping place, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighbourhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the districts around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who dodge in the suburbs can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting out to non-European students is more frequent, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents, which are 25-30% above the average, are demanded by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema – the cities close their historical cinemas
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of the exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means death in the long run for the one-room cinema in the centre. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
It's mostly historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you've covered a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which 20 years ago earned him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes. It's the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures supplied by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: over the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; most of these mines paid for cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years Lombardy leads the lists, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "although it is useful that new structures also emerge, the first priority is the preservation of the already existing one, because a hall in the city closes, not all its regular customers are ready to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here the lack of budget for the fund of the trade association remains outside eight: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to approximately 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed".
It is interesting to note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, due to its fears about the old cinemas, has decided to protect it through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the planned measures are also tax breaks for cinema operators and benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be possible to travel to the traffic-limited areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a positive initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also develop new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because after all, the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to avoid seeing the dusty posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the community's decisions to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations made by the Anti-Mafia Office of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the Municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
In handcuffs were also taken Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the clan's boss, had already been sentenced for involvement in criminal mafia associations, at that time to a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"Regarding any moral and legal norm," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
"Thus it was made possible for the mafia group – according to the judges – to enter the town halls officially and to co-determine the politics of the public administration."
The President of the Calabrian Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who maintain a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, Gioia Tauro’s municipal council had been dissolved, but as early as 1991 – and also then due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration – local politicians had been deprived of their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 election.
He screamed scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He was accused of inventing everything for political-strategic reasons in the Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, but the judges stated in connection with this morning's arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
A listening campaign in connection with the Dal Torrione case investigation has shown a willingness to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large Piromalli group – making public administration measures identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, suddenly the big ones come up
It is a non-drinking source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now do the world's major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also seeking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from ocean movements has been considered and investigated for 70 years; not by chance have these studies intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gassed, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy needs could be met by the energies generated by ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to twice the energy produced by nuclear power plants at the moment.
In addition, there are currents and tides.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are now relying on marine energy production.
"Chevron investigates these technologies," says the spokesman of a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, and weighs the opportunity to work with us."
This is about obtaining approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially given that oil is still being mined by the US in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; even if the details are not known, observers speak of an increasing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still emerging, not least because the last doubts have not yet been clarified by environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimensions and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via piston and cylinder.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this type, which are only waiting for state approval, and some of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
However, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a park latz using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotation.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Production Research, a particular interest deserves the potential that lies in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
It is tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
