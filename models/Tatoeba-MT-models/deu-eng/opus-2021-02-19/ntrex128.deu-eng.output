Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament) gives rise to dismay.
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to 'Welsh Parliament'.
National Assembly members of all political directions fear to become the target of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party National Assembly said that his group was concerned because the name rhymes with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.
For non-walisian readers: in Welsh "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" stands for "Aa".
A national assembly member of the party Plaid Cymru stated that the whole group was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Committee), which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: "The final decision on designations for members of the National Assembly is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which resulted in broad support for the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
With regard to the titles of the members of the National Assembly, the panel preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, while the MWP option was the most widely supported at a public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly seem to suggest alternative options, but the struggle for consensus could be a problem for Chairman Elin Jones, who is to present a bill within weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members of the National Assembly and the design of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may vote definitively on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed to 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The referendum was scheduled to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the similar name Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim applies to the Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the popular vote on the name change, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Adams.
"Today there is no more either."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People's social lives look different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves."
With the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will "be at the beginning sooner or later".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with condominiums where people do not support the remaining refuges.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation holding their services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support blacks.
During a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's community members planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the carillon as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who rang the glockenspiel in July used other words: 'a treasure of culture' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had changed to the larger carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, some of whom were brought in by the church's lay leaders and some by the bishop's diocese.
In July, the municipal board – the leadership of the community consisting of lay leaders – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass the costs on to the municipal board, although it was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injured in California 13-year-old diving after Lobstern
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, a shark reportedly attacked a 13-year-old boy diving for Lobster.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the TV channel KSB in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and paddled with several others to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought at first that the boy was happy to have caught a praiser, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I have been bitten!
I have been bitten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy's house, he found that his entire collarbone had been torn open.
“I cried out that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’,” Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The nature of the shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks before. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks boots, superdrugs and debenhams with department stores-like cosmetics departments filled with specialized assistants.
As part of a large-scale advance to the UK £2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow while fashion and household goods sales are declining, the larger cosmetics departments are being tested nationwide in eleven stores, and if they prove successful, they will be expanded to include more stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for ways to use store space previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, for the first time, the scope of his cosmetics offer doubles to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like Boots.
In addition, the supermarket is carrying out a relaunch of its "boutique" makeup series, so that most of the products are more vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury's branch outlets. The first sales outlet was opened last week in Croydon, south London, and a second will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since buying the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has set up hundreds of Argos retail outlets and a number of habitat outlets, which has increased food sales and profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket's previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, which ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drug dealer's stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the tempting environment and the favourable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases that questions the way in which we have been shopping so far."
Peter Jones "infuriated" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a £11 million business
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is "happy" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a £11 million business with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The "This Morning" presenter, 37, announced her withdrawal on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered "Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones through her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new follow-up contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "infuriated" when television's "Golden Girl" at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to their new businesses – worth up to £1.5 million – they would not be able to devote enough time to the common homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would likely have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Great Britain on his way to one of his holiday destinations.
One source said: “Truly was by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure their future for them in the long term over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw came as a surprise to all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the market launch.
At the Marlow headquarters, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" presenter, one of the UK's most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV show "I'm A Celebrity".
A Jones-affiliated source said last night: "We are not commenting on his business affairs."
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would regard as "non-presidential" and for such positive statements about North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news host:
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have stalled.
Over three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's supreme diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not see a "corresponding response" to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the US maintained sanctions that were intended to sustain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and return of the mortal remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population were displaced by Lombok, no national emergency was declared, a condition for mobilizing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international support, so that is a bit difficult," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work locally.
Sutopo, spokesman for the Civil Protection Agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international agencies should participate in the relief efforts.
In the face of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country remains sadly ill-prepared for natural forces.
While Tsunamis shelters were built in Aceh, these are not an everyday sight on other coastal areas.
The apparently missing tsunami warning in Palu, despite a warning that came into force, probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia's numerous islands is already a challenge in the best case scenario.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the location of the new disaster in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesian infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, who is seeking re-election next year, is suffering from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from persistent religious tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes and homes when gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scored a low score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London with a hit in the 89th minute.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at his team's 0:1 residue about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the rear post.
The shot sailed high above the penalty room and drifted into the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"I was just trying to get myself into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to save as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw ledge coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
After a hit in the 25th minute, Chelsea led by the Belgian star Eden Hazard to the half time with 1-0.
The Blues-Stürmer gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the midfield.
After that, he shot a good pass, so Hazard got into the penitentiary.
Hazard left the defenders behind and ended up in the net with a left-wing shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play at the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Civil Protection Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to be trapped in the rubble of buildings brought down by the 7.5th magnitude earthquake on Friday, which had caused waves up to six metres high, reported the government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, for murder suspicion after a woman has been stabbed
After the discovery of a female corpse this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police are asking residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask all those who have been near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have made contact with a Dashcam. Perhaps they have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing, and the police informed her that she is in the process of informing the next relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours before they can enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the place of the event.
It repeats over and over again, 'this is so terrible'.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the barrier and another vehicle was in front of the barrier.
Within the barrier were several police officers who monitored the apartment block.
Persons with information are requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and refer to record number 247 dated 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament is the latest monument to the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatic puritan adherents, reminiscent of the Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue was targeted at the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell neither ordered nor carried out the image storm in the English civil wars.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the history of a figure who, in the opinion of many, is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, as someone who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate presentation is the subject of continued historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and reminding of them."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, to whom only the surname "Yuan" was named, was found dead with a severed artery blood-flooded near a pig shed at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30th, 2005.
He had reportedly arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with blood on his snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilo pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin, to whom the surname "Wu" was named, was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Photos from a security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to either Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent attacks on other people while the police were gathering evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities reportedly negotiate compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 kilo pig stuck a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife was able to scare the animal away.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
“They’re just playful.
They like to tweak and are very curious... they're not looking to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right level of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening on its way across the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will be bringing floods to the rains in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 East Coast Time, Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, heading east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimetres of precipitation in parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity generates widespread rainfall in the southwest due to interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous flooding, water - driving debris and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity sometimes results in precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation is expected.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions is possible.
In view of the impending tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can lead to torrential streams from canyons, and thunderstorms bring local wind gusts and wind that carries dust.
The approaching trough brings local heavy rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation rates of more than one centimetre are possible, which can lead to small amounts of debris floating in the water and to smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four Corners region and lasts Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools down while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the US.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the ongoing summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the USA a warm beginning of October with widespread temperatures around 27 oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the US.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million viewers saw on Thursday on six television networks the compelling statements of the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate continued. On Friday, the TV stations interrupted their regular program due to a last-minute twist: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, according to which the FBI is to conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, harassed her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audiences in offices.
To put this in the right perspective, this roughly corresponds to the number of spectators at a play-off football game or at the Oscar ceremony.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers at the full-day hearing.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras as protesters in the elevator forcefully harassed him with words on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood with his eyes lowered for minutes while he was being scolded. The scene was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"They have power, while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and added it before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee was to vote on the transfer of Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would do so only on condition that the FBI investigates the allegations against the candidate next week as demanded by the democratic minority.
Flake was partly persuaded by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a meeting with Coons and then various senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to withdraw from the European Union of using the future of Britain for political purposes and of undermining the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published alongside the interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit by calling a proposal for the mutual collection of tariffs by Britain and the EU "completely absurd".
Deadly Shots at Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with Death of the LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for manslaughter, according to Baton Rouge police.
The agency released video footage of the clash between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As CBS partner station WAFB reports, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and said that DNA was found on Simpson's glasses.
After Simpson's questioning, the police stated that he had confessed to the fatal shots on Wayde.
The Advocate reports that the deposit has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thanked the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and the local citizens for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the Regional Management Authority for "their diligence and their quest for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played basketball for the LSU.
In the last season he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "deeply shaken" and "stood in shock" about Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wade said.
Volcano spits ashes on Mexico City.
Ashes ejected from the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater had increased and 183 gas and ash ejections were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of resentment and shocks.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windscreens of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity on the 72 km south-east of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 Central Mexico hit in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between the police and Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between the riot police and pro-independence protesters. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were held back by the riot police, threw them with eggs and also threw paint powder, causing dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated by tourists.
In the course of the day there were also handcuffs with the police who used their batons to curb the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiving" while Unionists who called "Long live Spain" faced them.
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was seen by Madrid as illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
The voters had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although the turnout was low, as the opponents of the split boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the Separatist protest, said he saw the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year have had difficulties in maintaining momentum. Many of their best-known leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in prison, waiting for their trials for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament election next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the dismantling of democratic values and oppression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been hit several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, a crossbow might have shot the car.
Menga hit means 1-0 victory over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's match proved to be crucial for Gary Holt's team to match Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season without an away win and will face the Hearts next Sunday, which are eight points behind.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his division victory to six games, which means that head coach Holt has not lost since his takeover of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against bold-playing guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the match, as his directness posed the Rangers with a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the goal. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, as they knew that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive gate came into being.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a chance where Declan Gallagher and Robinson put Menga in gunshot position together, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the middle of the penitentiary.
In this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but could not overcome the defenses of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unaffected.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was kicked off by Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor, and Lithgow sled the ball from another Livingston standard situation.
The flanks repeatedly entered Livingston's penitentiary and were regularly removed from the danger area, while two sought-after penalties – one from Halkett against Glenn Middleton and one from Handspiel – were denied.
Phenomenal from Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and exceeded expectations in this upward trend again.
Her playing style and team have hardly changed since she returned to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has woken up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on the move throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerrard at times, they could not achieve this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the host’s team – and that’s something like a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Received Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) there were smiling faces and blue skies when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then travelled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police mentioned security reasons for stopping a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also made themselves heard. They condemned Erdogan’s policies as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and reproached by others as autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
In a collision with a car, a cyclist died in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics took care of the man, who died at the scene of the accident.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had been killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about one mile from the Saturday accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his nearest relatives.
Road closures and diversions for buses are set up and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officials Injured in Riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a men's high security prison.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still continuing.
Specialised "Tornado" officials have been called in to stop the riots involving eight inmates who are confined to one wing.
The officers were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel were deployed to resolve an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer periods behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in the hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, police officers were called to the prison to deal with serious riots in which the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding (drought areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert-shaped southwest and bring the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flooding on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada and to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and will cross Phoenix directly on Tuesday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close to Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with occasional up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimetres are likely and occasionally possible up to 10 centimetres in total.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the precipitation associated with pink may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, some of this rain is likely to be useful, as drought is currently in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First of all, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will hit land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Afterwards, the hurricane will move north with 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and thereby weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
Rainfall can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation amounts of 7.5 to 15 centimetres are expected, with up to 25 centimetres possible," said weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border in early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move up through Arizona to the south of Utah until late Tuesday night.
"The main danger associated with pink or its remains is very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-shaped southwest of the US," the National Hurricane Center said.
As a result of these precipitations, landslides are expected in the desert, as well as floodlike floods and debris floating in the water, as well as in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked all those who had records of what happened on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "under the gloom, the anger" of the Democrats.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and outrageous tactics of the Democrats," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "under the gloom, anger" of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he had sexually harassed her decades ago when both teenagers were teenagers.
Ford also testified to her accusation at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in service to the general public," he said to the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not kicking in, but in reality I'm kicking in," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission as "resistance and blocking".
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate by Friday at the latest, said a senior staff member of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, victims rising
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swept away when gigantic waves hit the beaches due to a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when at night up to six meters high waves hit the beach, tearing many people to death and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people still went to the beach and did not run away immediately, and they fell victim to it," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency (BNPB) at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it flooded cars, logs and houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people had climbed trees on the run from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos published by the Civil Protection Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) stated in a statement that the energy released during the massive quake of Friday corresponded to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have become bigger, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and stated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
According to Nugroho, communication with Donggala was completely paralysed and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the authorities were often criticized for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official data.
Amateur footage published on social media shows a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the street beneath him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall crawls onto the shore and sweeps buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not check the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The quake and tsunami caused a massive power outage, which interrupted communication around Palu and made the authorities more difficult to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still urgently need food and other essential goods.
The city's airport remains closed until October and was reopened only for relief.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tent shelters in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Dosaba, they passed scenes of devastation on the way.
"They said they saw numerous destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Also, when the relief groups began their hard work to initiate disaster relief, some moaned that expert foreign helpers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, deliveries and personnel from abroad are only possible when the location of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That has not happened so far.
"At the moment, it is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but until now this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing hoped for one of the miracles that lighten up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian matches that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, as Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders, he had desperately sent WhatsApp news to the competitors from Palu who took part in the beach festival.
His messages, however, led to grey question marks instead of blue checkmarks.
"I think this means that the news has not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a news release by Newport police, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, a Brink’s employee was stealing $26,750 from an ATM.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to raise more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was employed, "a man came running behind the employee of Brink's" and stole a bag of money intended for the machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but the police did not state how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons with information on the identity of the suspects are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
At the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (Das officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his performance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears on the show as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, cancelled for 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but according to his own statement it has a religious significance for West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said this year in a conversation about his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, it is we.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, became just ‘Ye’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album rather reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but announced this year that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West used to work, has already written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the bloody reprisals against students in his country.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised to "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were in the process of establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans through monthly grants for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to criminal gangs.
USA should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even if the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are so far behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough," said Lee.
Doubling the financial resources could double the chances that the next major AI success would be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-placed American Othello player. Later, he was senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised earlier US government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the timing of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee says that researchers in the US often have to work hard to get state subsidies.
"It's not China that takes the top academics away, it's companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI.
Lee believes that a change in the US immigration policy could also help the US's AI efforts.
"I think that in the field of AI doctorates, people should automatically be offered green cards," he said.
China's State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan) in July 2017.
According to Lees, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science are said to be involved. In addition, the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of 2 billion US dollars in the initiative "AI Next".
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, nothing has happened in US laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would settle a decade-old dispute with Greece which had blocked Macedonia's applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is made to the Greek territory. Therefore, Greece has vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents argue, however, that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign casts doubt that voter turnout will reach the 50 per cent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price of joining organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, since it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would stick to the result so that it is crucial.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said that there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 per cent of registered voters had cast their votes.
"I am here to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will vote in the referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia on the change of the country's name, which would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in much-needed investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
He said that a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote 'yes'.
For the referendum to succeed, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took power last May.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvers through the entire Brighton defense to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton in the 2-0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian attacker received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defense players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around one defender and then overtook several more defenders at the edge of Brighton's prison.
He then shot a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Brighton goaltender Mathew Ryan with his right shoe and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems in his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We had talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
It was Sterling, however, who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank of Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues Attacker aimed the ball into the net just before it slipped into the out.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim.
Joke wants to spoil the game for the Rockies
As the Nationals left the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
However, the ever-powerful joker hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies, who have a lead in the NL West over the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere of the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level I would encounter this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but according to reports they are inclined to throw jokers in such a situation.
Joke, for whom this would be the 34th bet as starting player, practiced on Thursday in the bullpen and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington right-winger has a statistics of 18-7 this season, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation in connection with the Brett Kavanaugh, whom he had chosen for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the Republican electorate's participation in the interim elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones – I'm not kicking in, but in reality I'm kicking in, so I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by all means, you see the meanness, the abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get the power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The democrats, he said, saw their mission as 'resistance and blocking'.
'And you see this in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'infuriated and mean and despicable and dishonest.'
He named the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate's Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused loud booze in the audience.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you let the document go outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour does not allow all opinions to apply.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came as little surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MEPs to be told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way, because she was energetically opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for taking a different view than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, about which Jeremy was not in agreement with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that 'meetings should involve everyone and be productive'.
Most of the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'more friendly, more cautious' policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is judged on whether it is accepted by the party leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy became party leader. Colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views now expected me to turn around and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – there is a scolding ad on social media calling for my election, denouncing the political centre and saying that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me are mostly of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face a flood of sexist or racist abuses every day, and yet never give in to it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn demanded last week that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every motion of censure and any change to the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to move my head in and not express my opinion so clearly, and then I would 'have no problems'.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom in general school literally fell apart, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most – as municipal councillor as well as cabinet minister.
I have never made a secret from my political views, not even in the last election.
Nobody in Nottingham East could be in any way unclear about my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say the following to the supporters of Friday's proposal: given that the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I am not sending this one message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, regardless of whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no matter how many ballot threats or political purposeful thinking will prevent me from acting in the best interest of all of you in my opinion.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams to be unbeaten at the top of the league.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to their superior defenses as well as their better exploitation of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been put to the test in our games so far, and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have made better use of their chances than we have."
Grant Anderson’s 14th minute attempt, raised by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead. However, due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released from the Warriors for the game, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot caught a non-increased attempt.
Climo extended the leadership of Ayr with a penalty kick, before he scored a hit right at half time and then scored a single-handedly increased attempt, so that it stood 17:5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose, however, started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Subsequently, there was a prolonged interruption due to a severe injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the playing field. After the sequel, Ayr expanded his lead by an attempt by Stafford McDowall increased by Climo.
Then Blair Macpherson, who was the captain of Ayr, received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose had the additional man paid for by a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tacking without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty lane behind the advancing Ayr package.
Climo increased as before almost since the break, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's boxkick and sent off flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems ready for a change to the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was named as managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the leading roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow's "florant restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, enclosed by land, hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz, decorated with dewwork.
There's a sea-blue flag blowing on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Titicacasee to Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our rightful property.
Winning it back is a duty."
Everywhere in land-locked Bolivia, the memory of the stretch of coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still as alive as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice to be delivered on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and naturally expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Throughout the country, many Bolivians will follow the ruling of the IGH on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia after decades of sporadic discussions.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is about to face a controversial fight for his re-election next year, there is also a lot at stake in Monday's verdict.
"We are on the verge of returning to the Pacific," he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would not change much.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, is not authorised to assign Chilean territory and has specified that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, the fact that the judgment of the ICC is already available six months after the closing argument suggests that the case was "not complicated".
Far from supporting Bolivia’s case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has raised the question of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She indicated that Morales' warlike rhetoric has suffocated any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their talks, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia has "an exceptional opportunity to herald a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "bring an end to the 139-year-long disputes for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to translate into action the promises made during a summit between the leaders of rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to re-launch the stuck nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and US resistance to a declaration to end the Korean war would ever bring the North to its knees as "brain-crazy."
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking substantial disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renunciation of an arsenal in which the country is likely to see the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headgear, which will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer need to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of crazy oversized headgear on the catwalk for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their spectacular creations over the catwalk.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige-coloured hat with a feather-like wide edge that almost crushed the models' heads.
As additional oversized accessories, watermelons, a magician's hat and even a pineapple were shown with jewels. However, these are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn on lips and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with 60 cm wide edge, which from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski all wear.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that hit big waves on social media sent another great creation over the catwalk: a beach bag made of straw that was almost as big as the swimsuit-carrying model that held the bag.
The bast bag in reddish orange with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' Summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has caused so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore."
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence. This continued with further outstanding exam results in 2018 and is only underpinned by individual and shared successes in the fields of sports, art, music and other joint ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide their students and their parents with the highest possible level of care.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as elective subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year's exam show that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the independent school rankings.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved grade A at the higher examinations.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of Mandarin students achieved grade A at the higher examinations, while 72 per cent of German learners also achieved grade A at the higher examinations, 69 per cent of French learners and 63 per cent of Spanish learners.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, engineering, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons that employers gave for the problems of filling vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more vacancies require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people a lead over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak several languages, in particular languages from developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more traditional modern languages, while other languages that are considered most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese, will teach.
Wherever your child's interests lie, in independent schools, there will always be a number of languages to choose from with suitably specialised teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future looks like.
At this time in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, which is why this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication capacity."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James compete for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait soon comes to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the preseason opening game.
However, how many minutes he will play is not yet clear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably only play for a few minutes.
Early this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games to prepare myself at this stage of my career," he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five rallies planned for next week, including in his benevolent places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the pending vote on confirmation of his election to the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump's rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can follow Trump's rally in West Virginia online as a live stream on YouTube below.
Trump will probably address the hearings of the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh to allegations of sexual misconduct that have been conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on confirmation remains in motion for up to a week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main aim of this series of demonstrations is to support Republicans who face difficult elections in November.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies will serve next week to "mobilize volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Control over Congress is so important for his plans that the President will travel in as many states as possible as the campaign season is approaching," said a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to name him, to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania" could participate in the rally planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and report media from Pittsburgh.
The Saturday visit is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to support West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has been polled.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team of the USA shows readiness to fight to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-man games on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the Momentum is a pure invention as a sport concept, but one in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were in the lead with six points, and now there are four, so I think that means a little momentum for us," Jordan Spieth said when leaving the venue.
Europe is, of course, in advantage and four points ahead, while twelve others follow.
According to Spieth, however, the Americans feel a bit of wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each have three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the tee to the green and sets a good example.
The guttural screams of enthusiasm became louder in the course of his round, when he sank an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both after he and Thomas had moved back after two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for them, triggered a similar scream that suggests that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really have to kneel in and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That is all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, thus undoubtedly writing the story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only pair that had not beaten Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the exuberant crowd underscore that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously at different holes.
But speaking of European fame would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-man hero of the morning who played with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swedes in a clamp that they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of trouble.
The pairs of fours and fours are so fascinating to look at from close by because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way a strategy can change at lightning speed.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day. However, this round of four has also shown that the team of the USA is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, had questioned.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is 10:6 ahead of the United States after the fours and fours matches on Saturday, and has a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari advanced with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods and was able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to win back the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the fours in the morning against the faulty American team and won the series with 3:1.
The U.S. won two matches, but failed to make up for the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were christened "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, won four points in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they worked very well and beat the disenchanted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more powerful 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the fours in the morning, returned and played the fours as a partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris not everything ran according to their ideas.
The triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours, beating Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it only happened twice that a team came back after it had gone into the singles with a gap of four points. However, as the title holder for Furyk’s team, a tie is enough to keep the trophy.
After they have been in second place for two days, it doesn't look like they can launch a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea completely rejects unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's Secretary of State told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea last year had "good will to take substantial action", for example stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing itself not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see any response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will by no means disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" approach to denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US President-in-Office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim had promised to work towards the "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is aiming for an official end to the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposes calls for a relaxation of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on "first denuclearization" and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even opposes the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a fantasy of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not respond to plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US head of state had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the other party in the question of denuclearization instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to a standstill."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech differed enormously from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles on the US mainland after "the evil president" Trump Kim had called "the rocket man" on suicide mission.
This year Trump, who had threatened last year with the "total destruction" of North Korea, heaped praise on Kim at the United Nations for his courage with regard to disarmament steps. However, he said that much work was still to be done and that the sanctions had to remain in force until North Korea's denuclearisation.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must in any case continue vigorously until we have achieved full, final and verified denuclearisation."
“The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, on his departure from Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made just to be accused of "gangster-like demands" by North Korea hours later.
North Korea promised to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month when the United States took "appropriate action".
He said that Kim had told him that the intended "appropriate measures" were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to sleep enough in one class
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students in basic studies get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the expanding macho culture of keeping up with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unneeded when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and in his opinion is the first such course in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I find out about this only now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep was. That surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year's first course explained to students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the University's health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a dormitory and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They get information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of lack of sleep on the athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged to think about their daily routine using a map of the university campus with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a "night shift" is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient good sleep should be the "secret weapon" of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. Moreover, weight gain could be avoided as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had taken one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that, in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study programme before starting their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler, students should set an alarm clock for bedtime and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light", which can be triggered by electronic screens and LED lighting, and can break the circadian rhythm, leading to problems when they fall asleep.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1-0: Menga Gate defeats Gerrard's players
The Rangers lost another away match when Dolly Menga's match for Steven Gerrard's disunited team meant a 0-1 defeat to Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard to the second defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team was eight points behind the Hearts leading by far in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before half time, and the low-inspiration Rangers seemed to have no chance of balancing.
While the Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and is only behind Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers also face further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block because of a head wound.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which overtook Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took one point off the Hearts last week, and would have to be enthusiastic about how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure at every turn.
The Rangers dominated ball ownership, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after only two minutes, when Menga's first hand led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal. However, the midfielder missed his chance and shot off.
Then a long free kick of Keaghan Jacobs reached the captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour due to a collision between him and Steven Lawless he should have received a penalty shot, but referee Steven Thomson did not allow the complaints of the Colombian to apply.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's 34th minute hit may not have matched the game's course, there's no denying that they had earned it for their hard work alone.
Once again, the Rangers could not handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent at half time. The change was almost instant effect when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly raced off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game that suits them, with Lithgow and Halkett getting one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor held up well and fought Jacobs off before Lithgow shot a headball from the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also late demanded a penalty kick after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The violinist counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Indeed, I hear a crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" degenerate cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy degenerate cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to detect degenerate cells during treatment.
The method takes immune cells from a patient that are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a lot of cancers common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect degenerate cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method takes immune cells from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2 common to many cancers. Afterwards, the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of removing immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells has helped treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West released a pro-trump tirade after his appearance at SNL, wearing a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had widely praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to compete as a presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", wearing a make-america-Great-Again cap, he continued with a gunfire against the Democrats and again emphasized his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How do you like Trump? He’s racist.’
So if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Justice Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's shambrade was not broadcast, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West with the release.
West also complained to the audience that he had had problems behind the stage because of his headgear.
“They harassed me behind the stage.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
You harassed me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said, "he's going to put on my supermancap, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His remarks triggered at least two calls from the audience, and SNL contributors were embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: "It became dead silent in the studio."
West had been hired late as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture entitled "I Love It", in which he was disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU THAT YOU HAVE DETERMINED THE MASS."
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, adopts an ideology that is harmful to my community and gives it away (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "The being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name into a symbol and then into "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".
Prosecution of attempted murder in connection with stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was injured with a knife at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred according to the police in Ballyhakamore.
The defendant is scheduled to appear before the tribunal in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword-winging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such roles on the screen would cause boys to often feel like they have to be strong in order to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said that he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also a member of "Game of Thrones", also 31 years ago, admitted that solving the problem was "very important to him".
"I personally think the question of what went wrong with masculinity is very important," he said.
"What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now witnessing?"
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives boys the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change this?
Because something has clearly gone wrong with the young men."
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones". He had "enough of battlefields and horses".
As of November, Harington will be featured in a reprint of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best part of "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so I got my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow, with numerous Emmys.
They married on Leslie's family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14°% increase in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In contrast to the past, transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Based on the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, among other things, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked the data of GOP senators, criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied claims on Saturday that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the MP's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat believed that the claims of "ultra-right-wing" experts and websites were being disseminated.
"Lie, lie and even more heinous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, and was published during the hearing of a Senate committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The release took place after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of contributions was associated with Waters’ office and published information from a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temper to be a congressman.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You can't be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Criticism on "Johnny English – You only live three times" – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-coloured new film. This also seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy parody franchise "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spy Who Sifted It" and revived in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now all the more" stuttering.
Will an ironic self-parody on how obviously stupid we are become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the bald-eyed, grimace-cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that he is a general comic creation for moviegoers in the non-English speaking area.
Of course, he's the crazy secret agent again, who bizarrely thinks he's cool and worldly, while in reality he's made up of a little clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a crack of this guy, who made a single note of the title melody of "The Winner's Hour" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos behind travellers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly dangling at his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics comes to light, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" offer in the meantime confidently comedian elements.
The humor seems to be aimed more at children than at adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy mishaps are not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gag in the role of Bean.
The eternally current premise now is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in action, much to the displeasure of the on-duty agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and embroiled figure who is already facing complete collapse because of her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-teresa-may character, but the script doesn't give much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been exposed and that she has to take someone out of retirement.
This includes the clumsy Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic institution, but unofficially gives lessons in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers an espionage academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman of higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always do everything terribly wrong in Her Majesty's secret service, are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta, who is played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque jokes: dressed as waiters, they set a chic French restaurant on fire, they create chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house with a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence all registers are drawn, but as nice and funny as it is, the topic is already discussed in detail on children's television.
Pretty moderate stuff.
Like the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, "Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?"
Labour denies working on a plan for the British to work four days a week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan that requires the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants company leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) to workers in the form of an additional day off.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of workers is "suitable".
The transition to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “Before the end of the year, a policy review is expected to be announced.
"A change will not occur overnight, but a working week of four days is an effort consistent with the party's approach to restoring the economic balance for the benefit of workers and with the general industrial policy strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not about party politics and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "profitmakers" in public utilities.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get their entire share back, as a Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the boards of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of private company equity to employees who pay annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy in the news magazine "60 Minutes" say whether the investigation of the FBI in the Kavanaugh case could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the results of the authority could influence Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that could eventually change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I announced at the trial that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
"My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and a bomb would have to burst," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett vehemently denied this," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all who called it could not confirm it."
It's been 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty as part of this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which is taking place for the 7th time this year, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group is trying to combat poverty by encouraging more and more people to actively participate in poverty reduction.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to do a number of tasks, including actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – combating poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen remains 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of creating a cool free concert a useful way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announced that since 2011, the project has seen more than 19 million actions from its supporters and has achieved various goals.
These actions are said to have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least 10 billion US dollars have already been paid out or raised by fundraising.
According to estimates by the group, the secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between UK-based investors and implementers who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda fight malnutrition in the country with US$35 million after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the project The Power of Nutrition, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the site, namely, what are the reasons why global citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They answered: “It will be a long and exhausting journey with ups and downs.
But like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The US could use the Navy to block Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can use the Navy if necessary to prevent energy from Russia from reaching the markets, including the Middle East, said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s deployment in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently active in these areas at the invitation of the rightful government.
"I think the real reason for Russia's deployment in the Middle East is to negotiate new energy markets, just as in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea routes remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as a "voice of electricity consumers" in the USA.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, finding that they were virtually identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, calling Russia a "One Trick Pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations were made when the Trump administration was in the process of expanding the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, became Moscow's "prisoner."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth USD 11 billion, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received headwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem for a third country to interfere in our energy supply," comments the board of the BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "exactly test" a presidential candidate in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "exactly examine" a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to 'exactly examine' a presidential candidate after 6 November.
During the meeting, Warren said that President Trump was heading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
Warren has not taken a punch in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that before the vote, of course, an FBI investigation is required.
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that they should run for 2020.
According to the survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not stand for candidacy.
32 percent of voters supported such candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a potential candidacy, and 48 percent against.
Among the other names of prominent Democrats eligible for a possible candidacy in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin comments on the Donald Trump Rally on the post-traumatic stress disorder that suffers from track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, all this can be felt by other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an "elephant in the room" and said about her son and other war veterans that they would come back changed, that they would come back more screeched, that they would come back and wonder if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military had given the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support an appeal for new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support an appeal to new U.S. policies that deny asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a court expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who questions politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She announced that her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014 that allowed illegal immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Federal Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of legislation at the state, state and international level".
"The Federal Act requires that all asylum applications are assessed on the basis of the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle," was stated in the court expert statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy refusing immigrants access to the country has an adverse impact on the US economy, since immigrants could be more likely to be entrepreneurs and provide the necessary manpower.
Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
"Asyl exists for all who leave their home country because they are persecuted or out of fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to defuse all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people face every day worldwide.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"Everything is very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their soaked possessions and to recover everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the hospital staff damaged by the 7.5 - magnitude earthquake were completely overburdened.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the military hospital of Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the ongoing heavy aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went way too fast.
I think I was trapped under the collapsed walls," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cries for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place."
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with "propaganda advertisements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper filed a four-page ad in an American newspaper proclaiming the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused the state capital Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the US Congressional elections on November 6, a lawsuit that China denies.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the US elections are in line with the announcement by US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a rampant trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were supposed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, who exports large-scale agricultural products to China, announced that Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Register of Sunday, is now doubling this tyranny by posting propaganda advertisements in its own free press in the US.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the American tradition of freedom of expression and the independent press by turning paid advertising on the Des Moines register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will only find a limited number of votes against in the newsstands here in Beijing, and you will not see a real reflection of the differences of opinion that the Chinese might have about China's worrying economic development, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China’s best-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans scramble voters against the mid-term elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming interim elections, which could in particular result from women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already reported that they will continue with a vote.
"You can't undo such things," said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute move was sufficient for an FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the first advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the hallway of the Senate called "November is coming!", when the Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to hold on to Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public statement, in which her accusations of sexual assault against the candidate of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could result if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just about the body's vote, the final vote or the Kavanaughs review; it's also about the way the Republicans dealt with it and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to disagree on who they should believe on the basis of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying about his testimony, while 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford made an affidavit last week before the Senate Justice Committee that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during their school years in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup on the market with the aim of establishing competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee Open Source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can select where their data is stored and who gets access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We need to be active now," he said on the subject of startup.
"It is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow users to create their own personal online storage or POD.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the private and corporate sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide who can access which data alone.
The company describes this concept as personal reinforcement and data development.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the Company uses resources, processes, and capabilities to make Solid available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers will be able to create their own decentralized apps worldwide using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether a comprehensive change should be made, in which their entire business models will be completely redesigned overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In an article on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Viktoria Cross in World War I, was honoured
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I was honoured 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his involvement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Sunday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolism, since the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, through thick fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he advanced to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before rushing alone with a field weapon and shutting down three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on 4 October 1918; just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid down a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honoured to be able to participate in the parade and added that the bravery of a real hero would become visible above all through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were not surprised when Peppa Pig was suddenly on display.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to see the fight.
On Twitter, a fan described the change to the cartoon character as a kind of bad joke.
"Due to government regulations, this content is classified as non-juvenile, so it had to be changed to a children's show at 6 a.m." said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in Marketing and Communications at Bellator when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
Bellator's executive board, Scott Coker, announced that the company will work on the schedule to take UK viewers into account in the future.
"I think the problem could already be solved during the replay," he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday at the UK audience, and we won’t solve the incident until Sunday’s time, Monday’s local time there.
But we'll stick to it.
There was a lot of communication during the change. It was pretty messed up and it wasn't always all nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed that it was a technical fault.
Which was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise this won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to 5 instead of 6 matches, as usual, and we've been trying to give the fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is quite unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "uncomfortable" on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who took part in various Olympic games as a water jumper, says that he grew up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality. But that feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victories at the Olympic Games are no longer so important to him.
The real host of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses for several months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, he said that he used to regard himself as inferior compared to others, because the love for boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said: "Until now, the feeling of being inferior to others and different from the others is reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to not disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is now a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he spoke on this issue because fortunately he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The triple world champion fell in love with US film maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference had never been an issue.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and a teenager – he participated in the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley thinks that his entire view has changed since then.
Last year, he would have been all about gold medals.
But for him there are now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main prize.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London in 2012, as he wanted to be there at the very beginning.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in front of the local audience at the Olympic Games – that was madness," he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by it. He heard the song in the run-up to the Olympic Games and still caused goose bumps.

Mickelson, who is currently out of shape, is sitting on the replacement bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make every effort to make sure it doesn't turn out to be a debacle.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as is usually the case, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering on others and working on his game, hoping to resolve the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson has never been the most direct golfer and thus not an ideal cast for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the course itself wasn't discouraging enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, newcomer at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points lag behind in the 12 single games set a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence to Mickelson and could not add much to it either.
"He was perfectly aware of his role today, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is one of the world's well-known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it went and that's what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, had 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he's a great person who's popular with the whole team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little closer this week. It was fun to watch them.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can soon be over with the lead
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead, which leads into the last single games in the Ryder Cup, can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans, but only just crossed the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, winning a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
"The idea remains that we had a big head start in Valderrama, we had a big head start in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that's close," said Bjørn (pictured in the photo) after seeing the victory 5–3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all team members that it's not over.
It's gonna start real tomorrow.
Put yourself in the bag and do just the right thing.
The whole thing won't be over until the dots are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that is where our focus lies.
I've always said it, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're fully aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Bjorn continued: “I would never overtake the performance that his players have achieved on a difficult golf course.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual performances are in the foreground and this is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're being tested as a golfer to the limits of your skills.
You have to make that clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players score better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those big turns on the last day of the tournament. He stood on the winning side in Brookline before standing on the side of the losers after Europe's "miracles of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he replied to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to pull off the fast start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When momentum strikes in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We'll set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task to make up for the counter-attack, he has to compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
"I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything," says Bjorn about his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany’s New War Ship Delayed Again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War period. However, according to local media, it will not be delivered until next year at the earliest due to faulty systems and rapidly increasing costs.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that relied on a military spokesman.
The ship should have been put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are intended to replace the old frigates of the Bremen-Class.
They should include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and target marine missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays can lead to the state-of-the-art warships, which Germany is supposed to represent as a maritime power, being outdated at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The frigate F125, followed by the accident, hit the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware errors" that would have made the new ship unusable in a battle situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen-Class.
It was also known that the ship is far too heavy, leading to a loss of performance and preventing the Navy from carrying out upgrades in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany during the Second World War.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, became a problem.
Apparently, the cost rose to a staggering €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, defence officer of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the navy "is running out of operational ships".
Bartels said that the problem became bigger over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken away by the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape for food search.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track down dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown long-eared and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also perform mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and which species does what.
A map and a report of the habitat will then be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how these are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and to show how forest areas can be preserved for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flycatchers and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the subject of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Administrator David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
"Here in Threeave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there are many things we do not yet know about bats, so here and on other goods we carry out these works that will help us to learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He stressed the importance of first excluding the presence of bats before maintenance in the goods, since it was possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire population on site.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: "We still need to learn a lot about bats and in many of our species we don't know what their populations are like."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape accusations against him as "fake news" and said that people want to be "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The striker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her 375,000 dollars to buy her silence on the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video about his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "Fake News" only hours after their release.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: fake news," said the five-time winner of the balloon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," added the player smilingly.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the Spiegel for the accusations they described as "inadmissible reporting on suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded compensation for "moral damages of an amount equal to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was killed by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that they had sex, but say it was amicable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos of her injuries taken in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she "feared of retaliation" and was worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to break the deal, as she was still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer he switched to the Italian giant Juve in a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: The UK would ‘repent’ the loss of car manufacturers
The UK would "repent forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary of Economy Greg Clark.
He also said that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby should Britain leave the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis product lines, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that during an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March, we will see production stops at our plant," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a tough EU exit without an agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain in a tough Brexit.
Toyota's production facility is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock at the Derbyshire plant that would last longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa May's Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I said, allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he explained on BBC Radio 4's Today show.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite trade union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" while the dispute over the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has examined the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who investigated the election interferences by Russia, connections between Trump's advisors and Russia, and a possible judicial obstruction by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump as well as the resignation of the president using the 25th amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time, was announced for Thursday,
Trump said he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to prevent it from colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's spokesperson Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for it. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed for another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10th.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences did not imply an aversion to the TV reporters' "effect-happiness," but admitted: "I would not deny that they are doing effect-happiness."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President is doing more questions and answers than any president before him," she said, without any precise evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Press conferences will still be held, says Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, but much better than to speak to me.
We often try to do this, and you have seen that we have done this many times in the last few weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he made a bizarre appearance in front of a group of reporters.
Health Minister writes about Brexit concerns for EU workers of the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health addresses people from abroad who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and express the wish that they will remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to pay the cost of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland's decentralised public service.
In your letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the UK-EU exit negotiations continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the disturbing times this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, after a head injury which he contracted on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before being placed on a stretcher and removed for further testing.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details on the nature or extent of the injury" are known and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays for Tennessee State in his first season after moving over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, bringing his total to 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for buying real estate in the UK
Foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future. According to the new plans of the Conservative Party, the additional income will benefit homeless people.
This step is designed to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in stamp duty will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects additional income of up to £120 million per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamping fee if you buy real estate in the UK, with the extra income to benefit homeless people.
This step is an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn's success among young voters, who promises to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp duty is levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenue is to be channelled to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is levied in addition to the current stamp duty and including the increase to second homes and residential properties for rent introduced two years ago, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenue of up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London will be bought by non-UK investors, which will drive up prices and make it more difficult for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become 'spirit cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke out in favour of reducing the stamp tax in order to enable more young people to have their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping real estate prices up by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's "dwelling"."
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a spectacular series of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a fixed rent to a ban on eviction for no good reason.
He also wants to give city councils more powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream, according to which life should improve from generation to generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too far away for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness remains too great a problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that his ‘biggest goal’ is to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the club from the north-east of England, who is currently in third place in League One and who lacks three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish First League last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that's it," Ross told the show Sportsound from BBC Scotland.
“But when I was a child, I often saw Scotland playing in Hampden with my father, and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in club management."
Ross' predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic claimed not to be afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success will be measured by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and possibilities in this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he explained.
"It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only consider my time here as a success if I brought the club back there."
Ross has a three-year management career, after a phase as deputy manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month coaching career in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the margins of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before in his player career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"This was probably a real crossroads," he remembers when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, even more than games.
It sounds funny, because I didn't mess with myself, I could live from it and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I'm still doing this in terms of stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin in my whole life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30, so a study
The heat wave in the summer has given rise to the revenue from Britain’s crisis-ridden pubs, while restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 percent in July. However, according to statistics, revenue from restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the management consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, explained: “Sustainable sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, in which Pub’s sales increased by 2.8 percent. Restaurant, however, hit it even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on beverages showed by far the best performance, with an area-adjusted sales trend that increased higher than it decreased in restaurants.
Pubs focused on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the administered pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM leisure and catering analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies with a focus on food and it remains to be seen whether the more moderate temperatures in August will provide the much-needed respite."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that hides it from his parents
One study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 pupils in secondary schools found an increase in so-called 'fake insta' pages.
The message sparks fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main account" to show it to their parents
One out of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "fake insta" accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message sparks fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main account" that they could show to their parents but also own private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked others to "rape me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11-18 year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are being led into creating online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes "Voice of athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council at its annual general assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most distinguished athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from her extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election to the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meter distance at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, named four Olympic gold medals his own and today often appears as BBC expert, could not run after a passing blood circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell if or how far I'm going to recover.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers with cows causes excitement in the net
A manufacturer of milk pumps caused excitement in the network with an advertising clip in which breastfeeding mothers are compared with milking cows.
For the launch of the "world's first low-noise portable milk pump", consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has published a music video that is not very serious in order to emphasise the freedom that the pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lines like, "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a tail on me," or "if you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the internet.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say that it minimizes the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Just like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their young will be taken away from them within a few days of birth," said one comment.
The Elvie milk pump fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Remotely traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: 'Such a non-realistic advertising.'
Others defended the advertisement and a woman admitted that she found the song "urcomic".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breast-feeding.
When I pumped out, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: "This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discrete pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the recognition that many women using milk pumps claim to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and discreetly fits into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative market launch.
By comparing nursing mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the associated challenges, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and comprehensible way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump makes possible.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of interned migrant children is as high as ever, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, among other things because intensified rhetoric and measures of the Trump administration have made it more difficult to accommodate children with carers.
Traditionally, most caregivers were themselves illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become targets for expulsion themselves when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supervisors and other adult members of their households would have to leave their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office, announced to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous records in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either a supervisor themselves or a member of a supervisor’s household are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are delinquent foreigners.
That is why we will continue to follow these people," said Albence.
In order to be able to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules, which according to the staff of the accommodations in some children requires to appear in court within one month instead of 60 days after detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video and not personally to stand up for their legal status in front of an immigration judge.
In case of negative decisions, the person will be deported quickly.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to the accommodation staff, as well as reports from the system that they have been known in the last month to be anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are exacerbated by a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has problems are more easily overlooked due to their size.
They also explained that trauma, which many of the children are already suffering, could increase if they were taken to a tent town without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil with the pretext of fighting terrorism and were "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have been driven out of their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus "will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned up" by both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has stationed about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are engaged against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Concerning the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were in place, and he accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fears" that prevented refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to make it possible to return home," he said.
"They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid would be granted to Syria unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, was an opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad offensive of the Russian-backed Syrian forces to the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action would be taken against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front allied with Al-Qaeda, which will "be wiped out".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem mentioned the conditions of the Syrian government to participate in the committee and stated that its work should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, an impeachment or scandal prematurely end his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time'.
So far, there's no sign that the audience is tired of it.
Since 2014, the ratings at the best time at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the audience to 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with important news.
"It's like a fire that attracts people magically, because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series "Designated Survivor" on ABC TV about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘because he makes me laugh’ Scovell told me.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike everything on TV, the stories from Washington can determine the future of the fundamental decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible reunification of families and the health of the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen, when one becomes aware of having watched already six hours of an expert round, which discusses about Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manaforts 15,000 dollars expensive bomber jacket made of ostrich leather (according to Washington Post a "clothing rich in self-overestimation") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's rife description of Trump's, erm, anatomy.
I for my part will never be able to see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he does feels like a reality show he presents to you every night," says Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "The Three of the Pawn House", about Trump's rotating cast and daily turns on action (a fight with the football league NFL to break the fence, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise you won't come along.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crawled inside and looked MSNBC while simultaneously recording CNN.
He just couldn't get off the screen, not when Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people said 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Donations flood the tightest races for seats in the congress in the interim elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of electoral districts, which led to two incumbents competing for the same seat.
The newly-drawn suburban district in Pittsburgh is hosting the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the wake of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb competes against another incumbent, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The cards were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were violated by the Constitution and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a strike exchange of campaign funding between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th district of the state.
This seat was held for over a decade by a Republican and Trump won there with 20 percentage points advantage.
Political experts give the Democrats easy leadership.
The U.S. tested the punishment of El Salvador for its support for China, but then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
US Department of State officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all US foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesman for the ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador were sanctions considered, which in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in American aid, including for drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar gathering last year and represented a step forward in efforts to deter migrants from moving toward the US.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and effectively ended the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October to give a signal, according to diplomats, about the importance that the government is giving to the Assembly.
The three American diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh communications or punitive measures from Washington.
A government spokesman of John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to comment on the internal meetings on the condition of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learning from History
The next big surprise could be the report by special investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible judicial obstruction, for which there is now sufficient evidence in public.
Mueller is now also allegedly investigating whether Trump's campaign team has conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the majority of Congress were to change, Trump would face an organ that would make him accountable, at the very time he was riding by to step back in front of the voters; and possibly in front of a jury.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will influence how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Teufel's kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he proposed to secretly record the president and speculate on whether he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair or confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony in office?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will make Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, we will have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to ignite Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
As a result of a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear until the 2-2 tie against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for larger ones.
"This was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can make something out of it and we drove home with one point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked hard in the second half and were then the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this is going to be a tough game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we can do this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of retirement leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Life Insurance Division of Nationwide.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to care for you if you don't express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance this expenditure.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include traditional care insurance, hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Apply litigation at the last minute.
Set up a pre-emptive authority to instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and to ensure that health professionals comply with your wishes, if you are unable to express it yourself.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a familiar person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication intake or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only the financial questions play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the drug treatment?"
Who takes care of the dog?
Have you already finished this plan."
Man in Ilfracombe repeatedly shot with air gun
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shootings that occurred at about 02:30 British times as 'voluntary deed'.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the authorities, at least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
Because of the failed communication systems, auxiliary personnel were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a county in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi, which covers a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In 2017, an estimated 299,200 people lived in the district, an administrative unit below the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Civil Protection Agency, Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province Aceh in the north of Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December, which hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of which were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres high, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, which is popular among tourists, and caused more than 500 deaths, especially on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and former vice president's candidate, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and resistance to state violence, according to a report published by Alaskan police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from an acquaintance when they tried to call the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 bail has been collected.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked for his plea, he replied with "Not guilty, quite sure," according to the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three class A offences, which can be punished with up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B irregularity, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's lawsuits have been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she traced her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are interrupted and it is assumed that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the moment the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Attorney's Office Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terrorist Attack
The New York Attorney's Office demands the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the terrorist attack in New York City, which cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
Thirty-year-old Saipov is accused of using a hired pick-up from Home Depot for a terrorist attack in which he raced on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, driving pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight ofers "targeted" and inflicted "consciously" serious bodily injuries, as stated in the statement of intent for the death penalty claim filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigation court in Saipov filed a 22-point indictment, which included eight charges of murder in the context of organised crime, which were normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "fundamental planning and intent", according to the accusers, who described the way in which Saipov carried out the act as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added damage, pain and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was carried out in New York during a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who two years earlier was found guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, bore witness to a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court records.
He told investigators he was feeling good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do this after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were "of course disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of dismissal, will only prolong the trauma suffered by all parties involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party MP calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest campaign in the context of the Tories Conference.
The former party leader of Ukip stated that politicians "must feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be "already out" if Farage were Brexit ministers.
The challenge that May faces in the reconciliation of her deeply divided party has been exacerbated by the fact that members of your party who are in favour of staying in the EU took part in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping her Chequers compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Ally insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, she should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between their package and the Chaos.
Bone explained at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that Chequers belonged to the garbage.
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would be out already," he explained.
Wellingborough MP added: ‘I will stand up for Brexit, but Chequers is in the trash.’
Emphasizing his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.’
Bone rejected allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: ‘The idea that the British people had changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit supporter of conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told reporters: ‘I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unpopular in public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and in our activists who are actually walking through the streets and making sure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Minister will keep their jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage said in a speech that politicians must ‘feel the pressure’ if they are in the process of deceiving the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,’ says Farage.
‘They are trying to cheat Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘you won’t get away with it’.
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
‘We are mobilising the power of the people of this country, which has helped us to win the referendum and will never rest until we are an independent, self-managing, proud United Kingdom.’
At the same time Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners to the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ says Adonis.
‘This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “exactly test” presidential candidateship
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November elections, she would "examine the presidential candidate closely."
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about their future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently running for re-election to the Senate against the Republican Member of Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was vice-chairman of Trump's campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the center of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for women to "go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top."
Arrest after death shots on LSU player Sims
The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the event of fatal shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that they had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for assistance in identifying the man to be seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury on the head and died as a result of this injury," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to the sports media portal 247sports, on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the scene and possession of a gun and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship title after his team has given him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes Stallorder would play a major role in the race.
From pole position Bottas managed a good start and it was almost as if he was leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the box first and let Hamilton push into the traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits one lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre, in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside, with the risk of waiting for two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the back squares of the field and was seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for most of the race, as he stopped at his tyres to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the 44th round and did not manage to take a step in the remaining eight laps, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri has done an excellent job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me pass.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election campaign on Saturday, which insisted on not passing on to the press the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he accused the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement to the Senate's Justice Committee did not speak directly, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are "common, malicious and dishonest."
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and malicious and dishonest," the President said.
“When you look at the leaks and then you say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Released the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment, please.
No, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and it was published in early September. However, Feinstein denies that the Leak is from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for secrecy."
You Dementi didn’t seem to get along well with the president, who said at the election campaign on Saturday night: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defense of the judge candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, the Democrats claimed that the accusations would be used for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power with all means.
One sees the meanness, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt when they let themselves get under the wheels to gain power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants with a 5-3 win in the return match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early with two goals, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made the balance for the home team before Dwyer re-established the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard made his way for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was the third loss in the Elite League in the season for Adam Keefe's men who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the three previous games.
Dwyer’s opening gate took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a submission by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the template when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped to reach his equalization goal after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the half-time break, when he scored his second goal of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team was regrouped and Bouchard was again out with a power-play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen bring Dundee into the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half. Nielsen then secured his team the victory with a fifth goal after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Air traffic controller died after he made sure that hundreds of people in an airplane escaped the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he has died to have a plane with hundreds of people on board safely.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was going down.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this news," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may increase to several thousand. The country's Civil Protection Agency stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached," said the Spokesman of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters above sea level have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to do all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Since you're ready?" says CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, in which more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports a missing person after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that they cannot say anything about the whereabouts of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline claimed to work with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, but that they were in a stable state.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was flying beyond the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very shallow.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane through deep-heavy water.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working nearby to improve a landing site hurried to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people were killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the US Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her night of death.
Rowlett said to have received position data from various mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period in which he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford entered the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been to the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been to Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers at the time of her death for two weeks.
However, cell phone records pointed out that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis lost messages, calls and contact information from his cell phone some time after Chamber's death.
"He took them out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumed that the trial would then go before the jury on that day.

Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny suing couple for dismissal after "racist" SMS
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from the mother complaining that she was "still a black man".
The couple denied being racist and compared the dispute with a "extortion".
The two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new day mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEIN, ONE MORE WARZE," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending them to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After recognizing her fauxpas, the "worsely touched" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Maurice and claimed that the open-minded African-American mother of day had done a bad job and instead expected a Philippine woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and asserts a claim for compensation for the 350 dollars per day which they should have lasted over six months for which the job for which they had originally been booked, but without contract, and for which they would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," she told the newspaper on Friday, "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the accusations of racism and argued that the dismissal was the reasonable step, as they feared Maurice, after insulting them, could no longer trust.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the post office.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case with a "extortion" and stated that his wife expected a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“You want to charge such a person?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
As the lawsuit continues, the couple was quickly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it's very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's huge success today."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, would have had no problem with it, his work would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death last year was "bittersweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, which she described as a "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and didn't brag," Jankel said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who did something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given to her by the doctors to keep her heart pumping slowly stopped and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything was going down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went aboard the plane along with the other passengers, who did not get any of what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang up cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones by suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up maps on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and telephone numbers for counselling centres.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she explained.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room."
However, he quit his job before his death because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, "I always fear that this could have a consequence."
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been with for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behaviour.
On Christmas Day, he was on the low. When the children unpacked their presents, he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a big trauma for her, but that she had to go through it: “There is a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the air while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could actually get something like that about what he was asking, i.e. a time-limited investigation, then perhaps we could get a little agreement," said Flake on Saturday. He feared that the committee would "break apart" in the party-political stalemate.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an investigation from the FBI?
Their reluctance can be traced back to timing alone.
The interim elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans fail badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to decide on equal votes and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors sinking under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who relies on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that 1127 defectors were registered last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices for human smugglers as major factors.
Pyongyang did not publicly comment.
The vast majority of those who defected from the north are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953 over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China regards the defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks, which revolved around the halted denuclearization negotiations.
This was due to the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, at which they generally agreed to work towards a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Secretary of State Ri Yong-ho accused American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the US, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mir Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for the office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was in character unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't deny the impression that a woman who had acted like this would have been called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost screamed and was about to burst into tears when he talked about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him a "grotesque and coordinated murder of reputation" organized by liberals who were furious about Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was biased towards Democrats.
"I believe that he himself declared himself unfit with these statements and the manner in which he drew on the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office, should he be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judge position," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Appeals Court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade's abortion policy, since he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We don't need a hysterical, biased person to go to this court and expect us to say, 'Oh, it's not wonderful'," says Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of overheating anger, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She went on to say: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she was also crying when she got angry, but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she was talking to: “You may think that I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I cried because of an indescribable anger and was grabbed by an elderly woman, an undercooled manager, who I was always a little afraid of, grabbed by the collar and pulled into a stairwell.
"Never let her see you cry," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re pissed off.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with themselves, because they believe you have gone into the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship named Monkey Business during an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
"That was not a well thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation: ‘Snow-wit and the seven dwarfs’.
As the election campaign had already progressed, she was behind in raising funds, and she vowed not to run if she didn't get $2 million together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, supported her campaign with only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked herself.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and address voters directly instead of delegates, as well as the anger about sexism, so much so that she was close to tears.
"It could have been assumed that I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“It could have been believed that handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She wept"?"
Why Beijing Could Benefit from US-China Trade War
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a long-term trench between countries, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the American president, fired the first warning shot at the beginning of the year when he imposed punitive tariffs on important Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new fines on $200 billion worth of goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing struck back in the same way each time and recently imposed fines of five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China swore to answer any US measure and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon stumble.
Getting Washington to give in would mean giving in. However, a public cave in to the US would be far too shameful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized," says Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, said the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the over seven-year war.
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to allow normality to return.
All conditions were now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their everyday lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomed assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe succeeded in winning the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the US.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, sank his tee on the 16th track (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally, I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win the trophy back.
It's about the team and I'm glad to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won 2:1 in the single encounters against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday.
I'm so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I've been watching on TV since my childhood," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team had problems finding the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have done top-class performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hats off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players performed well.
We'll regroup, I'll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
