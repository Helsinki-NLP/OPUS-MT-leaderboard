The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a #PRS_ORG# major and so it's not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should add to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
I also think, in principle, that children should not be expected to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Give me a quick look, give me a little help, bring me the bottle, etc.
Thus they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be a child, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
It's best to see for yourself if that fits your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and go to sleep for hours.
Legally speaking, it's probably questionable.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement comes along.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquakes, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a thriller/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole story but I don't want the title partout to come up with maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by pouring food on him and going to his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, gets to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously to go and document the place of the suicide before each suicide and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where a chip is transplanted to the patient that suppresses a fear center in the brain and ultimately puts the patients in their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another goes to death with intention)
This face of fear is described in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there's a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is such a rough plot I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author/author.
If this story is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, dear, I don't have the password for the Wlan.
I need to contact my husband first.
That may take a while.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded ?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumb nail
Child, four years old, has over the entire length wood chip under the thumb nail (outside).
Trying to pull him with a tweezer.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we'll go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Due to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotives of track gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders are fully automated at a suitable digital control centre.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with suitable central panels.
For centrals that can program only the CVs of 1-255 exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable 16 functions to be triggered.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx®-compatible central systems.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the Märklin® brake tracks as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake components or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An automatic ABC commuter train enables automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog direct and alternating current paths.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccination
New Omikron cases are getting politics and science in the UK.
All qualifying adults in England are therefore to receive a vaccination offer by New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress in the Corona booster vaccinations than he has so far been aiming for, given the rapid rise in Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK Government would provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one is faced with an emergency, which is why the vaccination protection must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news was that the level of protection could be increased with a third dose of vaccination.
"Now, let's go booze!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm in favour of everyone introducing themselves to pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by e-mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but rather a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone help me, please?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to step over the feet of an official.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine using pronouns.
Got a total of five books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today won't work
Obviously, the chair had an undetectable lack of sales.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise ?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
==References====External links==
14 days no more.
So I always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about my soul.
I (21) is more likely to come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One issue that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims don't let themselves be helped or think we can't help them.
I am quite aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range, I can't reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of snatching the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this never makes it easier.
Please, always remember, you're worth living without violence, that's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the good news for "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking look: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debut of the MHP giant Ludwigsburg with the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick was dependable.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the trophy defeat at the beginning of October at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
After the match, however, it did not settle - but increased again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
But more than the naked result disappointed the way of the performance.
A statistic that expresses the whole dilemma is given as a proxy: The three-way rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) at 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we trained."
Namely moving the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "Winning a horny game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like it was 10 000 people."
Only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL-Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and steered the game of his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team, the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already been back 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to argue.
Already on Wednesday (19h) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
we used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I checked in a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have re-informed ourselves legally and have therefore written them again.
We originally called in half a year ago.
Always as if from the egg: Max Raabe gets 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't work.
The planned concert was moved to May 2022 - "on official instruction" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his performances planned during Advent must also be cancelled, as it is called on the website of the singer, who is now 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to make up for their appointments already published in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot as a teenager.
He studied operatic singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself in the style of the Comedian Harmonists with its repertoire of percussion and chansons.
He has received many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place on the charts - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair combed strictly back and etiquette-minded, Max Raabe is no longer to be imagined from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister for Building Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister for Building Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, no new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against a monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Green Party and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP in the traffic lights coalition about further tightening up in the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the extension of the rental mirror.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 dead by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled through the US.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
During the night of Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States have caused severe devastation and may have caused up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometre-long track of devastation, especially in the Kentucky state.
His governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everything was gone wherever the tornado ran through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, the official figures rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she's sold out display case #NAME#.
That's a shame.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely taken from the assortment?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
When will you get in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an artike or gave up a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if this arrived or is being processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government further rejects the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
Thus they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising slogans to inoculation calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to receive Corona vaccinations.
He changed to a company he blasphemed about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself in his old place and he was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'm doing a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to say hello!
For a group of 4 friends, I'm leading the adventure over the gripper pass and would like to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual files conceived and now I'm about to write the entry-level adventure and stumble on my own feet already at the first Encounter.
The premiere is that the heroes are supposed to bring a carriage with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of Goblins are supposed to ambush the hero.
I want to give the players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger at an early stage, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
If you don't notice, the Goblins ambush the hero in a hollow path, flanking three bows to the left and right arming the vehicle, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart's gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf with two of his servants intervenes and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to start the adventure?
The group Goblins will later play a decisive role, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I am guaranteed to heed many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I broke up the lamp again.
And put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send her back
If you can then let the returns come, then I can pack the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#.

Here was the lower part, so the part with storage space was damaged.
Is everything then picked up again or only the storage space part?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
First of all, the transmission was cancelled today in the middle of the F2 race in order to start F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the schedule was far behind schedule due to the delayed start and the start accident, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons the F1 takes precedence and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has finished the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in the F1 the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher were again unaware of the rules, so both didn't know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that tacks were allowed to change tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for buggers.
I think you should know such basic rules when commenting on the F1 on a pay-TV station.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally speaking, Roos does not like the artificial comment style, but admits that the taste is a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant silliness, both of which simply make them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (so unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter, in particular, brings a great deal of unrest into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over with Sky, in the exit round Sky is the only station that goes into the advertising, as one can listen at F1TV since only the German audio track without comment has to get along directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two stations do less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free TV station.
Although Glock and Baumgartner have to be praised for their work, this alone does not leave me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language channel to broadcast the F1.
Unifyingly, RTL does a better job in the four races, which they are still allowed to broadcast, except for advertising.
So anyway, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To this: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me it was going to be shipped on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she was going to check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the performance in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable, so that you can connect several outflows.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump it is also suitable to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find in our shop) or with a decor, which convert the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest to call mussel or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an austromer or similar...and it can start already.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher, as the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, place a check valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent once water would run backwards, the water running from the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, so is daily packed and the packages are also collected daily here.
Everything's going well on the way, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding sector...of course here no Corona stops.
Please do not judge equally badly just because the delivery is delayed, that is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to scold about these services, even if we say at the moment... they're having a hell of a hard time
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you order your legs here in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
On Saturday they were transported by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself received the newly appointed astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after the Blue Origin rocket system in 1961 as Nasa astronaut, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not share how much they paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would love to return to space, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers altitude
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometres above the earth, at times with zero gravity, before the reusable object, slowed down by large parachutes, landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts regard 100 kilometres above Earth as the border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-flight of Blue Origin: the first in July was Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
On October 2, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as Captain Kirk in "Star Trek", was also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing forward the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting in itself and also in the laboratory do not bother me (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also thought about career prospects before studying, but also at the time that I would like to study and become a doctoral student.
At the moment, however, I have doubts about my job prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear always super job opportunities and the job is totally wanted, on the other hand you hear again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really like to know:
1) As what are you working at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really unsure right now, and in 2022 I may be thinking about cancelling my studies and getting an apprenticeship as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have any experience there write them also gladly times :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why it's only now a post.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
It seems there are also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which is called "Assumption" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
A lot of e-mails, which had to get out before the driveway, order here order there, all *required* before the long weekend.
Because... because?
'Cause "next week then" sounds like so much time and that can't be?
Or because people really want to do as much in a shorter week as they do in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday then, but I was also very annoyed.
What's with this self-hungry about holidays?
Then why do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to treat ourselves properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independently so on.
My question is simple: are we just like this, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The nice thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree on the feast by baking cookies and making cookies with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But until the contemplative days she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of mouse and plumage formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of the plumage damage occurring in bird keeping is due exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage is made of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large proportion of animal losses occurring during moulting are due to a lack or imbalance in protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via the drinking water or via the soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
East German handcraft model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railwayer ME issue 11/1968, used with playing tracks and faulty parts see photos, function good, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal integral trains in the Silesian network, probably also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are operationally reworked
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive capable of transporting 2,200 tonne coal trains and 530 tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h cruising speed on this route.
The top speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery of the 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatz bearing drive AEG with the supply of the mechanical part, the Siemens Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The reprocessing of all six locomotives was established in the Reichsbahnerungswerk Dessau.
[4] With the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy goods train services, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reworked in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are available in larger quantities, were preferably built up.
It was only when the E 94 could be expected that the processing number could not be further increased that the E 95 became the focus of the processing.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the Halle P.
They were used in their own circulation plan mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of locomotives proved to be problematic with increasing age.
It often happened that shooters were stuck in switching operations.
Then the passenger on this locomotive had to release the shooter with hammer and wooden wedge during the journey.
Damages to the traction motors often occurred and led to months of breakdowns in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electric system was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could forego old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so that the E 95 were out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to occupy electric locomotives with one man, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the driver's cab.
[5] After the end of the E 95 02 and E 95 03 in mid-69, the E 95 01 were the last to follow them, who resigned on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle.
It took some time before the managers at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive began to be reworked externally with the aim of presenting it for a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Transport Museum Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The locomotive was completed in 1986.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive museum is maintained.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional association Bw Halle P have been working on the operational reprocessing of the locomotive.
In April 2015 the locomotive was presented for the first time for an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and outer paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching out secondary lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to Leipzig to become a central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary optical reworking on the locomotive in own work, dusted, with playing tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can have labels and storage marks.

However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet..unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?

House fire with two easily injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage occurred in the six-digit euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with light smoke poisoning on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume a deliberate fire.
Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But then it arrives much later

To defuse fake news - Biontech CEO publishes immunization photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech chief Uğur Şahin had not publicly expressed his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him to do so, Şahin informed.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how to get a vaccine against the coronavirus.
On social media, there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
"For a few months now, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me on which I am being vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has refused because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He's been fighting a severe Covid-19 disease and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote.
He had not asked for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and distrust."
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle circulates on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not allowed to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
There was a prioritisation in Germany of the vaccination of the Vakzins.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times according to the appropriate data.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases also probably no heating.
A fire had shut down a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to do without electricity for about 24 hours.
The fire caused the lights to shine on Friday evening with 41,000 affected inhabitants in several communities.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power units had been in operation until the large-scale malfunction could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
The THW's firefighters and helpers provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked the people concerned for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, Head of the Primary Technology Division, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, since the Westnetz-Monteurs were initially only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
According to information from Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday around 7.15 p.m. damaged parts of the 10,000 volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, elaborate cleaning and repair work was necessary.
Parallel to this, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back again.
Since Saturday 6 p.m. more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30 p.m.
Since 11.15 p.m., the last electricity affected by the failure would also have been electricity.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies had been in use.
The authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and report them to the local fire department stores if help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The main focus of the installation and operation of emergency power units was on the residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who have not been able to provide for themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy these from you and pay in euros?
It is the daily blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount this underframe on the tabletop.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push them together and thus shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I'd have to send her back, otherwise she's not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
Will you send me the return form by e-mail?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before chatting.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
You want me to do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic combination: Combination Riiber wins

When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made it new and use version 4.5...
could be that they have heard of problems more often
Having bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
Sobal I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.

As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?

I have to work in between!
In order for the paint application to become even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse off with clear water and dry off.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
A slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid wiping back and forth quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealistic-looking areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could go through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they mix with normal colours.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
The models achieve a true look through the decals or decals.
From emblems on airplanes to ship names to trims and plates on car models: the Decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the right order as long as the components are still easy to reach.
An airplane cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are when pasting time, patience and a calm hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay it out for you.
Decals are also called water slide pictures, because you moisten their back briefly with water until the backing paper gets dark through the wetness.
Then you only push the picture a small piece of paper and place the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you also moistened before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper off sideways.
Attention: Always check whether the picture is right before you push it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to the finger, creases or even tears.
Extract excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place until where I have read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
ok thanks anyway!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But can I get that back without a problem?
Child wish treatment with PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello, everyone.
we spent some time in children's wish treatment, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, this suddenly turns across.
One by one:
We had applied to the PKV for the children's training in advance and received the confirmation of 3 tests.
The experiments were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and performed 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet calculate them with the PKV.
We applied again for the cost of the PKV and received again 3 further attempts.
After some further tests (we have performed more tests than we have promised, the most expensive ones are calculated logically with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth the other 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second wish for children was a new insurance case.
According to the General Terms and Conditions, however, "the insurance case begins with the healing treatment, it ends when there is no longer any need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Would the PKV have had to point out to us in the pledges that the further attempts will be made with one birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to get them again best
All right.
We won't order anything from them anymore.
When they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customer.
They are welcome to forward this to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague said to me that the repayment was arranged and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't help it that the dresser gets to me completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
It's clear that the repayment was initiated and I still haven't received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, I can't get another kind of packaging.
I will be able to remove the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget movies
What a low budget film is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net, you can find plenty of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What's bothering you?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
Wanted to get the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
Sincerely,
If there is no phone number, a chat, where you have to wait 30min, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll give up again soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong said to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU had not solved the confrontation sustainably, said the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of stability - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels that it is a winner - is likely to go on for a while.
Mr Bossong said that dealing with people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
There seems to be an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It does not seem to be able to prevail if a Member State puts itself in the head of doing its thing", as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU would pay a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, Bossong said: a fundamental agreement on asylum policy would be made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" had been strengthened.
Renewed attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again tried to reach Poland via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested the night after Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokesman for the agency on Sunday.
The Polish officials were thrown with stones by the migrants in the incident near Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
A total of 52 attempted border crossings were registered within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as a leader in Minsk of attracting them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of EU response is pressure on airlines, said Bossong.
"Since the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two breakages during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula One finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The Silver Arrows assume two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have passed irregularly.
A second objection was filed against the classification at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had raced to his first Formula One title.
The manoeuvres took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars driving ahead of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you again.
thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organizes SC-Fribourg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, named after the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited guests to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park informs, members and season ticket holders of the sport club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coasters lit red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," says the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the cooperation between the Bundesliga and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has been in place.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it was shown again how well the partnership fits.
Seeing brilliant fans who have fun together in the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
yesterday I gave up the contact form for returning an article, but did not receive an email confirmation or the like.
My question would be whether my request was received.
It does not everyone have the time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake you fix and not all of our household.
Contact Mrs #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
Yesterday we had chatted and agreed that I or Mrs #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a back label.
This e-mail hasn't come yet.
The package would like to take you to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
Sincerely,
The LokSound 5 decoder can play up to 10 channels simultaneously.
Each channel can be resolved with up to 16 bits / 31250 kHz and finally offers HiFi quality on your system.
There is virtually no difference to the original audible anymore.
A Class-D audio amplifier with up to 3W output power controls the speakers, which may have impedance between 4 Ohm and 32 Ohm.
The huge 128 Mbit sound memory provides enough capacity.
All individual noises can be individually adjusted in the volume.
The superflexible sound engine without a rigid schedule allows the simulation of all conceivable rail vehicles.
Three separately adjustable brake functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicles.
Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semitic means nothing.
It's like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both of them won't admit their i.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it completely.
Yeah, wow, then you're just as little serious as Kollegah.
Who seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god started the whole thing.
But as soon as you're creative, you have to believe that Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just fooling around.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to take any further seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass up to the edge zone without any drawings and colour defects.
Magnifying magnifiers are often marked with magnification information.
However, these data only apply to precisely defined conditions which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections arise on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - also with impact magnifiers.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimal conditions of use - magnifying glass close to the eye - are observed, reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curious situation when selling firs.
One day, even without his partner, a man is said to have returned home because they could not agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas period a little fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And so they both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "turner", which by far doesn't sound so delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a couple of weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Before that I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbit without fail except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbits to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, they also arrive.
However, the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (­45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar large losses.
Could someone explain to me why fiber optic "lost" so much Internet speed over the power line?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to change the current account
Who would have thought, now would be calm with the current accounts, sees himself mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to let themselves be confirmed again with all sorts of tricks by their customers the fee increases of the past, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to decrease.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she halved the allowance and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25.000 euros for day-to-day cash accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a speaker on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, just as it did at ING Deutschland.
The DKB direct bank, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Verivox Internet portal.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have even got right in the first instance before the regional court of Berlin against this regulation.
It is already being discussed in the banks whether institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the upper authorities also declare negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and that many millions of bank customers must be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She's officially at the top of Hollywood now.
But her life is like a descent.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made a sensation in 2021 with the "Friends" reunification and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and coaches takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, they treat themselves to a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans fly to her at the same time is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with luck - and she's still looking for great love.
And canceled the baby wish from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurting.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped his sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight gang contact, Räikkönen had to turn off his Alfa Romeo at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi after less than half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finished his career in the motorsport class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 Ferrari World Championship.
He made 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the Pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins the 60th World Cup - Nolte wins the 2nd World Cup - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I calculated that I would have to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina in 2026," said the double Olympic champion of the BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
Only on Saturday did he prevent the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from third place to one.
Then he changed something about the material setting and drove out a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed in front of the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone at greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also made his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came to fifth after second place this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it like that," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won the third win of the season in Zweierbob on her home track.
After finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced for the World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with Anschieberin Deborah Levi.
Two-erbob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she won the first podium this winter.
The Wiesbaden-based Kim Kalicki ended up in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium spot in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, stressing: "It's not just a push, but there's also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka got a little angry about the not completely error-free rides, but said: "It goes in the right direction".
I already had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked for it.
By means of Corona, I had quite different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it's said he's expired, which really upsets me.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order again because it is reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken away yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivery.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the entire order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe it's one of them or others like that...
I'm 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mama - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or goes to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, has taken a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because hand is in the bandage wg combustion).
On top of that, it's cooled and we're seeing less (1-2x week) now, which is very hard for me with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child has a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is also housework to us, which we of course divide.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is very well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and manage.
Not good, but I can handle it and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is asking a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I have not yet done anything and the day after tomorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare a little something.
And next week I'll have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what's next is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room.
So my week goes like this: only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on?
Just until your birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holiday.
Just till the weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'll pack that ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but that's the only way I can do it...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think that's also partly related to mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd find some kind of sufferer here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, I'll get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on December 26th #NUMBER#.
Two times, anyway.
But she wasn't confirmed.
Something completely different: I found out back in school that many religious teachers did not believe in God and it was just another subject for them, like math or geography.
For me it was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised in a Christian way and so I always believed somehow.
What do you think of that?
You may also be able to tell about workmates and fellow students with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would just be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity.
What brings you to want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Keeping culture or something?
Hope you're asking isn't too private.
Can't it be changed or not?I like to write in English that I understand well
It's been a long time, then I wouldn't mind.
All right, thanks.
I expect prompt feedback by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film Search Help Please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (bin 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernism (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself.
I believe the passage is also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers fight against each other.
If that tells you anything, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little girl just slept on her stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything is right around it, no cuddly animals, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's what drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ahso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your kid when he's asleep.
Is it turning your head aside?
Can it straighten up from the belly?
Or is it with the face ahead Directly in the mattress?
That's what you can tell if everything's all right.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband was born, it was, for example, gang and that you put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But why do you offer me only EUR 20?
Hello, I wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used at the moment.
To be quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV, too.
But it's just that the politics of this station are now under control.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one is an "independent" Internet station.
Quote Arno: One wants to "not be a running column".
What do you do now?
A 0815 commercial, trying to get his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They may of course continue to offend people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How are you supposed to like all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I ask for a call back because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or just to cuddle – My little warmth friend is versatile.
Cherry core pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and dispensed again.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion with a cover is suitable as a heat pad only for the following application areas:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical smell, stick or burn spots and dispose immediately in case of presence.
Please remove the inner cushion to warm up beforehand from the cover!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer!)
Directly after heating spread the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then return the inner cushion to the cover.
At the first warming, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but it disappears in repeated applications.
Be sure to adhere to the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can lead to damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is permitted in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for fitness for babies (max. 43 °C) at your arm bend!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory problems, fresh haematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as in persons with reduced pain.
In the case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour diseases as well as pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If seams are opened and loose cores are released, discard the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country where the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after series second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 works from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt it does not run under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough for operation.
Error, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged in power supply.
As a result, I removed the battery, but nothing is happening here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains mode?
Is there something else that's broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stowed with the padded FlexFold parts.
And what else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2) the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing easy access to photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
There is a metal hook with matching anchor bars at the front of the backpack in the flap.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "filling levels": there are 4 anchor bars, stable riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it is rather empty, a lower one.
In addition, flap closure and hooks are magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to dig through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday fitness of the backpack enormously: If you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more about it below) and thus store both of them separately without any problems - and access it independently through the two lateral openings.
You can also pull the backpack in front of the body from the right side, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday things remain safe in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday from confirmation for the assignment of
Contact from the forwarding company to pick up the wrongly delivered table announced.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking for immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support staff, with no one I could go further than to the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
It can be seen when the cabinet could be returned?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help

Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that the past year went differently than I thought I couldn't guess and just couldn't redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept it.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically worked (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific for certain discs and samples.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which depends on the characteristics of the original assembly with the balancing of the disc.
The tuned discs manufactured in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, whereby the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake blocks.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned discs underline the character of each car by attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread rapidly and triggered the so-called 'California Gold Rush' from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were staked, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many people it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll be looking for gold, recruiting workers, gathering horses, and building businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You will simultaneously choose your actions, budget with your resources, and build a tableau that will "work" more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style using fine adjustments.
Coloma plays for a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), from 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Players then take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The prizewinner turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This continues until the prize winner has moved five times, thus covering each location once and ending the year.
There is a shooting in which the players have to defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score.
The player with the most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation showed up in my Twitter timeline today, and I was looking at it right away.
>The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008) he triggered a fierce educational debate.
Former patient: now serious accusations are being made against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and others in charge must never, never, never! for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is meaningful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, it's still shaking me.

The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the test obligation for triple immunities.
"We countries need quick clarification as to whether and when the test obligation can be eliminated for three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, the "Picture on Sunday".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinations is "not only medically useful, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal for this to the Health Ministers Conference next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to do that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more shopping through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I've updated account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe is referred to as "awareness", i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing sounds/voices, less often to seeing pictures and most rarely to seeing pain.
Relevant for this topic: C-sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anaesthesia is avoided for the protection of the child until abnabelung.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during anaesthesia preliminary discussion.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the €20 won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money.
I've already sent you an e-mail that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is the company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Aren't I being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97-year-old
He has distinguished himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later he wrote a monumental theater story.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The staggering diarium of a slow farewell to the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle conducted until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I already testify here my thanks for life".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are europallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are used primarily in the European area as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to statistics from Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The value of production was just over 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected
New York wins MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.

In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had many great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'll set up a cattle fund for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's the next step?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I can handle it.
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBERS#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today, the money has not been received by me.
Would you check there, please?
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Time's running out.
We'll tell you where you'll get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust the desired level and the breaking content of your sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything at the "gain" and the distortion.
Further up, it already sounded that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even make a power reserve flutter when it comes to loudness.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controls, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be exploited in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as line output.
This signal is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an impressive "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphones or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot button, you can also conveniently call up the sounds by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "take" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking a further step into the future!
But that's how others saw it.
Is it possible to send the lamp back to you?
Since it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive an update to the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If I can't, I'd be happy with a discount or a voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need are a little bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worthwhile
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
Iran has indicated that progress has been made in the negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday, Irna News Agency.
This was a "positive and important development", because at first there had not even been agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on revitalising the agreement were continued after almost a week's interruption.
The negotiations will involve negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia is the only federal state to have been located above the 1000 mark at the Corona Incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths associated with an infection were reported within one day.
200 patients with severe covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays can occur on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overburdened for weeks and are hardly lagging behind with the registration of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this and stick it on the package and hand it over to the post office, that's it, right?
here I don't have to click/specify/fill anything else?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, so I'm writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my eyes an insolence.
It's time for change
###MFederal Day greets me, I am u/StratorDE in the Chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the mail here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not extant.
We have come into a winter rigidity and have extended the summer hole to a few months.
#What's the problem?
Yeah, what was it all about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to discontent, as some things have gone down here and as we generally stand.
In the last few days, the impression has become more and more that many here are really still looking forward to the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and found, simply put, a pile of pieces of shards.
After writing a few things back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to urge everyone to participate once again, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed / adapted / removed?
* How are we supposed to appear outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a lot, but that's not bad, so we end up with the Discord.
If you have time and desire, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clumsy for it and not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the daily blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I'm asking you to move that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long would I have to get them or choose to return them?
How do you answer the question why you're vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself used to live vegetarianally for a while, and at present she probably rarely eats meat.
I myself was also a vegetarian a few years ago.
When asked if I always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that is that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that in the end I also support animal torture.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was displeasure on her side, that she then defended vegetarianism and that she knew where her flesh came from and that as a vegetarian, animal suffering was reduced.
Now I wonder if my answer to 'plump' was?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that you as a vegan are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without you putting it on it.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Do not release your #PRS_ORG# from the legal requirements for distance sales.
I am on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# does not collect my returns on site.
Since I can't be there because of a funeral, it can't be changed.
Can I have an alternative pick-up date, please?
From the 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly to be found again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a donation of 45,000 euros to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein City Hall for the new water rescue vehicle from the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this regard," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the diver squadron Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a steady increase in operations: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel and the continued increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book which I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, have synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and I'm hoping for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

Thank you for coming up with the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, that is, we were also arms carriers in the executive, and I would not like to go into that further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that of course the public servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, it is also clear that in the special uniform and weapon bearer people on the right should be magically attracted by conservative people, that these people can then of course hardly deal with the lived reality, because of course you have of course beside the average white, meanwhile many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the exaggerated feminine cliché gays, because these exist in the executive rather less to not at all but quite normal men and women to whom you don't notice if they don't tell you) and also on these people can and must I rely, because in doubt they save your life or put this for you.
But even if it sounds strange in my experience, these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly works for them or thinks it must do them right, in doing so they simply want to be treated as normal.
Back to the right, because of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will find extreme rights there, but that they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge some state-threatening plans is mediaally exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that especially policemen and soldiers who were often in foreign assignments often start to flatrate due to negative experiences and also sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that sometimes even right-wing fellows of mind meet to conduct a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, I believe that this is being well fought and countered by political education and education!
Germany is so intertwined internationally and this is also good so in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, which I do not understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
it was confirmed to me but so in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is available somewhere in Germany.
I only find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy with one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but for the rest of my life I get it more bad than right to run my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything stops, and then and when it grabs me and I clean up and clean.
But it is never really "that someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better either, it disturbs me somewhere but mostly loses household simply against work and ill-will.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get better with child?
We don't have one yet but work on it and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just does not bother me so much, as long as no visit and e.g. always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preform with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knee bends)

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have completed a training in software development and have now been trained for about a year.
Unfortunately, however, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means roughly that I don't have a sense of self-esteem and I'm shy accordingly.
I have no problem talking to people on an objective level, but it is very difficult for me to have relaxed conversations and I have been told more often that I am acting unapproachable (which I think has already become better).
Can I be a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or at an open youth meeting place, but rather in addiction counselling or family help, for example.
But I don't know if the actual day-to-day work is really the way I imagine it is, and it's hard to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("it's already the easiest things to mess up again") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do it myself"/"I keep him away from work with my stupid questions"/"he must really consider me as inferior" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to have mentioned it at the point.
But you've already got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation.
I'm waiting for an appointment to pick up
What do you mean, give back, please?
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) taken up with the food dissects the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds out of these in turn its own protein substances, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The formation of plumage in the nesting and the formation of plumage in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and for the overall organism of the animal a particularly high stress is associated.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be returned.

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A coated measuring spoon (inset) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe plumage damage, the double or triple dose NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of plumage formation is visible.
The normal dose is then given until the new plumage formation is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months ?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Have you received this e-mail?
Statement of a municipal employee in the contradiction to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have this problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So, you filed a case application for the municipality.
A co-worker tells me that the fall of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use them new packaging for it.
I didn't get a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, that's what I think, but the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that out?
Breaking news: Severe road accident at Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord and Plößberg junctions.
According to the police press alarm at the moment (14:03 o'clock), a car has come into the back traffic while overtaking.
There's been injuries.
Oh, okay, I get it.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas on further working life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is just thinking about everything that can be dismembered.
Before I get here now .. in short: I need advice and best of people who somehow know my situation - so of you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-beginner.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in one area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't call anything more specific).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up at the teacher's office and was sure that it was - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job advertisements".
And it's only been half a year.
At the times before, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Now it's a vacation, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was my weekend and my end of the day.
That's when I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now even the family party is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that bother me in addition.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it shuts down completely - if it doesn't already.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, took free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but was properly paid for it and worked together in a team and not as a single fighter like this most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year's time I didn't get back to the same place as now and I'm dissatisfied.
You realize it's all kind of messy, but maybe as an outsider you have advice or ideas about how I get out of this situation, which I'm completely finished and almost start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions that emotionally right now, which probably doesn't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, that's enough for now.
Thanks for reading, and I apologize for the whining tone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has been constantly evolving, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the Valve Reactor circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply achieve the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only spring.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is primarily thanks to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to meet new sound requirements, which led to a further boost in the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists are looking for a maximum variety of sound.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of game dynamics and string stops as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that especially the power amplifier determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The defeat series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro fasteners, it is tailored to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack naturally depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible placement would be a DSLR camera with a set lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a plug-in flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for things that are not photogenic.
Drones pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists dared not predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV station RTVE.
Millions of damage
In the almost three months since the start of the eruption, the lava, which is more than 1000 degrees hot, has destroyed almost 2900 houses and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Before the coast, two new promontories with a total size of about 50 hectares were created by cold lava.
It was mainly the banana cultivation, which was immensely important for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will not be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colourful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive in themselves, connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giftgiving, so that the gesture of giftgiving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss had been a peace-building "social contract of natural peoples", could escape the rigid routine and be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked with the giving.
Before that, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. Nicholas' Day.
The background to this custom, which is still popular today, is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold in her window in one night to spare her another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the custom, popular in Germany, was to fill the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants met with this custom because they reject mediators between God and men as "Holy Worship".
For these reasons, they are hiding against the institution.
Martin Luther made Santa Claus the Christkind and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift was shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions as closely, it is only the least that annoys that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period, similar to the Martin custom with Martinssingen and Martinsumzug.
Today, in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches, you will find everything your heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian lands
Sources testify to a tradition of giftgiving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a joyful cuddling about the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region, whether the Christmas Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Santa Claus, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white noise level, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh drawn by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some fame.
It's not reindeer here, it's three horses pulling his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's shop.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots had been fired and the man had been hit.
He was declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is simply positioned and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground skewers.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Light duration max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic version can be used all year round outdoors.
In the Hollywood Spectacle, these are mostly menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow in colour inside.
Quite harmless, however, is »Smart Stone«: The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – either in white or coloured light (in equal six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the neighbourhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself big preparatory work: As a solar lamp »Smart Stone« requires neither supply nor batteries.
Place the »lightstone« in any place illuminated by the sun during the day.
Two supplied ground skewers provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides »Smart Stone« inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dawn, »Smart Stone« begins to glow automatically; in what color, you decide for yourself: Six attractive light colours are your choice – next to daylight white.
Also the switch off takes place automatically, as soon as the battery charge level has fallen to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins the next day.
I've done it several times before. It doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started to take the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and fucking PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this again, because I already have to take enough drugs because of chronic illnesses, which I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly, not the pain, but my skin.
At my last two-year break, I had gotten explosive pimples from 0 to 100 and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but I was very burdened and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without drinks, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, gynaecologist didn't take me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the sweet skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertary severe neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodule lichens and the acne theme.
I also tried everything possible in the course of my illness and got stuck on a sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food, because nothing else worked really well.
It can also be good that Hormonell is simply the worm in it, but if you like me everywhere construction site want you just don't want to go looking for more what else is going wrong.
I already had everything for her colleague Semina o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I have to work in between and on the phone, and all of a sudden everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but it generally exists in large

110 kV earth cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high voltage cable at Tann is final.
The plan approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for the construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This is what the network operator Bayernwerk has now announced.
The approximately seven-kilometre long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning.
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.

All three other packages have arrived so that delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget that, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a chest of drawers made of glass and the entire sides are broken, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come to the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
That means the dresser can't be picked up because no one's allowed in my apartment
Thanks for the message
but why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, so yes the request at #PRS_ORG#, because it is probably a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in the Ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I still have great problems planning my teaching in the field of geography in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not at all well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for Earthwitness).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the subject of geofactors and I actually have every hour to ourselves.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to spend too much time on simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd really like that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBERS#.
I have actually decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to make the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears about the 2G scheme for Christmas business.
Only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed to enter most shops.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of a decline in sales.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for the retail trade.
When dealing with articles of non-daily demand, sales had to be lamented, HDE Chief Executive Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a recent survey conducted by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative view of the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without ground," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost a third of their pre-crisis numbers in the past week.
It only works well in the food retail and online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
"2G while shopping doesn't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The band regulation had to be allowed nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and had access to all shops with the received ribbon on that day.
In addition, sampling checks should be sufficient in the retail sector, as in the case of public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Deutsche Euroshop, a real estate company specializing in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the sales at approximately 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of such important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Business Week".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the Centers are trying to find solutions and get approval.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, can provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and afterwards - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error, which was tried with a yellow filler to be covered.
This looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in TV studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, one of the memory keys is simply pressed longer and finished.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that with new switching on the known situation is again - Very convenient for studio work if e.g. the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester also included - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right one on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with electricity via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment as a connection, so you can directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination is to be reliably adjusted by means of locking devices on both sides.
Care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
Great is that a bag is included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might still want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after scoreback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes the last two in series victoryless Hessen were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour the frustration about a grown-up season start from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys did today", cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke out a "spauschal-Lob, to every single one who was there".
At the beginning, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurter, which is now in ninth position, was still below their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkuseners with 2-0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," continues Glasner.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defense player Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the spot again for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the audience.
That was the party we were going to throw today.
But Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also sees itself well positioned with regard to the personal situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now one wants to "continue step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the turn of the year "at this level".
Next on Wednesday in the course of the English week there will be an away match with Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 o'clock, Sky).
I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and had it rerouted, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and place the order again?
Would for me then unfortunately mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women before quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's handball women crept from the parquet after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty looks.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB-selection won a bitter defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers at 16:32 (8:13) and has to fight against host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent," said Federal coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game for everyone, and we have to delete it," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the World Cup second of 2019 next Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," admits Xenia Smits, "we have to look forward quickly now."
From front to rear not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on the level with the whistle.
Faults and technical faults in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 residue after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterstroke.
However, this was not the expected initial ignition.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes the German women could hardly put themselves in the limelight - and if they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game had run early in the 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backspace player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and reach at least five goals until the break.
The anyway only quiet hope for a catch-up after the change was already after seven minutes at 9:19 away.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to pick up a performance increase and left the stage as a clear loser.

The title is given, I am working as an immunization doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated especially in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to a large extent finished, it then goes on to some extent in vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not related to one personally (e.g. "I take drug X, this is compatible with the vaccination..").
In my area of responsibility is the information for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to Coronaimpfveordnung and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and if necessary the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I never happened).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, who cannot carry out any vaccinations (may?), so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialectic word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" has provided a lot of thought.
But unlike many previous days, the term remained un guessed by the callers in the series "Host mi?" this time.
No, it wasn't a "human being nervous."
And no one "who needs to go fast."
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
To which the man from Amberg shared the solution and thus probably also caused many Upper Palatinates to wonder.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialectologist Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more known dialect word "Houdern".
Which closed an educational gap - probably also with some who have long lived in the Amberg area.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
The following error message always occurs after confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I started the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, rebooted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tire selection on the road bike- really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I drove off with my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in so every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) lurks.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire did not want to join the rest of the track at all.
Since I had no real way to get a replacement coat and a replacement hose due to the weekday, I had to turn around again with a bad mood and take the first train home.
Was then also moody not quite so bad, maybe it is also better, if I practice again before the bike tour with the tyre change.
But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike until 2 pm 120km torn off!) and who had already described this as suboptimal, because he drove with them for several years on roll.
But if I think that I still have to make a tyre change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I have come into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me wondering why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; these should be unplattbar.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so imputable?
I don't want to spend 40€/tyres now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I think I have 25x622 on the road bike right now.
There are also (apparently?) the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on other tyres on a road bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Lay knowledge rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and greetings!
Car hurls against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had hit a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car from an unexplained cause and then got onto the opposite runway, as the police reported.
There it came to a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then hurled against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.
yes we have deleted all books all new and loaded new books

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also get its offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and visually reminds of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal a suitable designed foot is directly included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
As a matter of principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but in terms of sound, an exceptionally high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate almost unfiltered such large sound pressure levels.
This does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal the SOLO 15 was matched with a slight high-pitch rise.
This is common in widebands in order to optimize the too high frequencies strongly increasing bundling.
The SOLO 15 is precisely aligned to the listening area and convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
The tweeter range can be reduced slightly to the outside and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a fine dynamic that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution capacity and battery.
As with all our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the loudspeaker in order to plan appropriate changes in the construction.
If, for example, one wants to veneer the housings, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer applies again material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole into the bottom plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the speaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
On the back side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chassis to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four bolting points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail Fase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are glued.
The three stiffenings should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, if, for example, you want to use finished strips from the DIY market instead of producing them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a Forstner drill the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall is facilitated.
Then you use a rotary cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded off.
Afterwards, the base plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucking / blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
Push the entire and unshortened cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, the cable leads to the speaker opening and lets it hang out loosely.
Below, the crossover is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document:
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the seal follows the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and thus close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now the attenuation follows according to the description.
Then connect the B 100 - 6 OHM and screw it with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus cable (marked cable) must be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> Finally, we can announce that we are again organising the OSCAST this year!
> For known reasons, we are unfortunately not able to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people by switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Get some drinks cold, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
