28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother testified that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "Finally, he was uphill again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, reported to the forensics department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, had earned his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said that they were "shocked and devastated" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our condolences are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "the things for him finally went uphill."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this unpolished diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's telephone number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
In an interview, the Hollywood star has now made this unequivocally clear.
"I am always stuck in drawers or I get labels glued on from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not want to always be perfect and successful."
"To tell you the truth, I don't give a shit about these things."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with loose dutt and Mexican food, according to the magazine.
"We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's play" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be in our house from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a change with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their retirement, chasing home to the feed troughs in a fast gallop.
One kilometer at this pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again near horses.
He let himself be led with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he swung not even for photo purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German Sports Aid presented the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports Pyramid at a small gala.
The likeable athlete does not lack awards.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver laurel leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting successes, but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the double US champion was admitted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
Among the winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them rather small in doubt and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, Trump claims.
He said he was going to massively reduce regulation, and he was pushing for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, that it has opportunities for disadvantaged people and that it needs money.
That's why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton almost say that they need to invest in them.
The democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the Republicans' state-critical Teaparty wing, for example.
So Trump could still have internal party discussions ahead of him.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart coal production in the US.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, and he wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energy through its investment program and demands: "One country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, they do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they simply want to protect American jobs better.
They are then to be paid better, for example, Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to 15 dollars an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum wage must be up, then he says it must not be changed.
But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics argue that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, there is Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every escaped woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby with them, who is at most one year old.
One of them put her little son in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the managing director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
In the north of Munich, they live in one of the few decentralised shelters for single-handed women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was officially opened recently.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a security guard outside the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a source of hope," she says.
For women, other reasons prevail: "Many steal from it secretly because they see no other way out".
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honor killings, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what drives them away.
On the run, it goes on.
"The fact that tugs demand sexual action for a bottle of water, for example, is not uncommon," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that this end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is insane, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly did not arise voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they dare not speak openly about what has been experienced, because shame is too great."
Since they often don't know how to help each other, more accommodation is only needed for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their area of competence, some answered no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swabia, refugees alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press officer of the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children in some community accommodations.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If there is privacy or if men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can occur - on an ongoing basis".
Especially the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, says the study.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be seen by the crowd that exists on the house in Munich.
"Since we've been talking about our existence, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Residents strike: demands for new industrial action
Representatives of the interns have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their disputes concerning a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire Council to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns about the treaty.
Residents and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "persistently calm" to problems, resulting in the contract being rejected.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and request official renegotiations for all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action starting in early September.
The disputes led to residents striking six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA intern Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 interns and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors would be forcibly introduced in England.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed slim-lipped and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "lovely friend" Putin - according to a report five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But a lasting coolness radiating from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the launch of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was shaky.
Putin split out and accused Ankara of having fallen in the back of Russia.
The offense was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unreserved attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were guilty of everything.
Most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to make a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after being almost relieved of his duties in a failed coup d'état last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights resume.
They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there, tomatoes this way."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
In addition, there is the continuing grudge over the snail speed of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state institutions after the attempted coup d'état.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself is deeply afraid of regime changes.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described to me, an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel rejected and ill-treated by the West and now unite.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that, after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even touched the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about her differences, while Putin decided to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
According to the Bank’s Chief Executive Officer, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for retail business that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop into a bank of brands, because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th profit at Newmarket on Prediction
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He relied on Predilection, which is coached by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He succeeds Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori picks up the cheers when he gets the victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernism and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has been inspiring fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey, he would have already won 6,000 wins!
Frankie has been riding winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had trouble returning from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he's far from finished - Dettori used to say that he wants to continue in competitions until he's at least 50 years old.
Russia’s Putin Fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a statement by the Kremlin, Putin stated that without giving reasons, "the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration had been ordered."
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin website (in Russian) says that he later became the chief of protocol and chief of staff of government personnel.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once hailed as a potential president suddenly wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - arduous post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted the most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term as a third term of office would have violated Putin's constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced their termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a message.
Details of how Gibson's character is written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to the comments of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been part of the series since the first season of 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart's blood into it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a news release published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that won't be possible anymore.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a show.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28th.
Puzzles of fish that landed in garden in Banff
A Banff resident called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sand eels that were spied out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £ 1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four locks of the "deck blower" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 cable ropes.
The £ 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the lock between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in place, and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete cast for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection with the north tower deck under construction, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up on a slope of about 3%.
Hazy, because the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "luck to be alive"
Three men have "luck to be alive" after being thrown off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck an alarm on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat continued to move by its own force.
"We saw the boat turn around near her and imagined the worst," said the head of the rescue station at Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of range until we let the water go," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was exhausted and found hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it detached itself from the person driving the boat when the boat capsized.
Someone watched over these men today.
Severely injured - man stabs on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had received the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholized offender cut up his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother down.
But she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
So she went out of the house with her partner.
On the street, they met the man's ex-living companion.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to his side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more committed in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
At the next Council meeting, the SPD proposes a "housing approach".
But quarrel is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
So far, there has been no regulation.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments will have to be designated as social housing in the future."
However, the favorable apartments can also arise in the inventory.
However, Bratmann said that the big issue in the City Hall was: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private space?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but possibly 20 percent of the apartments as social housing on such areas."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and will still have to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation on the housing market was worsening.
If the action plan is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.
But the program is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how can we compensate for the loss of another 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm said, outgoing bonds should now be bought by the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing apartments back into price-fixing.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved in one go.
In the Weststadt, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back there to the price fixation for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners, the housing companies do not want that.
Because if the number of social housing in the western city is increased drastically again, one is distanced from the goal of the so-called mixing.
There is no longer to be a concentration of disadvantaged people in just a few neighbourhoods.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must join in the boat."
They had concentrated on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But that does not mean that a compromise cannot be reached.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created from it).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest dropped somewhat before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the delusion and jumped off the sofa for the search.
In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently announced to the Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that people want to "take 30 minutes to get off the sofa" and "be active every day" came across deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are grumpy game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What the hell?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will diminish over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fit and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortless on the beam.
Stunning on the floor.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now finally also Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-battle title on Thursday and widened the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles turns on the float during the single multi-fighting final of the women in the art gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fighting title and the fifth overall, while strengthening her reputation of being the best of her generation or even of her generation.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, won 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I have ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women's single multi-fighting finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while serving as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during her long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - are adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She hasn't lost a multi-fighting competition since the summer of 2013, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even if Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was deceptive.
Floating beams and ground gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world title - lurked.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and put another one on it with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman gently embraced her as they awaited her finality - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Bile's shiny red, white and blue eyeliners, when the vision she once described in her collective book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Oma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in a serial killer case listening to music in the car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial killer case while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, can be read in the report.
The police announced that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not carry the purses or $2,900 owned by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt. police spokesman Jonathan Howard said that the shooting induced the investigators to get a closer look at whether she was associated with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two more injured in nine attacks, mainly in hispanic residential areas within four months.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A Witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is assumed to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge casings and secured a ball from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved.
Which is not at all true -- of course they got involved," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that he be institutionalized.
"My first answer was, 'I didn't know people were still doing that,'" said Picciuto.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still cannot speak.
But he's progressing slowly.
He can walk and cycle with support.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented for "Please sing me something."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the cica virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis for a long time, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the cika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare the emergency on Friday. More rainfall is expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, reports the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used for large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service reported that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabamas, a flood early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas via the stepped rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams were still picking people from the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said another stepson living nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water was pouring in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high point of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers saved all three of them in a large military truck and took them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "expanded quickly" as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the rains had caused the soil to become considerably full since Wednesday.
The authorities reported that heavy rainfall and road flooding caused rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which were now both flooded.
The head of Robby Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who were washed up by the flood.
Emergency shelters were set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond in the municipality of Tangipahoa almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to take along, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the City Council.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses were reported to be flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported until now on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "of bullets pierced", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police announce that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week for the second time that a 6-year-old child is being shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm and belly, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe this.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy's family informed the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found in the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are currently investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrator.
Investigators informed CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to have been a crossfire between several shooters.
Patron casings for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles oversaw the scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the sidewalk, there were tubes.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests occurred, and the police are reportedly checking the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-beater on her arm when she played outside her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in gymnastics for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of different skin colors.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, round off, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts has been an Afro-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected yet masterful gymastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but this is not what gym classes look like all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went the same way as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gyms maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list can be continued at will.
The majority of these gymnastic clubs are located in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must enable the communities, other than countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to have a more affordable and more accessible gymnastic training.
I founded my 20-year gym foundation.
At my events we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.
It's so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, grab so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to begin their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Residents want to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 interns voting in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract and said that the NHS would be in a "no-man's country" and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first interns are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work in order to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Residents, announced last night in a statement: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors are covered by the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through talks met with reluctance from the government and sometimes with deafening silence.
This happened to a promise made by Jeremy Hunt last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of the interns."
If he does not, the interns have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide cover for doctors on the strike line.
The ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 interns who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, called on the interns to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work struggle measures do not reach anything of the only little, but strain already overburdened teams and service providers and only cause the patients, carers and their families worries, distress and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Residents and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career break, training ksten, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of the seriousness of employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after the authorities have recommended that more people administer it for a longer period of time.
The anti-closing drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medication is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NHS regulatory authority NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NHS regulatory authority NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the artery walls that form plaques.
When the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
The draft guidance from NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidance does not recommend any treatment beyond this period.
Political Correctness Culture Blooms Election Deception in Muslim Areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the initiative of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud being knowingly ignored in Muslim communities like a devastating government report published today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and councillors for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "sensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so severe that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside election booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an ID card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At present, only one voter has to state his name and address.
The report suggests putting non-removable ink on a person's finger when they vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets electoral scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved of his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with Rassissmus and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have "run his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent postal vote - where older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including holding IDs to prove identity
His report states: "It was appropriate to prove that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists working on letter ballot papers to stop "election harvests."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before the election for your ID.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has cast her vote to prevent anyone from dialing twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limitation on requests for automatic postal choice.
Prohibition of political activists working on full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.
Give the police authority to set up perimeters around election stations.
An amendment to the law that facilitates an accusation of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksvertretungsgesetz 1983).
No photography in polling stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the poll booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no lawsuit was filed.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He became guilty for a number of reasons for being sufficiently - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abhak controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy about Kate's cyclist doppelganger and other famous doppelganger of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio this week got out of hand with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But 24-year-old Olympionikin is by no means the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who has his own famous doppelganger - at least not if one can believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympus that show more than just a certain similarity to Hollywood fame.
The Hunter and the Wolf: team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Besides Kate's doppelganger on the bike race track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. team in archery, has caused an onslaught on Twitter after pictures of the Wolf of Wall Street Star show up.
In fact, the archer got the madness on the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance myself, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I think I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly take centre stage this year: the striking similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to pass as a doppelganger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gear higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athlete version" of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to resemble an "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory placed in the room: According to this user, there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming relay outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
The Canadian CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "done like Mief" and during the race like "a pig died".
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to give more "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to close the gap with China.
Spectators across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane tweet, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay for women the following dimensions: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many questioned him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC program, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast."
It was an unfortunate formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized over 90 times to the people who responded to the notice on Twitter
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
Last night, we quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to our social media followers.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unhappy formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it should be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swim in the CBC Olympics show, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyers in Primark outraged by woman who tries on shameless underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underwear.
In order to make the situation worse, she patterned what she looked like in it, pulled it out and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried on her underwear, "she dressed again and left the shop without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the display, took off her own tights and trousers and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
"Everybody was staring when she took off her underwear again, which she obviously didn't like, since she put it back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, put on and went out again.
"She didn't seem to mind that she was watching - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried on."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that were wearing another person and that were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I heard, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they left - which is just as good."
"I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and moving out again and they weren't washed."
A Spokesman of Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9, at our Folkstone branch."
All eligible products have been withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself against weapons attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether they approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables for your robber.
When they approach you from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow in the face.
Then hit him in the groin with your knee and twist the gun out of his hands while the attacker bends in pain. Slap him in the face with the barrel and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the gun at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi pretends.
But remember that in the event of a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue for a travel guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveller subjected his immune system and strangle reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his train on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the rinsing button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but there are actually more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to flushing toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the film, he said, "I was relatively unconcerned about my health when I was a child, and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he certainly did justice to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample swab showed a luminometers number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "This is close to the worst I've smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at, at the same time, explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstorms that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say it like this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that made it easier for Ian to lick them and others that made it quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally used products containing lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delogation social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An antisocial family left their social housing after a delogation with damage of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After they were forcibly removed from their estate, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden planks were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.
The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for Cornwall Housing's house management, said that she was afraid that the apartment would not be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I think that people don't have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had inflicted on the family included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn open.
Neighbors said that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly to the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly delogged her and her partner from the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The delogation was hailed by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made hell.
One said, "You didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
On the overgrown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added, "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her behavior and that of her family, since delogging is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horribly watchful for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information, have done.
I hope that this development will comfort some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation
Workers of the house management will now have to clean up garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon was fined after committing herself guilty of possession of a class B drug in commercial intent.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
Police say she's gonna delogize tenants who don't follow house rules.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police announced that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-proclaiming, as well as to those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a low-flying military jet flying over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force dropped an incredible dive
Air forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists start panicking after a low-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost within reach over the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when, understandably, they began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming at them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said, "It flew really deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so low that it was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said that due to the poor visibility, the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to nearby surface fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was not endangered at any time.
Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, in which four people died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which limited his vision
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries about Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in the duel around the Spanish Supercup away against Sevilla FC, the rematch rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner has to do without Neymar, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament, in a show of strength with the defeated Cup finalist and reigning European League champion.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament dip in his knee during training, which at least for the time being solved the question of one with Barca in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique did not make a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other competitions the lead.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness condition of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince at the 3:2 in the rehearsal gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Seville, on the other hand, has to digest the 2:3 defeat after an extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The world rankings first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
As expected, the two Chinese made it into the final and took the title among themselves.
Thus it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would bring the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SVS-NE legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sets and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and let their protégés loose on their own in a fair competition.
"I played the matches here for my country."
"I play for myself in the final," Zhang had logically said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he determined the tempo on the record and left Zhang only 13 points from there.
Due to Ma's superiority, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
Nevertheless, enough breathtaking ball changes were to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, after which he was in medical treatment and had to "finally" settle for tin.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic Fourth in a similar high age of table tennis.
Donald Trump admits ′′serious problems′′ in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold Utah.
A rare moment when the normally large - headed and confident multimillionaire expressed some sort of concern, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah," Trump said to evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Blame was false reports about his candidacy, he again recorded his well-known media scam.
Republican strongholds wobble
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his Democratic competitor, Hillary Clinton, were on the same footing.
Other institutes include Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered endangered.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance again: "Just like I've done so far."
And afterwards: This will be "either successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
He does nothing but "tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump Party is said to have threatened to cut funds in support of its election campaign if it is unable to present better poll values.
Instead, the Republican candidates were to be given more support for Congress.
Olympia: Dristert fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's track and field athletes are threatened with trouble after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately establish a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya's team leadership by the doping inspectors.
The International Association of IAAF has requested information from the IOC on the case in order to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, gave up the rehearsal and signed it," explained Kenya's chief de mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become World Championship fourth in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters.
Four days earlier the Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been pulled from the Rio games.
He is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
The announcement of the IOC's more than 2000 doping target controls prior to the Rio Games has been unusually preceded by the fact that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the summer games in Brazil.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic Games began.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose doping is in compliance with the rules of WADA.
Kenya is considered a big runner nation.
The country's athletics won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
In a series of TV reports by the ARD, allegations have repeatedly been made that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a considerable mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that this sport has been doped across the board and systematically.
Russia's athletics were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With it a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he enthuses.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an elderly Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony with melancholy, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there's Maria's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
"She resembles me a lot, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli gives the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
These are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned a few weeks ago about her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn land and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is to prevent people from ever making this decision - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded an airplane towards Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was informed that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months became a widow.
Reid says Clinton will stay with Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election victory
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expected from Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman from Reid later said that he had not spoken to Clinton yet whether she would nominate Garland and he speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, being lackeys and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and men"
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differed from old school playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the Calendar does, too.
"We must return to the representation of timeless and classic nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release on the release of the Calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-nahmen Stiftung Dialog und Welt.
In the short term, the Kurdish community Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand," believes Ali Toprak, chairman of the association.
Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight against minorities and democratic opposition," says Ali Toprak, president of the association, of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal acts months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the foiled coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that itself takes refugees produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
In doing so, Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or displaced in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
A "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as a Gülen pendant destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
According to the newspaper, based on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany even before the coup.
As of 30 June, this had been 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all those recognised as eligible for asylum (39.625).
This survey does not include those fleeing war, poverty or lack of prospects.
Individually persecuted persons are entitled to asylum under the Basic Law exclusively politically, i.e. by the state.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the Landtag election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it is no more stupid than before: summer holidays, heat and country elections - that bites itself.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, travelling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and end up counting voices are hard to find.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let election campaigns pass by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say so at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what is left in the end suitable for coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, does an almost inconspicuous election campaign, you can look away from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the flourishing of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their "We create this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the fine office now.
The CDU with its leading candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's Bundestag election circle is located in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," lamented Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it is also a pity for no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the north-east CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with parasols and balloons.
This, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union, too, has noticed that it is breaking the ground in the country, that it must make a great effort to find a link with the people again.
She is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly available in the vastness of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow campaigners is self-explaining: "They must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because there is a lot at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the state parliament.
They turn the holiday emergency into a modern virtue and place their campaign largely on the Internet.
"Online election campaign", is the name of the country's chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaigners search for local voters among holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is currently curving through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Election leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty".
B27-Renovation: Restaurants suffer from blocking
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being rehabilitated.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at around 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They did it all pretty jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.
It's a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south as planned, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
It also praises the approach taken by those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up temporary accommodation.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
Citizens can now use the B 27 from Ofterdingen again on both sides.
The evasive traffic through the place seems to be going back.
"Some of the complaints were significant," says Florian King, Deputy Head of Administration responsible for transport management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many Schleichwege were looking for themselves and more familiar with their Navi than the signage.
As a result, some trucks in residential areas became frayed.
Since the speed limits were also not respected, the municipality demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant violations," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the ground.
Two to three per minute have already been flashed.
The fastest one was in the Tempo-30 zone at 77 kilometers per hour.
Since the construction site moved on, however, it has become quieter.
For the businessmen on the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the street is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don't like to look at the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 redevelopment has led to a decline in their sales makes everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produces for other companies, for whom the renovation has hardly any consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline" at the Maier car dealership, but also admits that, of course, "the running clientele is missing".
The most haunted are the restaurants along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
It's already life threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants had hit it "hard".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
He estimates that sales losses are "far over 50 percent".
The road renovation had "returned" its operation by two years.
He had to release half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half of them had been fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt replied to a question from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise profit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. Now it would also have to bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows about other counties, where such a thing was handled more generously.
With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars are now less frequent due to the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return after the renovation works have ended.
Despite the BSE and avian influenza crises, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers to be the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history.
Six months of construction work, that's brutal.
In the name of counter-terrorism, laws are constantly being tightened.
Following the recent attacks, Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior when presenting his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other further points would be discussed within the parties at first.
I am also involved in this.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was interested in results and a "reachable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has allowed a little time to pass before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But these are now all the more important.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: that a new security agency should take care of cracking encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities does not come as a surprise either.
In part, de Maizière is starting a second attempt at proposals that the SPD has not been able to make so far: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and take off the German passport for jihadists with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He nevertheless considered this to be reasonable and did not ask for anything that the coalition partner had no chances of doing anyway.
De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.
They have it in part: He plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for arresting people before deportation.
Refugees who are brought into the country in a targeted manner are to have their smartphones checked beforehand and to disclose social media accounts for a security check.
He wants to make some worse for rejected asylum seekers than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things also seem unextracted and leave questions unanswered.
And on a number of points - in the unequal treatment of the patient, for example - the question arises: what does that actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that were deeply occupied by people could not be excluded even in campaign times.
Internal security has been enormously focused.
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a stand on the subject of internal security.
In recent days, the two parties have been high.
First of all, there is a stern dispute over the federal police's equipment, then about a security policy collection of ideas by some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of department also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also trying to reconcile notes here.
He doesn't think he's going away from the double pass.
We pacified the discussion in Germany.
Opening it up anew would not make sense.
And with a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to show.
There's a lot of stuff in there that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also currently trying to make a stand out on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel cautiously signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen is still passing smoothly.
Despite diesel scandals, deliveries worldwide are increasing.
But not all markets are running smoothly.
There is a vortex about a term in the recall action.
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year with the deliveries more restrained.
Europe's largest car manufacturer can still show a plus in the course of the year, despite the diesel affair, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
In July, however, the VW core brand weakened, especially in Western Europe, thus again burdening the overall sales, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
The VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles worldwide in July with 449100 cars compared to the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent lower than in the same month last year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost one-sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July to two days less in Europe.
Moreover, in some core markets there had been "changed economic conditions" withholding from buying.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to withdraw from the EU also had a negative impact, one speaker explained.
In the USA, where the flue gas affair first escalated, there is also a minus.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected home brand of Lower Saxony is already further smoky through the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a drop in deliveries from 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales increase from January to July.
In this period, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to be converted into workshops.
In the course of the conversion VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles there was no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
After the conversion, the car manufacturer issued the customer with a "guaranteed equivalent" certificate, but did not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles on Friday.
The reason for this was legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Differences from this are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to the type approval will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop half a year after the conversion with an engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the customer's interest, it is also important to avoid that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, leads to uncertainty about possible warranty arrangements, as it was said.
That is why VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will demand fine interest from rich savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on current accounts or day-to-day money accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no sign in it: Normal savers would not have to "fear to pay fine for their austerity funds".
When banks deposit money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
Starting in September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will require private and corporate customers to return this fee to current or current account accounts for deposits of over 100,000 euros.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
He has been guarding 40 million euros for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not use.
"These are in my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank manager.
"I can't lay down 4,000 euros for every million."
According to the 'polluter pays' principle, he would now pass on the costs.
Leaving the cash in the safes of Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already seen four robberies, I don't want the fifth," said the bank board.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The cooperative association of Bavaria stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy stance causes considerable costs for all banks".
It was not possible to carry it alone "on a permanent basis".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014 with fines for deposits of up to three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive of the Banks Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay fees for deposits across the board, and competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said that at Lake Tegern there was "a clientele somewhat richer equipped with wealth".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if they keep money free.
Founded in 1911, Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The cooperative association of Bavaria "no other banks are currently known to charge a fee replacement for deposits from private customers," said Spokesman Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), stated: "The threshold to go into negatives vis-à-vis private customers is very, very high."
The competition was tough, and it threatened the migration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in width.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before rushing to the comment section to oversow him under the pseudonym NotAllSoneMenMiddlersAge with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-pronounced resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are likely to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a hoard by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and stultify wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something decisive like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers once lived - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of dates: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of dates: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is for a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and to buy again items that he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things where I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media horn, people who have heard about the comeback and who have been prompted to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I have had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom in followers of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that evoke happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.
That's what I do as a collector, and I think it's the way it is with a lot of people.
It is an easy way to engage in spiritual activity.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff member whispers from a record stack.
A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone came in here just recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who are only getting in slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex packed pop instead of experimental jazz drows out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.
None of them look very lonely, but gnawing psychological traumas are hard to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the shop for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records for sale.
She's more of a shop window walk than a big buy.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records isn't a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is..." it drives off with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be sampling the jeans hotpants, I'm watching a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art."
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are correct, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums, at least in record stores in Soho.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning strolling through record stores on Berwick Street and leafing through records, while avoiding the staring gaze of an eerie, 30-year-old false facilitator towering over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - Video report
Scientifically, the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who is investigating sharks, says that the record was in a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long.
French court rejects offer on demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has refused an offer from the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should have the power to tear down 72 temporary shops where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, provide hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and medical risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who did the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the prefecture of Calais's concerns were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened with tearing down was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run for non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian stated that the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of newcomers during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains militant
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, cyclist Tony Martin does not want to let himself be defeated.
"I keep my eye on the World Cup, stay confident and fight on," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar loaf.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He had to analyse calmly what reasons had led to the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the time trial World Championships in Qatar in October.
"I'm going to take a close look at everything we've changed lately."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time world champion who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on the 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennis professional Siegemund missed semi-finals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: the world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, could only perform her impact once and was powerless compared to the previous laps.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) still had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the Britishwoman Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German tennis professional to win a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the summer games had last played in 1992.
Never before was a German duo in an Olympic single semi-final.
Group increases start-up for live video game transmissions
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from this.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
On Thursday, Microsoft did not share how much money is flowing for the acquisition.
Beam only launched its offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and face enemies and provide equipment to players.
The game giant Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the start-up, which is currently based in Seattle, Washington, United States, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, nothing should change for the customers due to the takeover.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming video game activities is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by online retailer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google's mother alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's speeders have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: in various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are supposed to be particularly effective in transferring speed-setters.
The futuristic-looking Enforcement Trailers from Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident focus points, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure that the speed limit is observed with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days during continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be detected over several tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits and transit bans according to time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, you can move the trailer with any car with tow hitch in the high-speed state.
So that it is not simply stolen, it has been lowered in measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, also bulletproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France has recently ordered 100 units, after an order of 150 units last year.
UK picks up silver in 7-s Rugby after Fiji Masterclass takes gold
Britain's impressive performance in the 7-s Rugby came to an abrupt stop in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, rearrangement, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in top form in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Britishman will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost each game to the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This slump will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and had GB's attacks bounced off out of fun.
It felt like running on moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau was over in the corner.
With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai made another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
An outstanding tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the kickback and there was still over a minute of play ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pushed through further weak tackles of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29.0 until the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the mid-term and closed the Fijian gap...for four minutes, which was good for the first half until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant mid-play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waving flags and dancing in the grandstand.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked smashingly punched in the lawn.
Earlier that day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a tight semi-final match - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the post in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and with it the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the trainer's cancer to win the rowing
There won't be any more emotinal gold than in these games, and that means something.
From the first rowing stroke to the last, 220 hard hieves that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was all-present when they rowed for the second Olympic gold in a row without a driver in a row, the first women in the history of British sport who set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th undefeated commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the style of triumph.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive that day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he's a little risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014, outside of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, walking around the station -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that a few steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped right now.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the trial, stay in the trial."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to do something great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to show up at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the "Veitensteingruppe" water association, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is regarded as a "bayernwide exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
Thus it was said some time ago in the original tone in a contribution of the Bayerischer Rundfunk.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia honoured the Zweckverband.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "to be exemplary in Bavaria".
Behind all this stands Rupert Göller, who was an employee for 31 years in the Zweckverband, 28 of whom were managing directors.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach are members.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband back in 1988.
"Its tasks have been very diverse and ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance to office and organisational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the Chairman.
As outstanding events she mentioned the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the new purchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There had been no stalemate and innovations had been taken up again and again because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable, and correct ministry for 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heartblood for his Water Purpose Association and he has lived the Water Purpose Association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction in front of the Wasserforum of the district of Unterfranken.
He had received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
For his part, Rupert Göller praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water keeper, and he was a loyal squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the construction of wells and the restructuring of the Zweckverband.
But the biggest challenge and the most difficult use was the pipe break at the high tank near Kirchlauter on a 3rd January.
Here at minus 17 degrees will have to work all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Also the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
The soprano Anna Netrebko deals openly with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the illness was recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
However, the now eight-year-old Tiago has progressed well and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, when I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at La Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he's the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship Act in Bargteheide - Man shoots at partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multi-family house in Bargteheide, Stormarn County, at around 10:45 a.m. on Friday and fatally injured her.
"The man called us himself and said that he had shot his partner," said a police spokesperson.
The perpetrator is on the run, after him is publicly hunted.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about six feet tall, muscular, tanned and bald.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
In the meantime, the man wears a bald face.
I don't want to talk to the man directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, according to the police.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship".
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information on the course of the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a killing offense."
"That's all we're saying right now," said a police spokesperson in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Light for the German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the sector from the promotion of green electricity are off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy levy for existing plants for the so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry remains, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really glad that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers using gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry was threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced would an EEG levy of 20 percent be incurred.
However, this was not raised in the steel industry either.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on self-electricity production.
This would largely establish the status quo of the existing scheme.
Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry were of particular importance.
"With regard to our 'steel is the future' campaign, this is a first step."
"Others must follow."
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed against when reforming emissions trading," explained Jörg Hofmann, head of IG Metall in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened further when the world's largest producer country, China, threw massive steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
In the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, import duties imposed have had an effect on import steel, and on the other hand, economic prospects in China have brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry chief Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last but not least, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closures of individual plants.
Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month last year, as reported by the Steel Industry Association on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now decreased for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than in the previous year.
The association expects an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing is good for seniors
Ursel Kipp has accompanied singing all her life: as a young girl, she was in the school choir, in her teacher's degree, she took up the subject of music, and today, the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive overall, she says.
By the way, she does something good to her health and spirit.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
Through regular gatherings, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also had this experience in her choir: "To deny and organize oneself, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
This is because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of the air so quickly, even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Senior Citizens' Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together was much more important; it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people evokes many memories, often combined with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, even demented people realize long past events.
When singing, the head is also asked for a special performance, Lenz explains.
Focusing at the same time on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Older people, especially those who live alone, practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The sense of self-esteem also grows as a result of singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time for something, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if they think they have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church leader directly.
Many seniors choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbours for help with internet searches.
If you want to sing, please join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitively than hangovers to cries of young animals
In Hanover, biologists have investigated the effect of calling kittens on adult animals.
To their surprise, the Meowen did not leave the males cold either - however, they always behaved the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can recognize the arousal of kittens at the mouth of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to sounds from kittens who are in great distress, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH) have discovered.
Katers also react to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"The acoustic differences between the meowing of less and strongly excited young animals are obvious to the males either not perceptible or not significant," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten-scream differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult hangovers and eight female kittens from the MHH's animal husbandry were observed.
They were played on the one hand calls of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams from more excited kittens, which were also lifted up.
Despite the small sample, the researchers consider their results to be meaningful.
"All females, even those who did not have their own offspring, reacted differently to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when this call of the more excited kittens played.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby noise in humans several times.
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were mothers or not, according to biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski grabs Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match takes place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the arch rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the overthrow attempt in July, the government affirmed that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
Even before football is not stopped.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
According to this, the now American Sükurur is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days is still valid until October, in fact this has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" in public places throughout the country have declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
Like the whole country, sport is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Fans of the Besiktas workers' club in particular traditionally do not belong to the friends of the president.
But what unites the great majority of Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
Lukas Podolski will be the winner of the cup "Gala" in particular.
In the past season, Cologne proved its sporting value: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion was a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-round knockout in the Champions League, the Lions also retired early in the Europa League.
==References====External links==
The season wasn't good.
The trophy was the only way to win something.
"We did that and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For champion Besiktas, the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who set the base for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
After the coup attempt, Gomez had announced that he would not return due to the political situation in the country after his holiday at the European Championships.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" club boss Fikret Orman.
However, the striker would have to be prepared to forego about one third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman stated: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal chances at the Olympic Games in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been detained twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The subject of doping still dominates the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Juliya Jefimova, who had claimed her right to start shortly before the games after a doping lock, was mercilessly plucked out at her start (100 meters chest) and booed out.
There was a bizarre scenery: with a smile on her face she was still strutting into the hall and provoked with her appearance.
When it was established that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a cheering storm.
However, there are many more athletes who are taking part in the Olympic Games in Rio despite the doping past.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has run even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time World Champion had to complete a six-month ban in 2010 after having been shown to take the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had a severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic Champion of 2012, World Champion of 2013 and European Champion of 2010 to 2016 was tested positively for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the whitish intake and was banned for six months.
The four furthest litters this year go to the account of the great gold favoritin.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic Champion and twice World Champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and was closed for 21 months.
A penis enlargement agent was responsible, Merritt affirmed.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world so far.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was subsequently deprived of so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the 2006 EM title for testosterone abuse.
He was also awarded the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games on the basis of a judgement of the International Sports Court (CAS).
At 80.04 m he is in second place in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km Go, China): The world record holder and gold favoritin was tested positively only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of the intake of a forbidden food supplement, the ban of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and expired on 13 July.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said Thomas Schnöll, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave it again.
She planned her trip home for the beginning of September.
Whether Austrian citizens are also affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon is still unclear for the time being.
According to Schnöll, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs had exploded in an outing quarter on Thursday evening.
According to the police, one Thai woman had been killed and about 20 people injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosive devices went up again, and another person was killed, according to the authorities.
Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.
At the detonation near Patong beach, which is popular with tourists, a taxi driver was injured, according to police.
In Surat Thani, on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosive was blown up in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injured.
One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, they said.
"The bombing bombings bear the same signature," Army General Danai Kritmethavee said on Friday early in the morning to journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to comment on possible motives - but probably it was the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Over the past few days, the authorities had received intelligence evidence of impending attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the bomb explosions now taking place, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be complied with.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After clashes between the security forces and Muslim parts of the population, unnecessary travel to these provinces is discouraged.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This also gives the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
In 2014, after a period of bloody unrest, the militaryunta took over power, and it is to the benefit of itself that it has restored the Kingdom to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to control the Muslim rebel uprising that has been raging for years in the extreme south of the country.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Less than a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "identitarian movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government also placed the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' indications of efforts against the liberal democratic basic order," said head of the German Press Agency Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of the Constitutional Protection Agency in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants are defamed in an extremist way by Islamic faith or by the Middle East.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "multiculti delusion", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's identity through alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitarians".
Maaßen said that his authority had closely aligned with the national authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of the Constitutional Protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-friendly language, often with pop music.
That would do to Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a commercial for one's own cause.
Propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
It's dangerous.
Most recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts between the "identitarians" and AfD politicians.
Maassen said he had no knowledge of that.
For the constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind were only relevant from a certain point of view.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain persons, who are extremist, and thus becomes extremist.
The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This was not apparent.
With regard to the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maassen said that he was not yet talking about new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have noted in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorism structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming that are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide governance of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups had emerged at regional level or on social networks.
Maaßen was concerned about the fact that many attacks were committed by people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That is the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or, for example, elected CDU, SPD or left, but then radicalized by right-wing extremist sentiment."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is demonstrated by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer visible in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
In social networks, Habte became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a 48-second lag and finished 59th in 59th place.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
Following a "prosperity belly" the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only hit the 100-meter freestyle with one minute and almost five seconds, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also made.
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's race attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the performance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a run over 100 meters of freestyle alone.
Frenetically, Moussambani was cheered on at that time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at Neuer Platz has been robbed.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her shop around 5.30 p.m. on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she came back the next morning around 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the impending defeat as close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign in Florida.
If the election to the US president should not happen, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's going on vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential elections in November, he wouldn't care: "It's going to work out, or I'm on a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump said.
For example, he described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters retailing of electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle seems to be great.
The Post plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle as well.
In the near future, the Group wants to start trading with the transporter.
The post office wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to start selling to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether it should sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which is used to deliver letters and parcels, to other companies.
Post-CEO Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always inquiries, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn-based company intends to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly.
In the post-owned factory, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and that it would be able to make a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're relocating the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK leadership declines after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann will become the more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him will be missed.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After once again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the world's number five in the industry is facing a new human start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the Management Board will take over the former Management Board member Gerhard Hausruckinger as of 1 September, informed the company.
He is to officially assume the role of "CEO" until a successor for Hartmann has been found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesman did not want to name details on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear at the moment.
Investors said on Friday that shareholders had been disappointed in the continuing failure of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"However, the fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years," they said.
Given the recent poor GfK business figures, each shareholder would become restless at some point.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," they said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had not been able to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
In relation to the first half of the year, sales declined by 3.4 percent to EUR 721.2 million.
Profits in the second quarter were mainly affected by the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The goodwill write-downs of EUR 139 million that were required in the Consumer Experience business unit brought the Group a net loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips into cronies in ditches: Eight injured
In the event of an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers, eight people were injured in Krummhörn (Landkreis Aurich) on Thursday.
Two of the inmates suffered severe injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid, according to her information, a truck, which partly drove on the opposite runway.
The bus came off the road to the right and slipped into a ditch, according to a police spokesman Aurich/Wittmund.
"Due to the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire department freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and an ambulance came to the scene of the accident on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travellers were brought back by a bus to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
The investigators called on the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water will be 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater treatment plant from 1 October 2016; 3.36 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously 2.26 euros) and 3.64 euros for Azendorf (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an exaggerating calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the household by the Kulmbach district council, it was found that undercovers were occurring for these wastewater treatment plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-covering manner on the basis of legal grounds.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As administrative director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater plants of the market municipality was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and under-coveries from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt explained the serious increase in fees by reason of the fact that all three wastewater treatment plants are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water intake, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants decreased slightly.
Furthermore, in the previous calculation period, all three plants incurred a considerable amount of renovation and repair expenditure, not least due to their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf wastewater treatment plant due to damage.
In the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be completely overhauled and, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged out at the Lopp pond sewage treatment plant, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were accompanied by the continued care and maintenance costs, which have to be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still significantly below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low waste water flow in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance "completely penetrate".
Schmidt added that the market community has been spared from major maintenance costs for wastewater treatment plants over the past 20 years.
In Steinhäuser's view, the situation for these plants would remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water association could not be extended to include these plants because they were inadequate facilities.
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% was recorded.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% as measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3 %); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
As in the previous month, prices remained unchanged for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, property-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting Blackface or propagating white skin as a beauty ideal.
When this week it suggested a filter to some users that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies indicated a major problem that the company has diversity.
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was meant as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced rassism, the filter reminded of hurting clichés.
Others firmly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about the photos were widely distributed, wrote that the filter was "injuring and, to say the least, unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow sighted, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless fight for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older opponents - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much more difficult that such things go unnoticed than they used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that race-related controversy reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either, she does not have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in her workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company has recently hired a personnel manager who focuses on under-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said that she would leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that's not OK."
Military leadership falsified ISIS intelligence information, states Congressional Committee
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, reported a Congressional Investigation Committee in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information, typically nodded by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than they were," the report stated.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Kansas Republican Congressman, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to minimize the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were worried about manipulating reports about the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for drawing up intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff House of Representatives, in a statement.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged morale among analysts and "excessively gave room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that they did not find any evidence of White House intervention with the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon's Inspector General, which were received after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press spokesman for the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports from Congress while the investigation of the Inspector General is still underway.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).
However, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disagreements more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only envisaged a small occupation force in Iraq, and little time was spent worrying about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to government officials, Mr. Hooker's team found that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these temporary refineries would have commissioned to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in the Central Command.
The US wins fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is imminent
One day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of the people who keeps their gates in mind.
However, she knows that the American women are in the Olympic competition at 4-0 and are in first place in their group with the British women, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams within their group of six teams will win first and second place respectively.
The first-placed woman will stay out of the way of the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
However the game may end on Saturday, the American women have caused a surprising vortex due to their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), and at the age of 16 she became an American national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team, and things began to change for the better.
"A change of culture, mental change and physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to tear the rudder around completely.
On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a handshake from the local area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She sprinted with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and lupated the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging relay race between competition and pursuit.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is passed from crossbow shooter to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Letecky or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is present for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names, which are broadcast at Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in Olympic trampoline gymnastics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast-swimming and may it last for a long time.
But if I am modestly allowed to make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw my attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it debuted in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived for the past 16 years that many of those I had interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the Cartoon-like trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means "jumpboard."
Rising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to make a series of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopefuls need to go further, faster, up and above in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also another scornful goal in the television broadcast: the world's or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I feel a bit tiring when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a respite.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up.
Forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here, too, there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no bulging into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the aggravation and objectification of male athletes - as suggested recently by the male U.S. gymnasts according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base that is struggling for air.
"One generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed in gunfire during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses reported that police shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos circulating about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is after Nigeria the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the suppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and these have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The entire youth protested.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to the stranglehold in terms of the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the Eritrean border; a struggle for this jagged, contentious line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, who have been more or less defeated in recent years, may exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of simmering under the surface are now exploding.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly from Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But that too is changing.
"We are coordinating under an umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly savvy in detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using Special Representatives to deal with opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't have the confidence of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, seemed to have been botched by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal displeasure.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked businesses run by Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge walk."
Donald Trump declares his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group was not meant seriously.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate with the American public in a clear and understandable way.
It also puts his comrades-in-arms, who try to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant.
After making the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rowed back on Thursday's claim and insisted in interviews that he really didn't intend to imply that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism descends on Mr. Trump while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already advanced sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he made strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course, I meant that sarcastically."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clear" depending on how the reaction turns out." said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone as his polls have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal comrades in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by refraining from aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the Pennsylvania campaign on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" TV experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.
Once pushed out of the market by the price, Café returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel excepted and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is change, then it's reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who owns and manages the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide funds for a new branch, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34 years old, lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she'd be on her way.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after quarter of seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they prepare my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't have a grudge about the soap business taking over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the café's cold brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to go into her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular and said that he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing eating of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his promotion to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a passion for sophisticated Fifth Avenue delicacies such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was somewhat more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman tells about life in a house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective in her book "97 Orchard".
Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, straightforward snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mix.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about food in the Great Depression era.
"Reich-containing foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that extends the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinners.
Coe grinned.
"It must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country was dealing with being no longer the Schlaraffenland.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for the Americans," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: Mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a crummy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the focus of American cuisine for years, has become a rare luxury.
Strange blends were tried because a high - calorie and nourishing satisfaction had priority over taste or even common sense of the kitchen.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunch," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions don't match.
It was typical of many of the housekeeping recipes.
As never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits so hard.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and to live up to the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-eating attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the million-strong man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Ms. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolately prepared."
Many of the ways of dealing with food from the Great Depression era were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to give humble recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone resentfully dipped a spoon in the tough, brown glitter.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a reference three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to Bild-Zeitung, has saved nearly 60,000 lives.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civilian protector showing him in an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
However, as a hero, he never saw himself, according to the picture, "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think that God sees in me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffering from shortness of breath.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland Shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks don't grow up until they're 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims leisurely along the bottom of the North Atlantic, and in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.
This slow lifestyle, however, seems to be a recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least about a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.
Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which represents a world record for vertebrate animals.
The evolutionary biologist had long suspected that Greenland sharks would become stone-old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers therefore know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
However, these sharks still make prey: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for carcasses that are staggering down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen from Greenland or Spitsbergen between 2010 and 2013 as by-catches from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest was 502 centimetres long.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments hurled larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, however, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it probably celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which are produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeter long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.
It was known that female Greenland sharks only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks obviously take at least one and a half centuries with the propagation.
This, too, is likely to be a world record for vertebrate animals.
It is no coincidence that such methuses live mainly in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip on its neck, was also captured from Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame of savings.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in a double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on topics related to construction.
With ease, the panel adopted the statement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the land, parceling and development issues could be clarified and the applications for surveying could be submitted, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - extension section 1) to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and spooky seniors alike.
As it was said, constructionists can now report to the town hall, and the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots in its September meeting.
In order to be able to respond to requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises, combined with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the new land use plan in sub-areas only in the spring of this year.
For example, in the area of low-time larn, the already designated industrial area is extended by two parcels towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city of Am Main thus has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far had enough authorisation in the UK.
That's what big U.S. banks are using.
Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
According to the IW, Frankfurt is represented by the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board.
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as it enables them to communicate directly with supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, it is also worse off in terms of infrastructure than Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city scores with easily available commercial properties.
"It is not easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine, the rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking by Mercer, the city ranked seventh, Luxembourg ranked 19th, Dublin ranked 33rd and Paris 37th.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," concludes the IW.
However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economists say.
The balance of power also speaks for this: According to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector in London at the end of 2015, compared to 62,500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the Hepatits C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a $200 million compensation for the infringement of two Merck patents related to the Blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US judge exposed a pattern of misconduct on the part of Mercks, including perjury and other unethical acts.
When filing the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to remission of the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to match Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work that was based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently combing through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish informed the Manbij Military Council of Reuters, allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we're doing clean-up work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Redehonoraren; the former Secretary of State reported an income of USD 3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton's candidate for vice president, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, has published his tax returns for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backslidings regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not legally obliged to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"They're on the move," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, regarding the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax audits are completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations to charitable organizations, his business conduct, and various other links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already jumped on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-ranking Republican Trump calls for his tax return to be published.
On Thursday, she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990s for two years, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday, saying that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that individuals earning more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said that he had also been subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump was "fearing" of the voters and not of the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax return of 2015 showed that these only received USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most of the Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and income of USD 109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going to human-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which already had the idea years ago, has intensified its support together with US nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and harvest without hurting animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the Toolkit, we have seen a change in their attitude within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can stop the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," said the CEO of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "Chili Cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust of chili powder into the air.
A touch quite usually already out to chase the elephant away.
A last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rain firework into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City council unanimously decides: No new kiosk building on the St. Goar Rhine shore
Normally, the St. Goarer take on investment projects by traders with kiss hands - because especially the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council has now unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but this kiosk does not fit at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli code was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he had revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli primary, as it had "demanded" Arab guests according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", left out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was an "intentional decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the primary code be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this happened in Germany in this very hotel chain is even more disgraceful.
That doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big response on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "relented" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Be ashamed," said another post that pointed out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all accusations and called the incident an "accident" and "apologies" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct order to not include Israel in the rapid election list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after mass demonstrators took to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate to withdraw her from office.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagayan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies' interest in business in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador said.
Russian companies establish existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further development of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagayan.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent in jumps and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million.
The trade upturn was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian embassy issued some 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year, are being broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses Wanted: Beverage Market Robbery in Waldbröl
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening at the beverage market of Rewe XXL on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
With the maintenance of a gun, three darkly dressed people who had mumbled their faces demanded the release of cash from the employees of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
The police do not share the amount of money that has been collected.
The perpetrators were said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the park deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
The perpetrators must have run after the attack towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking garage entrance with the silver colored car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations in connection with the robbery at the time of the crime (around 7:45 p.m.) should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Play and fun during summer holidays
The children and young people of the social pedagogy day group/social group work of the Kinderschutzbund Nagold spent eight beautiful and happy days with their carers on their summer break in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located Freizeitheim Hardtwäldle the joyous group was accommodated during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day trips were on the agenda.
On the one hand, we went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and splash.
Culinaryly, children and carers were spoiled with their homemade body dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewels from pearls and stones were created, or a Roman mill game was made from wood.
Other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Bunte Abend".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and youths returned home contentedly.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministrates from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage to Rome of all the ministrants in the next two years, the Oberministrantenrunde St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally they decided on the bishop's town of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the gate of mercy opened for this purpose at the Freiburg Cathedral.
16 Minis of bitter lions, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set out.
The evening before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim's crosses and granted the pilgrim's blessing.
From Horb by train was driven to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and thus the pilgrimage path was started by the Münster.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches took a rest again and again to sing a song together from specially compiled pilgrim songbook.
For the overnight stays there were parish homes of the local parishes available.
At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most demanding route, had to first descend about 500 meters of altitude and then be climbed again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage in Freiburg.
Visually relieved and happy, the Minis arrived later in the afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening Mass in Münster the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scotsman Callum Skinner storms home when Brite wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men's sprint at the Velodrom in Rio when the British team defended the title of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The boy's pound made the legend proud when he stormed home to take home a victory from the favourites New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place at the London World Railway Championships in March, despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in time when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was down a short time after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed onto the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately fell on the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags in the grandstand."
We've been together as a team for the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win the Olympics again.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form Kennys it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (an apparently sacred date for British sport; that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born).
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny will take part in the sprint next, which starts today and will last for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the finish line in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, in which Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had argued with officials before the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260 in the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and finish tomorrow.
The GB team relies on its strong rail cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a host of medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas took place in the background, such as the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and bullying accusations as well as the retirement of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland smelting due to cancellation of the energy contract questionable
The future of Portland's aluminium melt in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs are at stake at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
No fewer than 2000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be at risk from closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting plant, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa melting plant in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity from the melting plant," the company announced.
AGL also stated that the contracts were so-called "security transactions", which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"This is why AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on revenues on AGL from GJ 18 onwards are currently limited by the projections of the strong forward markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts at its annual close of $ 187 million in "anticipated termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts did not affect the "ability of Alcoa to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant."
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of explaining why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the potential closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Referring to analysts' statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity annually and tomago consumes around 900 megawatts of electricity.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
And for us as generators, that would not be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, who ran at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget their sister's cover and end with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a radio station at 8 a.m.), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her in the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September edition is Vogue's most sold edition of the year.
With a size similar to a picture book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages of the Wälzer were advertising from the 832 pages).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leaked before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have been clearly more "famouss who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the small chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if all of this applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't appeal to everyone.
With her reality TV story Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, criticized her and called her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the grievance seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.
In the truest sense of the word, it is a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your primer of Estee Lauder.
They and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Municipal Law Centres Distinguish 160,000 People Every Year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is prepared for the impact of further cuts in funds on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need of help, victims of violence, and those who do not have the resources for unjust delogation and the like - have already been dismissed in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overly busy, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the Community Law Centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without lifting the Federal Government's decision.
"Queensland's community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of people from Queensland who are more in need of help will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Federal Justice Minister as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their client communities and that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after being told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun at an employee in February while they were on a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini claimed to have waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, " drew a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run into Vincent's knee throat," Bordini stated in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate started a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the Second Amendment people - gun owners and gun friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and appointed judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint demands damages from the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for personal injury and lasting mental damage.
Trump's press secretary Hope Hicks was not available for a statement.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
No response was received to calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) show significant losses for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could just as easily continue to rule, this is not possible according to the survey figures in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and thus have a good chance of continuing to represent the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party would only be close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4%), the AfD would be represented in the Landtag for the first time with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens moved back to the Schweriner Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only be 23 percent in the Berlin election (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4%.
It would thus still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
At 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, whereas the pirates would miss the move-in in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would now be enough for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as a "office in the back pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator could be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be opened similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.
The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's been different since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns' mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, and was eventually sold and settled to Microsoft.
Today, suppliers dominate the market, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Always be online everywhere, that's everyday life for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, with Samsung and Apple alone accounting for 555 million units.
The global turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there are the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market only came at the beginning of 2007, at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all easy to use by touch screen.
The triumph of Apple began, even today the iPhone is the most important product of the company.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, were in decline.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for personnel on the Siemens Board of Management.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow's biggest attraction, just as it was in London in 2012, when we made a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in economic growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which has been voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to the T2 built in the middle of the world's two most frequented catwalks.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, supported by £16 billion of private investment.
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.
It is time we steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to avoid ad blocking are equivalent to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program in order to again block advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect ad blockings to detect which part of the site is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock's spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-back battle between the ad blocking open source community and the surrounding communities has been underway since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicator blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile phone advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson announced.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large proportion of revenue, so that Facebook considers the investment of such a step worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preferences tool" to give people more control over advertising targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," said a Facebook spokesman in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as ad preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman in suspected suicide on Swiss highway run over
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday in the event of a suspected suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police in Vaud declared.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interrogated, but some have still not been identified, the police said, asking them and every witness to the incident to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person was running on the highway in the dark - it was decided that drivers would not have to assume that a pedestrian would walk on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after she ran over and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and passed out on the street, heard the court.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified way, and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-density atmosphere could have once had earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and still slowly kept turning.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent duller.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought to be by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect was left -- Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche's coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday, leading to a lack of co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternate President/General Manager of Colorado's Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately be looking for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I've fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations at Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I have been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth, this it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
It must also have a right of participation in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the Avalanches in 2013-14, Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was defeated in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and dropped five points behind the Wild for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, strike
The labour disputes on wages for North Sea oil workers are being suspended, while all parties to the dispute are sitting at the table for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Units and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will start early next year to re-address the problems.
The unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut rates on its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate reduction follows a 10-percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts will give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has dismissed thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it rationalizes its operations as a result of its mega-merger with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation which had been exacerbated by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many, not just a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data help astronomers to understand why stars in the cluster rotate to different rates as well as how the rotational periods are related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Pleiades cluster of stars is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which emerged about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're spinning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotational rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades' "ballet" we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the cluster of stars of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotation rates.
"The Pleiades cluster of stars provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us about what we would like to learn more about how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes", so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of Pleiades rotation rates, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
Alex Rodriguez's tears ran faster than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees' jersey one last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12th.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was selected as the most valuable player in the league three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
He was signed under a ten-year contract and has received $27 million a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will be acting as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back with performance for a long time.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees, he achieved several milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the fame hall of baseball.
Because as successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect of having received performance-promoting funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014 because I spent 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said süffisantly at the time.
Even his farewell days don't go noiseless.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and is being told about the relationship with pop star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy expressions from the fans of the Yankee Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Got it: Because of a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping events have become known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre-obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - just before the start of the already critically eyed athletics competitions, these news are untimely.
The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, had already been detected in Chen last Sunday.
The International Sports Court of CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the 50 m freestyle runs.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B sample and for a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the CAS is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio the news about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa leaked, the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said, "an incredible shock," to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is supposed to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample was said to have been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov immediately spoke out with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday the case of "Adrian Zielinski" became known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon like his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the Danekowa case is another serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
Apart from one exception, the IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from taking part due to systematic doping, and the Kenyan running nation also produced a lot of bad news in Rio.
In swimming sport, the former offenses in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the 200 m freestyle podium, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the center of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and no respect for doping scammers," he said.
Sun had been positively tested for the stimulant trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese Championships, but only had to do a three-month lockdown.
Datenklaub: So perfide hackers extort their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists, malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of an attack using blackmail software at least once in the past twelve months, sometimes several times.
In Germany almost 20 percent of the companies were already once the target of ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
The perpetrators are focusing their blackmailer software on attacks in corporate networks according to the observations of malwarebytes.
If they succeed there, the potential ransom to be extorted is much higher than that of private users.
"We are currently observing a frighteningly rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks took place alarmingly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the end encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stands still.
Accordingly, the damage is higher if a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business activities, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of downtime in the operation.
The hackers, on the other hand, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.
They tell their victims by chat how to pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming increasingly professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."
However, it is more likely that there are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, looks and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal, and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers to spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to defend ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful erpeßung, the perpetrators threaten instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, depending on the type of data, the damage potential is still many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, seems rather small, passengers have plenty of space both in the front row and in the rear, it does not seem narrow at any point.
The materials of the interior are well-worked and look pleasant, only the cockpit top is a bit off.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in storage space.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l with raised and 1026 l with folded backrests available, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seating areas of the back seat can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his work a little more quietly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-litre gasoline engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
A four-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Emergency Braking Assist (working until 32 p.m.), the collision warning system and the lane stop assist.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when shunting.
The high-beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller reacts to the traffic sign recognition and slows down the speed if necessary.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to achieve.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you don't want to invest so much, you get the petrol engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued that liability is only conceivable in the event of risks typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Sickness: When does the organizer pay
After their trip, sick vacationers only get money back if the cause of the illness can be found in the hotel without any doubt.
But this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to have the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, a family was severely ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which allegedly had polluted the sea water.
The family felt that the trip was defective - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
However, the organiser only learned about this shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the seawater was fine.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the verdict.
Especially as no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion with each other - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state had to react calmly and decisively at the same time to terrorist threats.
It is certain that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not allow terrorists to triumph.
If criminals were to leave the country more quickly, however, this would increase security and also increase the population's support for refugee policy.
De Maizière intends to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further reinforcement of the security forces, "in the medium four-digit order of magnitude over several years".
Sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
The aim is to improve video surveillance and to amend the law on arms in such a way as to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
According to de Maizières, the obligation of silence for doctors, which has recently been widely discussed, is to be maintained.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk to citizens, he said, for example, to psychological abnormalities.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
De Maizière plans to use covert investigators to prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet).
SPD leader Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior spoke out clearly against actionism.
"That was a slap in the face for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union following a Burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considered a general ban on full concealment to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
One could talk about rules, for example in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green chief Simone Peter accused the minister of his intention to simulate the effectiveness and ability to act with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left-wing party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet sayings and a tightening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It regularly stands on the bypass - here is a picture of November.
But this is to change: the right-hand lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who are in traffic every evening on the surrounding road when driving via the motorway (A 43).
The Landesbetrieb Straßenbau will extend the right-hand lane by 700 metres next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit.
Drivers can then thread directly from Hammer Straße to the right.
The big advantage: traffic splits up more early, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The narrowing of the road on the feeder bothers the drivers especially between 5 pm and 7 pm.
On weekdays, the backlog extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is only one-tracked over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be dismantled about a quarter of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to take up mainly heavy-duty traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated traffic jam will last cannot be said by the responsible national company.
However, years can be expected: the bridge has an official remaining useful life until 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand lane, the state company has deliberately chosen the less traffic-related time during the school holidays, because disabilities are to be expected.
Traffic will be one-tracked past the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural journey: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the Waldschule attended the play "Das Invisiblee Haus".
The Nima's association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended a performance of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" of the Junge Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima's association, 19 pupils between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the production in the Kleine Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most of the young people in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they had been able to follow the course of the story, according to the press release of the Junge Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without an escape and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language education are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: Hope for weather improvement
The weather made the Sternschnuppen-Guckern in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a dash through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night was bad for observing the sky spectacle due to clouds and rain, said Hans-Ulrich Keller, chairman of the observatory Welzheim, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will see many shooting stars in the sky.
The stellar scales are Perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216000 kilometres per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips against Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep even far before the alarm clock rings.
It's anything but restful.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently feel that their sleep is not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on various causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood by this is the insomnia, i.e. an insomnia and a sleep disorder.
It is precisely sleeping through that many people find unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Family Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medication, can be behind this.
Sleep disorder is often the expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is common, especially in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you may get sick, wake up every two to three hours, and you may start to ponder about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with trouble sleeping?
If you do not sleep well for at least three nights a week for a period of one month and are affected during the day, weeß advises you to go to the doctor.
The impairment can look quite different: one is depressed, tired, unsleeping, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.
To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
Delayed sleep physicians hardly exist in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, weeß advises that you should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems.
He can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For example, medical doctors advise on snoring with breathing droppings, pathological daytime tiredness, sleepwalkers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't take a nap," Fietze says.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a nose glasses, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can people get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a few adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleeping and rising times, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then one starts to calculate immediately, and this is not at all beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler spoke on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had won gold for the first time at the World Short Speed Championships in Doha and set his first world record at the same time.
The former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now turned against his critical ex-team colleagues via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets €20,000 and a jungle king €150,000, no one should wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The promotion system in swimming sport was bad, but the doping controls were very good.
This does not allow us to compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look very closely or even operate on the subject of doping.
"I am not saying that controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly how it should be with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled by independent controllers of WADA/FINA for a certain period of time before WM/OS is not allowed to participate", demands the Electoral Hamburger, who now operates an ice cream parlour.
Airport: gang of baggage thieves arrested
Professional Thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 were arrested by the Düsseldorf police.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage thefts as gangs.
At around 9.30 p.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July of this year and had been involved in community, work and particularly professional activities.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who entered Germany specifically for the commission of crimes.
They had collected more than 15,000 euros in total.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between another cobblestone pavement: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this at first glance, but the police rank it among the "hazardous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biostore.
Someone sprayed "ugly!" on the facade of a grey house.
Opposite a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, is already being built: By 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are preferably illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Senator Henkel in particular had repeatedly advocated a tough approach by the police against the project, called the area a "no-go zone" for police officers, and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
After the ground floor rooms, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrolled for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.
This summer afternoon, the street is peaceful: parents are walking with children, people are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking before late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
Together with the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a neighbourhood that mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The trench opened by the Berlin Senator and the police between squatters and their neighbors apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Occupancy and the housing projects that were born from it have long been part of the neighbourhood: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to the Rigaer.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a real street battle under great police command, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are partly still inhabited today by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and berlin voters from all over the world in recent years: residents from GDR times and former squatters now share their neighbourhood with them.
This is also noticeable for rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent for new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they can be seen on thrown windows or freshly painted facades, which have been thrown with paint bags.
No other street was so often mentioned this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbours view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as assault are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes involve damage to property, which tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenement house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is reassuring: the people in 94 are their neighbors, they certainly did not.
Even the famous burning cars have not existed in Riga for a long time.
For the trained architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer deliberately moved to Rigaer Straße - and stayed.
That's why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the authority of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road is still being taken away from them: through faceless new constructions in former building gaps that displace the old inhabitants.
"These are, after all, condominiums that are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well smitten live here," she says.
"Violence and destruction I can't condone at all."
But what should you do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are attracted to paint bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.
Those who move here should be aware of this - just as someone who moves to a pub district can hardly complain about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the point of contact for integration and organiser.
Besides, she's a social worker on the ground.
Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach since July.
The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as the point of contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine customer of the working group indicates that volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying wool milk sow, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less scoffing than much of the desired areas of responsibility - meant that the administration wanted to write the job out.
An administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought, just an egg-laying wool milk sow.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organisation, working with local people and behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has a 50 percent post limited to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, supporting Annika Deuschle's honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.
New containers will soon be on the Wasenstraße
For some time now, it has been a serious problem to find accommodation for the refugees who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for connecting accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private dwellings.
It does not work so far, but one is dependent on private dwellings, says Deuschle.
Therefore, common dwellings need to be upgraded, as they say.
So new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.
But it is not done only with apartments.
Perspektive is the key word, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or established.
"More seats would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do charitable work - and this is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive impact.
This is "no employment therapy".
However, activity does not only mean work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So this is where the administration and volunteers come in.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures was a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and that they can bridging time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and is useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
However, there are also problems, customer honestly says, "people with whom nothing is possible". Therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always also to motivate others.
It's all a mammoth task.
A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalisation after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some people might call naive." However, a residual risk cannot and will not exclude it.
But the helpers are already sensitive.
These incidents were also the subject of the refugees.
They'd be afraid the assassins would completely discredit her.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunden.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, primary and volunteer workers have to be on the lookout for activities on the ground and in the region.
They always have in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
Politics is afraid to answer this question clearly.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the previous people in a reasonable way.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Burglars wanted by helicopter
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men forcibly entered an apartment in an apartment in an apartment building in Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8:50 a.m.
The resident surprised the two and beat the unhappiness into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, wearing both blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled to downtown.
The police deployed several patrol crews and a police helicopter for the search.
The APB was unsuccessful.
The unknowns may have been noticed near the apartment or on their escape before the act.
