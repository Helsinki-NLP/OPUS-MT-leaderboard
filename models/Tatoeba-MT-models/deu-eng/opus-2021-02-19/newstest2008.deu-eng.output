Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the eurozone was the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 euro-zone countries, inflation was higher than expected in November, with an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent after 2.6 per cent in October, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the interest rate, which, in its discretion, would favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment to create a spiral of inflation.
The ECB strives to keep inflation below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in a dilemma: one has to "reciprocate" inflation in order to exclude the need for action at a later stage.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a twelve-year record high in November; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the eurozone was driven by rising food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations increased by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in the price of edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but is expected to fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but estimate the annual average rate at 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup Orts Government Crisis
After a long stagnant period, the number of Fidesz sympathizers increased considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002 the party has the largest base camp, while the approval for the socialists according to Gallup has reached an unprecedented low point of 13 percent.
In the case of party-faith voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to one fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entry hurdle: they reach two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic sentiment has deteriorated further - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "very bad" been so high (41 percent), while a further 46 percent consider it "quite bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth assumes a improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December revealed that 71% of respondents - a historical high - considered the Prime Minister's work to be "rather bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great trust or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters of Viktor Orbán accounts for 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% distrust of the leader of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of those who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be managed without a change of government.
After the riots last October, when 35% of the government and the head of government were still in favour of staying, this figure is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) see the solution only in new elections.
When asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would "participate with certainty" and another 20 percent would "probably" vote.
By way of comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 per cent would go to the polls "with certainty", while another 15 per cent would consider their participation "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
Moved to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the percentage of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be 81, 84, or 89 percent.
Also most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the commercial area of Budaörser have also maintained the average price increase of 16% of last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" rose by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF were registered in all hypermarkets.
Since prices in the food markets were "galoped" last December, the inflation rate has not been dramatic in percentage terms compared to the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it is certainly discouraging for consumers that what they had paid well under 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the same level as the previous year, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy poppy were up sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but Auchan had 1kg of bread wakes for 139 forints.
There was no competitive drop in the price of the product to below 200 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Auchan performed the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 percent compared to the Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have increased each by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest basket of the previous year and the most expensive one of today's year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive one of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was 1,206,00 Forint, but the increase in value added tax was noticeable in the prices at the last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has hit trade badly: it seems that department stores were not able to quite decide which price range they should apply to the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were incalculable.
(If the trader is poorly planning the speed of circulation of a product, it can fall for substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to the value-added tax, the inflation of the "Napi" shopping cart last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference with the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office found more than 30% inflation over a 12-month period.
So in about beside flour also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has risen by hardly more than 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to shift the drastic price increase to the multis.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the golden trade triangle; good years are constantly reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores are no longer looking at prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, durable food goes in pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning in the morning, there were endless queues at the cash desk in all three department stores when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to opinion polls that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overburdening of personnel - all factors that are not exactly conducive to containment of infections, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital, MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection.
The injured person of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with MRSA infection. An important operation could not be performed since then because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient’s body.
By 10 December of this year, the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System reported infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens from hospitals in 1094, according to Karolina Böröcz, head of the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, but the figure is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in its nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually react well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the drugs are given too high or used improperly, the well-responding bacteria produce antibiotic-resistant products that spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
These bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, especially in patients with a weakened immune system, or with a permanently poor immune system, but also in older patients or patients with low body weight.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the everyday life of the sick.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA only does not exist where it is not wanted.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff carries rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment," says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are examined for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for the control of the formation or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the patients and isolate MRSA infected patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not so common in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the state health insurance fund for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the Epidemiology Center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and disease patterns in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the product, but this directive is not always adhered to by hospitals.
Among the outpatients or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling is even rarer, says Karolina Böröcz.
Disinfectants are saved
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transferred from one patient to the other by the nursing staff.
It is precisely for this reason that hand washing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the local hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
In fact, the rooms are often crowded, the beds lined up close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the less well-off hospitals, it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that almost favour the development of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes the health insurances enormous costs, therefore they are combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government program.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Death Lector Policeman Was Not Drunk
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official report is now available.
The now resigned police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press officer of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday, after the official report on the case was presented.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before driving.
The former police chief, with his own car in the XXII district, turned into Kossuth Lajos Straße and ran over a 55-year-old man who crossed the street in an unmarked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, lag .)
The pedestrian died after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then withdrew his functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has opened its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday totalling EUR 400 million, to be channelled into education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented with Cohesion Fund grants. The EUR 100 million loan agreement has already been signed earlier and the current agreement concerns the use of the EUR 200 million loan.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be channelled into research and development programmes at Debrecen University.
At the meeting, the U-Bahn line 4 was also mentioned.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the metro financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR-linked, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, commission-free.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe looks attentively at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys in the EU's still cheapest market, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is without a doubt the most sought-after pavement for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historical towns Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will also attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russe has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office space offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfers' paradises, and thus to attract tourists in addition to the summer and winter season also in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying in on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria also seek to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while the Black Sea and ski resorts are predominantly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle buy either revitalized real estate for 50-100,000 euros, or run-down houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are important, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of businessmen who invest with the aim of increasing their value in the medium to long term.
Real estate in the capital, however, is constantly becoming more expensive, as a result of ever-increasing demand.
In the EU, real estate prices are lowest in Bulgaria, but there has been an annual increase of 21 percent in the last five years.
The inflation in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission-reducing measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
There is currently a fierce debate between developed and developing countries.
The US has already signalled that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question at the conference is whether developed countries are prepared to provide both financial and technological support to developing countries in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on support for developing countries was also reached.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member council, which is expected to be at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as the "Piac és Profit" reads.
Hungary’s Six Percent
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its lead in global climate action and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured according to 1990 values), regardless of whether the "after-2012 agreement" was successfully achieved, or not. The Union would even be prepared to commit to a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to do their best and responsibly to meet their commitments.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its then 15 member states, had already committed to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will certainly meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not come into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction plans set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which was also emphasised by the IPCC, the international Nobel Peace Prize-winning scientific climate change committee of the UN in its recent report.
This would delay the emission reduction and increase the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
Initially, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special Forces stationed in Afghanistan have been launching videos of operations conducted against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The images filmed with helmet-mounted miniature cameras are controlled at the air base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message unavoidable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under Defenceheadquarters in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, as well as the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFIs) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
According to defence expert Gordon Mackenzie on the BBC, propaganda published in this way is almost free of charge compared to conventional television commercials, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, since they confirm the existence of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army also has to fight against amateur recordings, which besides the carefully edited, censored recordings also make it into the net - such as those which show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, at most, the losses are talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, from the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, many videos shot in use have already been loaded onto the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "genus" for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-splitting simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsch in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means squeamish: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a work conference at which her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas mood with raffles or kicks into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how the power celebrates.
Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The largest Christmas party of a ministry is held in the Defense Department this year, but the ministry's staff are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
In comparison to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NRP) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport are pushing over the strands.
The 4,32 million Forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of the Future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected.
The main focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a raffle of raffles.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The room rental amounted to 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a section of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt did not confirm this information, as we did not reach the persons responsible.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was announced that there was no obligation to dress or suit at the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government are preparing for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference on the end of the year.
It is expected that about 180 guests - according to the press department - will only be entertained with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration runs out with 350,000 forints.
Minister of Self-Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the Ministry's auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas party in its own banquet hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured with 2,500 forints per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kicking.
Since the beginning of János Veres' term of office, PM employees have been celebrating in this way every year.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the Minister's official speech, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites to a New Year reception on 20 January, the Christmas celebration of the Ministry is cancelled this time.
One hundred guests are asked to visit Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the department, the expenditures are estimated at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary are invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a brief speech by the minister and end with a restrained feast.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not provide any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is organized in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions are forming their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite duration of the strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly is held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work stop begins.
Strike-related, significant traffic obstructions are expected, as rail transport is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced on Friday afternoon by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large-scale protest assembly is held on Saturday, and as of Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will cease to work indefinitely unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike started on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees meet to discuss the further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will take place only in the late evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes starting on Monday will have to be reckoned with considerable traffic obstructions: the railway workers put down their work for an indefinite period, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of Volán's companies stop.
At the same time, there will be motorway closures in many places in one direction.
The call for strike was followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, while others plan to stop working on a temporary basis.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railways VDSZSZ on sufficient performance, although just around the Christmas holidays more and more people are travelling by train.
According to previous reports, the BKV is on strike from start-up until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy are putting down work for four hours, and the teachers' union bwz. the Democratic Teachers' Union have called for 2- and 2-8 hour strikes respectively.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike at different times throughout the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which is due from next year.
Claim number three states that the eligible professions will be granted access to the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that VDSZSZ, a member of the League of Trade Unions, did not accept the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the secondary lines and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard established this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary" have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "enhancement of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Gypsies population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this was the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such a dispute, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposition."
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "had seriously damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extremely right-wing groups in Hungary has been constantly on the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several organisations called "national self-defense association" have been founded.
"It is common for these groups to define themselves as civil organizations, while openly boasting about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (catastrophe protection, national defense, order-shouting), citing the inability of the police, the army, or the state itself," they said.
And further: All of this is done according to the method that tries to disguise various political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative, based on the political and party discontent of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association thus serves not only to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration with the courts - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard also represent a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, and some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirming its own anti-Hungary policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - they said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
According to reports, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard were the mass riots of the Roma, which took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU immediately took the events as the occasion for the creation of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organisation is "national protection".
In their opinion, a real "gypsy terror" was noticeable in Bulgaria in the past 17 years, but the state remained indifferent and indifferent - so Political Capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have given way to a fierce debate among the Bulgarian public.
As I have said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they will set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma are also reacting to the threats by organizing their own protection, the Risk Warning Report of Political Capital states.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, at the request of the News Office, said: Risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published and, should risk-changing trends be discernible, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holiday days are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, public holidays are strictly regulated by law, so that the practice of redistributing the working days around the holidays has now become established, but the coming year will give us less such days.
In the EU and in America, too, something else is understood as "celebratory holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and work-free days.
Labour-free days are mostly church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we are also celebrating New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are days without work - the latter alone so that the New Year celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th of March, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the memorial day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the foundation of the state, on 1 May the work is celebrated, on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day postponement" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be completed in the end, is fixed for long years by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants.
Only companies and institutions in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on public holidays, are excluded.
This year, the working order is only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in this country will formally stand still, since most take time compensation for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the specially cancelled holiday.
Next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or the end of the week, so that there will be less redispancies on the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day, so Friday, May 2nd can be a day of rest.
The second re-disposal is related to the holiday on October 23rd: On Saturday, October 18th, you will have to work Friday, October 24th in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be completely marked by the holidays, after everything will be settled and stopped from 24 December, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we don't notice anymore: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The question is simply whether you get used to these minor inconveniences, or if you better face the challenge and try to avoid them deliberately, for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says a colleague.
That it missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by perhaps calling the marketing department and remorsefully confessing that you would have forgotten to align the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before you get involved in embarrassing excuses, you should consider how you can really prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
To borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's hardly anything more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the notebook was still on the desk - this morning it is gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are right to be upset when they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put any envelopes or post-it from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more there, if you really need it.
Talking about colleagues' private lives?
There is no effective means of stopping a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who did what to who?
Where and why?
One should not tie the information (or conjecture) about the private life of the colleagues to everyone's nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and tells us his innermost secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to keep silent like a grave, instead of directing those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of their colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call in the office to report yourself ill with painful headaches, because you are feeling uncomfortable or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, irreplaceable executions, projects with fixed appointments must now be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't mess with colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won't make it to the office the next day, or that something could come in between, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Summing up, giggles, phone calls
We are in the middle of our work, but are we suddenly disturbed by the loud giggling of our colleagues?
Inadvertently listening to a phone call you shouldn't have heard?
One should not bother the colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which one leads over their heads), trampling, constant scolding or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not exactly deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the others' fault?
If a project is not completed on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the guilt of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, do not talk about the chaos in the office or the noisy colleagues!
The best way to admit your mistakes is to apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake or make up for the missing is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training Pants and Slaps: Comfortable for home, but has nothing to lose in the office!
Not even then should you dress so casually, if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
To make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of every morning traffic jam.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The local music scene hasn't spoiled us with high-quality electropop for a long time.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear the new album from Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar squeak is "in" again, the domestic electropop proves: There are new things under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, playing in the band Yonderboi himself, before he started to walk his own way - perhaps because a tavern can't handle two pipers.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merges elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, was only achieved when one approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, became almost the only trendsetter, also marketable in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar, the influences of rock'n'roll - corresponding to the zeitgeist and the trends - stand out.
With these songs, singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", introduced himself at the premiere at Millenáris.
A song from the album even made it to the radio hit - the mr2 Petőfi, which has been broadcasting pop music from early to late, has gradually set the listener with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's fine (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "shift music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but they can also only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
Also a good pop number can arise from an honest motive.
The listener's willingness to accept also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more attentively, because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see more and more coming to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, music does not arise to serve a purpose, but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that is only in the incomprehensible changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I have noticed that if you want to make it right for everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built his career more in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, not to mention trying to interpret this into our music over and over again.
We see ourselves as more of a team player who trusts in the musical presence of the other and lets them unfold.
At the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with Yonderboi's were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took another path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a somewhat more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which is supposed to be a draw horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was meant as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to assemble the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was formed - namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized apately "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls help shape it?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically straight away and frighteningly spontaneous.
I remember I was pretty electrified back then, but it was already the "Divas" needed.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: On the record as well as at the concert one had the impression, however, that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They also stood on the stage in the back.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: That they stood in the back was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting a little about your ego, forgetting who came from and where to go, let's just let these particular wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would like others to also feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In musical creative work actually none at all, there were rather more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove did not want to work for a longer time, but gradually everything joined together, like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts constantly and also now, where I "let go" the album.
At present it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Counterfeit brokers risked billions because of inferiority
Groundless swindler
This is the name given to his former employee Jerome Kerviel by the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came by almost five billion euros because of him.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, and was certainly not incapable of doing so.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in good time.
"He is mentally rather weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who reported him to the police.
But according to Kerviel's statements published by the French media, such as the daily Le Monde, he was a man who had made a profit of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros, especially in the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were already first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would get into trouble.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and was right.
At the end of the year, it had increased its profits to up to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits and goes on to say that he definitely didn't keep anything to himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he falsified documents so he wouldn't get caught.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to get caught?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was content with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position step by step.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already assistant to a realtor and in 2005 he became an independent realtor with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"I already knew during my first conversation in 2005 that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of Allianz, he earned a lot by placing half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew everything, or suspected it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then at the beginning of this year came the big blow.
On a single day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get to him?
He made himself suspicious by taking a vacation.
"I only took four days from last year.
A realtor who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look him in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes, which will enable the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kroner) over the next few years.
This is about half the total that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kroner come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion kroner from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
The most money, about 150 billion, will flow into the development of transport.
The transport program is the largest development program and comprises up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money will increase in line with the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to attract funds for innovative ventures.
The aim is for companies to gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful among the new candidate countries in the previous EU fund money acquisition.
Nicaraguan Court Confirms Twenty Years of Prison for Ex-Presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year prison term for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion kroner) in financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the news agency AP, it is currently unclear whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state will be put behind bars again.
According to Ileana Pérez, the chairman of the Court of Appeals, it will now depend on the prison officials whether Alemán is allowed to serve his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court ruled four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to fund his 2001 campaign.
Budget is due to:
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and that has been adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because it was submitted by Minister Sobotka (of this party), and the ČSSD could not therefore allow itself to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Deputies approved this law, which has traditionally been little respected, but which is of great importance.
That's kind of paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is obscured by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciative subject for the media, and that is why they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past social democratic governments, which the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is legally obligatory, not only pensions, but also social expenditure that the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is budgetary deficits as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to income from taxes, taxes and bank loans, often gave out ill-considered bonds to over-indebt their councillors.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through the mass sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks that they had received from the state in the course of privatisation.
Now this source has already dried up.
Insofar as we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth that the ČSSD has been boasting without ceasing.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments committed even more debt to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge disgrace that is mainly attributable to previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been inflated to a gigantic extent, particularly in recent years.
Although it has been possible to remove some of the senseless populist spending that was adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no postponement of the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, virtually every policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, it will remain nothing but a mere administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that ruling politicians then become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenues into pensions and social spending.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the suppression of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion kroner in 2008 would certainly be superfluous if previous governments had not spent what was only possible in the last ten years.
If we do not want the ruling politicians to become mere administrators, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and charges as we wish to have peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
Thus, more than $100 billion of auctions will reach the currency markets.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the U.S. Fed is sending $40 billion at auction, another 24 making it easy for the European and Swiss Central Banks.
It is the first time after the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to ward off or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote in a report for its customers Bernard Baumohl from the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unserviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of dollars to be lost.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can be done when they decided to do so," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used for lending money between banks, after they failed to do so.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow money from each other, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Reuters agency.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks contributes to the heating up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists’ debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the closing UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet", he said that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies them and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often encounter caricatures of my views."
So now interested ones could read his attitude unscathed.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He was, after all, an academic who was able to understand and assess technical papers, had experience in statistics and was also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptablely burdensome.
Moreover, as someone with experience of totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he regards it as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not opposed to "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for the exchange so that the authorities will be able to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will go to the streets without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, mainly those who no longer want to drive did not change their driving licence.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in the Füherschein exchange, the capital's offices are flooded with applications, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration produces around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver's license.
The issue of a new driver's license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver has to pay 500 kroner.
From January onwards, drivers who do not make the mandatory exchange by the end of the year and who leave without a valid driving licence will face a fine.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2,000 kroner.
The police, however, can also leave it with an admonition in the event of the violation.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may rise to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, even those who do not drive at all can get a penalty imposed by the community.
It was said that he could be threatened with a penalty of even 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry already called on the offices to exercise mildness and impose a maximum penalty of 1000 kroner.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, nobody would be threatened with a thousand crown penalty.
The driving licence was a document in which everyone could decide whether he wanted to own it or not.
It was not an identity card that everyone, a valid one, had to have.
People who don't want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It is sufficient to take him to the appropriate municipal office or send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, drivers have to gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having made a joint cause with the gang of David Berdych, were detained for 13 years and 10 years respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today's verdict, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also indicted in this case, but he is facing the first-instance judgment.
In other trials, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
That's all he can be sentenced to.
In January, a district court found that 19 people were guilty of robbery, and the Higher Regional Court was today discussing the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the charge from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with Berdych, among others, gave criminals information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to evade prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the booty.
The prosecution is about the gang's crimes from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious injuries, but also acts of impoverishment and illicit possession of arms.
In house searches the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser scope and a machine gun.
The gang has, according to the prosecution, enriched itself with their robberies by many millions of crowns.
Except for nearly 20 men in this trial, Berdych courts and a number of others recognized as guilty of further robberies.
More men from Berdych's area have to answer for themselves in another trial, other cases have not yet been brought to court.
The main negotiations have so far escaped Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and are awaiting the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children swapped - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million kroner compensation from the hospital in Třebíč plus legal expenses.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore not at all in agreement with Velebas' proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dostál said after today's hearing.
"But in order to be able to form an opinion on this counterproposal, we need the expert opinion that the other side had drawn up.
We'll find out if it's meaningful at all.
We insist, however, that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all together," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 kroner for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted one million crowns for each month that they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in varying degrees of strength and depth.
The men were better at coping with the stress situation, even if they were facing accusations that they could have prevented the newborns from getting confused.
The women, on the other hand, cope worse with the aftermath of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening now, Veleba summed up the content.
On 9 December last year Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity clinic in Třebíč.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the District Governor of the Vysočina (Bohemian-Moravian Height) handed over to each family 100000 kroner as a replacement for expenses incurred by the fault of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured.
In case of doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply to the institution for assistance.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low amounts of compensation to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and ranged from hundreds of thousands to millions in exceptional cases.
Polívka came around his kingdom Walachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the trademark "Kingdom of Wallachia".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor.
Polívka did not attend the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The issue is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in Bolek Polívka's popularity," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
They all introduced themselves to this actor and comedian in the words "Walachian Kingdom".
The same opinion is expressed by Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money raising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is dispute over money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to get parasitic about our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that was not at that time connected with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš thought of spending Walachian passports.
From an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabiš followed the establishment of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka made public in the show "Manege" for his business intentions.
"Polívka's popularity certainly helped the project of the Wallachian kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had devoted themselves intensively to him.
The cooperation of today's divided parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav I Elected to Saint Nimmerlein's Day".
At the suggestion of Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková, the leading role was taken as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed the lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court dismissed today.
The battle prepared by Harabiš could bring clarity to the dispute and bring half a princess to the throne.
A new king was to emerge from this.
He didn't want to give up details and an appointment.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be like the royal parade in Walachia.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also register quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages dwindle
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear shift, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The combination with the designation SW is still a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
For example, when I tested the classic 207 Hatchback, I had to complain about the too little headroom on the back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly continue
I'm just going through the interior for a little while, not to repeat myself too much.
It is a quite successful design, where I have objections only because of the poor middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and over are the times when we might complain about too short seats or head restraints.
Sideholds have also improved significantly compared to 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
The combination also eliminates the aforementioned lack of headroom.
Suitcase in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the cargo space.
I have to describe it (also because of the folding back window) as very good loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot is left behind by clearly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a foreign holiday or when inviting a stroller.
But in order to highlight the positives, I have to mention the very flat cargo space or the very low loading edge after the rear seats have been folded over.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that's what a 1600-cubic engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and moves away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes looks like his exhaust is clogged with a rag, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
However, we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 kroner is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car again beats with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper release, electric window lifters at the back and...
Thus, the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but put together the extra equipment of a Fabia and you'll arrive at a very similar amount.
So the only decision left is which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools does not succeed
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, causing fears among locals about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between the locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment, and brawls among students have spread to the relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself by insulting her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack on a Slovak immigrant by two underage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed a bushhouse and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students from The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming more and more tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks came here looking for work.
Some 30000 Slovak pupils are therefore attending British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will come true if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palm trees and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will find this in abundant measure.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
One of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, had it built, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (especially during prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
==References====External links==
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rises grew, and cars crossed the broad boulevards, which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as desired.
And the cult cars of the fifties are still driving around in Havana today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have already fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Havana, in particular its oldest part, may have been heavily run down, nowhere can you find as many wonderful colonial sights in the vicinity as just here.
Other places are being cleaned out, such as Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, the green light has been given for this development.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts rail lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
Most of Cuba's visitors do not miss out on the most important places.
So you no longer have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
Just to mention that there is a museum in the already mentioned estate of Hemingways, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise up steeply from the bottom of the valley, in their cavities fertile soil accumulated, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her the trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied itself in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road that would have connected the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation helped to keep it unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the "Valley of Sugar Factorys".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after the darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
Some people call this town the most beautiful of the island in eastern Cuba.
Certainly this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo have to overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its world heritage directory thanks to the untouched nature there.
There is the best chocolate made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
The coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, all this could be written on many sides.
Yes, as they say, look better with your own eyes.
Ally in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
NATO should, according to Defence Minister Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not proceed according to their ideas, on this in Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed.
In addition to growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defence minister Robert Gates, called on NATO units to become more active, Britain sees the priority as strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to begin their own economic and security development," says the British defence minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of Afghan insurgents has reached its highest level in five years.
The number of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand by even sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," Gates said.
Today, the Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, said the same thing.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of Reuters Agency, concluding three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive?
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best in recent months.
For example, Germany was criticized for passiveness.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid "Sun" called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan non-stuer unmasked: the Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bildzeitung went on to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Public debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a public debt of 84000 kroner.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to commit 159.2 billion Konen this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of government budgetary policy.
Public debt in the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
As a result, the first nine months of this year saw an increase of 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its state debt figures from early October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84000 kroner.
Over the past year, the state has been in debt by more than 111 billion kroner.
"Until now it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of one trillion kroner until 2009.
Next year, debt should range between 900 billion and one trillion kroner," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the iHNed.cz server.
Vladimír Pikora, Next Finance analyst, also sees it as similar: "We could exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, this could take until 2010.
But I don't expect such a change," he remarked.
Debt growth
The government debt stems from the debt of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The sovereign debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has now risen to 719,4 billion kroner this year.
The government's foreign debt has now risen by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that the increase is mainly in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," said Pikora, commenting on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion kroner this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the improved development of government budgetary policy.
This amount comes mainly from the government budget deficit, which is apparently to reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum budget for the Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten-billion reserve to pay pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and instalments for loans to the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was brought to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan was sentenced to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British woman was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be flogged.
After having complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School in Khartoum, was picked up at home on Sunday and, according to Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, was accused of insulting Islam.
In fact, this matter begins in September when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed , reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but especially a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not carry a shield with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew them well, and that she would never have done anything that could put her close to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks about religion in class.
Consider that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given second name in Great Britain, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is regarded as a kind of homage to the Prophet (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo concluded a sixth and final discussion meeting in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning, without overcoming their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace is at stake in the region, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their obligations to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, suggesting that there are indeed clear tensions.
End of placements on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which unite the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiation meeting since the Troika received a mandate from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains an advocate of a negotiated solution, a friendly solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with future.
Pristina is ready to proclaim this unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in their favor.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the President of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations of last chance have been conducted since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, shared his regrets.
He added, however, that the plan proposed by Belgrade for the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence by the province.
Belgrade believes that it particularly favours a "domino effect" in a region that is so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
Kosovo's Parliament will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
The journalists were told by Fatmir Sejdiu that Kosovo's parliament would have the last word on status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking population would proceed in consultation with the Western countries.
Bush Unlocks an Agreement Between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference held in Annapolis, Maryland on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the Roadmap for Peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately sought a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term covers the three serious problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians are mainly about: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the wake of the 1948 conflict in the present state of Israel.
After the President of the United States, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and provide a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he undertook that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli that exist side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks at the roots of the conflict and at its central points of view, the Saudi Arabian prince writes in his interview with the Arabic-language daily newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors face each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Police Disciplinary Authority (IGPN), a police car drove to Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m. on Rue Louise-Michel.
He had no use, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a spokesman of the police.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, without registration, so not approved for public road traffic (see below), came, driven by two young people without helmet, at very high speed.
A police officer continued to explain that the left side of the police car was rammed after it had disregarded its driveway from the right.
The alcohol control carried out in the vehicle passengers is much negative.
The condition of the car (damaged fender, splintered windshield, torn-off bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the ICPN with an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main district administration for public security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she was excluding the police from being responsible for investigating the ICPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely, that this small motorcycle came relatively quickly to their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of grooves, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained tangled up until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were examined yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel there was a rumor that the police had left the scene very quickly, without helping the two young people.
Although the ICPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious errors in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, for which further investigations are necessary, and in which one must proceed very carefully.
Libération met an eyewitness of these moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed police officer limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth on the phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the events and, it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident in the car.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue workers arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces did not help the young people.
First aid has been given to these young people.
The fire department came in immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor for her part stressed.
In Pakistan the tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police crushed the first demonstrations since two days earlier General Musharraf declared the emergency state.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the emergency measures were injured by the tear gas grenades used by the police there.
Those then threw stones at the police with which they injured them.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them would have been arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, the attorneys of the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositionists, human rights advocates and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations had taken place in Multan (Mitte) and Peshawar (Northeast).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement received the support of religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken out against the emergency, and to those who had taken an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a stand on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of The News said.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to surrender command of the army and become a civilian president no longer applies since the invocation of the emergency, declared Monday the vice minister for information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would surrender his military uniform by November 15th, the date on which his first term as president ended.
The Vice-Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the country’s persistent rumors that President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception, such as the pill or the spiral, still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age using the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless made it possible to better control fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned today.
With one of five couples even calculated accurately for the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools made by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a large cylindrical part that will soon take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-tonne module for generating electricity via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew set about restructuring the solar panels of the module, with a span of 76 metres.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the Discovery space shuttle for a check-up and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30 meter long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was therefore selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After he had carefully examined the damage, he severed the faulty cable and attached a kind of rail to the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who stayed near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey bat, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station conceived and fabricated.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the Discovery space shuttle, expected to return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Aviation and Defense Group announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to counter the A400M backlog, the EADS stock is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007 regarding the residues caused by the slow development of the engine of the A400M, which delay the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007, when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month lag.
As a reminder, the business performance of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to enumerate the ballot boxes: the mass of Russians will opt for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the leading candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kreml party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything go through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to deliver a new attack on the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have lost their way.
It denounces an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there have never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-Chess World Champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstration, according to his lawyer's continued ban on visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much further questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The term of office yesterday announced the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party United Russia, which will choose government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not master of their fate, writes sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St Petersburg goes even further back: bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized five centuries to Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin re-established the model of a paternalist state, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians freely renounce the personal responsibility they have shown for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
What's the point of thinking long?
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why think long?
Those in power aren't so bad, why replace them?
A Hard Memory
After being kept confidential for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located in Bad Arolsen for a total length of 27 km, have not yet been consulted, except with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. a request from a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the eleven states responsible for managing them, including Germany, France, Israel and the USA, agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Hot information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of forced laborers, Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or the mental obstruction of some deportation victims.
The inmates' lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest, thus paving the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen still handle tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One must not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, explained Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Center for Antisemitism of the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, trade between India and Europe is already reaching EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
Last April, EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), with trade between India and Europe already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans , confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten products most exported from India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants trade goods worth EUR 47 billion annually and services worth EUR 10 billion, this week Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission’s delegation in New Delhi, said, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India will meet on Friday at their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso will be present.

The Bank of England notes the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about curbing the current recurring concern about credit terms and announced an offer of £10 billion with a base interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, it states in a communication.
The Bank further explains that on 6 December, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation at 12.15 GMT, at the property tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE has circulated liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the interest rates of the inter-Bänkian loans, which vary from day to day, with their basic interest rate.
On Wednesday, the variable rate of interest from day to day was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate has fluctuated to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with fines that the banks had prevented from using.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound exchange rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS' proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which is a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, the majority of which were 50% on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIP, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some violent exchanges of views between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present all of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances that had been examined last week by the Assamblee.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America, told Charlie Jones of C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which now accommodates up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever attended, says that his company and Melvin Benn's work side by side to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have selected Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We held negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in 2005 at Grand Park Chicago, after it emerged in 2002 together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of festival.
The two events were able to generate $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax returns in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours is more likely to take place on urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is, in one way or another, to merge these two concepts in order to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is delighted to take on the burden of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to record a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It's not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the Terminator stands against it.
These lock attempts are among the delegates' tasks.
A politically "hot mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where to go.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the first priority at the moment is to advance the cinema there.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the west coast, although Sundance, the one of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing an end-year rally? Disagreement with experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the financial statements on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands with regard to the upcoming final year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make reliable forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock exchange usually goes hand in hand with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially when serious tensions determine the current market situation
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. These invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of safe equity funds, which is severely affected by the upside trend towards high-income assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock market will tend to have a more lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, mainly because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve, an uncertainty due mainly to the rise in crude oil prices and the risk of inflation rising.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the Sales Department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4 % since its highest mark on 8 November of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional grant of the pension fund at that time each year.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop slightly differently, mainly because of the final year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore directly after the bridge day to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the market assessments to date are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a possible deviation from the index values in the near future, the extent of which depended on the consequences of the US mortgage crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the choice of values to push the Ibex towards new maximums.
Solana of Intermoney affirms that this year is the turn of the great values.
Among the value-winners, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the appropriate time.
Meanwhile Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases in connection with the banking and industrial sector will be accompanied.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, according to the expert.
With regard to the increased consumption behaviour during the Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine the market situation in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only seen declining price trends in two cases.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 caught up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed an increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has been increasing by 8.36%) and also a final year rally will show up.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically powerful regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches weekdays to 20.30h and to start Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The Bank's ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement where 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for this on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening times, will depend on the experience of Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular pursues with her project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their location, can capture the shopping customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will reorganise the premises of those branches that are already located in business zones and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the expansion of opening hours is linked to a new interior design of the stores, which is characterized by a more contemporary, colourful design.
The relevant bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require major investments, but is accompanied by an increased recruitment of staff, since a branch now needed no more six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We don't want to compete for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally reached an agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private channel Telecinco doubles its market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The transmitter he managed had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that is exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they did not fall too low.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, goodwill now reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of capital (52%) and Vocento holding only 13%.
Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, resulting in a market value of 2,193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies is increasing; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that they are two similar companies , according to Vasile.
The question still seems uncertain to what extent we can actually act on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first television channel this year to generate more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues, as stated by Guiseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising income by 3.6% compared to the 964,4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the television business increased by only 0.7% (630.4 million).
The analysts see the main factor for the better performance of Telecinco in comparison with the high payout ratio that the company was able to show up to this point in time: in 2006 the company led by Alejandro Echevarría initiated a 100 percent dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as its parent company, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more so far.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing certain trends in losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and for 2009 by 7%.
This was the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the forecast profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
Three options.
1.
Ibersecuritys: relies on its high effective yield and sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: As a result of the multiple incentives and the prosperous market, Telecinco (buying) measures a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (keep).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends reducing expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which ended its session today with the Congress resolution in the Senate on the amendments to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congressmen and senate members, who in their negotiations and votes had the aim of establishing the best possible regulation, which guarantees the security of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities, in order to guarantee a generally efficient market situation.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, the MIFID, which is redefining the Investment Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the right of control of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows financial advisory services to be offered to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consulting companies which are affiliated with investment and brokerage companies in securities.
It also increases the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, adding to the regulated circulation markets the multilateral systems of the securities business and the systems for the internationalisation of trading orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the focus of their company profile, the confrontation and forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the control task of CNMV.
The Congressional Economic Commission subsequently made further changes, with the decision that the securities bond must now be regarded as complex financing due to its high degree of risk to the investor, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the areas of work of qualified economists was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation was adopted which restricted the areas of work reserved for economists.
The Senate, for its part, defined new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator, who works on behalf of third parties, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for customer acquisition at the same time several investment companies.
The harmonised index of consumer prices (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare location and quality with US products through the disclosure of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared early, using the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the early indicator would only serve as a benchmark and therefore would not have to be consistent with the final result announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Head of State and Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development and at the same time assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the congress building that even if the current figure is not good, the inflation differential between Spain and the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Economic and Finance Minister announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock’s assets have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the UK central bank for emergency loans due to the crisis in mid-September last year, and they now amount to only £12,000 million (equivalent to £16,800 million).
At that time, the bank's assets amounted to £25,000 million in record terms, a sum that has fallen considerably within two and a half months due to the loss of trust among customers, and also despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe until the end of the crisis will continue to decline.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, will have to contribute about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be made up of investments over the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, who is known for his eye-catching advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to channel £50,000 million (approximately €70 million) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the municipality of Murcia, Totano (Partido Popular), due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales last May, currently a member of the Popular Party and then chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, and, according to information from the Cadena SER radio station, could be the original mastermind of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Town Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular , and therefore privileged MP Juan Morales, was arrested when leaving his client's residence on the basis of important incriminating documents that are supposed to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on Morales' alleged order payments to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban development contract in which the development of a 200 hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
The former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory by the Socialists, to take over the office of Congress President.
José Blanco, the organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced it in the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party's headquarters.
In the view of the Heads of Government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the upcoming elections, the politician from Mancha would appear to be running as chairman of the Congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of the Congress, who announced last November 15 that he would stop taking part in the next general elections, end his career in public politics and instead work for climate protection in the university sector.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the government had continuously pressed for his return to political events.
He also pointed out that, as in the case of the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to withhold from the citizens who would take over the post of Congress President in the event of an election victory, and called this an act of transparency.
If he should actually take up office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a house of respect, not insulting or screaming, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time, the impression is that the only place where we cannot talk calmly and calmly in Madrid is the Congress; so once the president of the government was interrupted in the Senate up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and his good work and suggested that he did not want to appear to have already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate involves both the sceptics of climate change and those who place a social and political debate at the forefront in this regard, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts it in a need for explanation regarding the action, or non-action, of its government, which has played a decisive role in ensuring that Spain is at the top of the EU's list of countries that have least complied with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are responsible for the failure to comply with the guidelines, to which sectors this is due, and why did his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, not stop this development.
Moreover, he is now forced to explain to Spanish citizens the measures he intends to take to combat climate change without further ado.
Which companies will be affected by this, which behaviour of the citizens should be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures must be carried out and which economic consequences result from it.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for saving the planet.
However, there has and will be no such statements in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and paying.
Because the measures that can be implemented in real terms against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous to Zapatero by electoral strategy that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty slogans without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of decorating the meetings and inspiring others with his meekness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or that we can only refresh ourselves with one compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of Totana, a town belonging to Murcia, popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur were taken into custody because of the alleged suspicion of urban-planning violations, according to investigative circles today.
The city councilman was arrested at his place of residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he remains until now, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the searches already carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land for urban projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria should be remodelled, which would build 4,000 homes on the property after the local administration had granted illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subjected to an investigation initiated and conducted by the First Court of Totonas.
The first six arrested have been brought before the judge today.
According to investigation circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales is also being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend resident in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the Vigo-born lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company acts as a sub-group of Nuaria and is said to have received the bribe.
The investigation is carried out by the municipal authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out 11 further searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests taking place in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming business, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which it had to rebuild. The aim was to realize a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term book of the month and instead try to invent a price name of another name with appropriate competencies.
I already have a suggestion.
Guys, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the head of the PISA study), which takes a stand on the note published in the same newspaper, on 18 November; coincidentally on the day in which the publication contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school graduate, who quoted Plato's and Nietzsche's works in his news.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on the teachers to take a more critical position vis-à-vis Plato and suggested that Plato's teaching be removed from the lower-level curriculum for philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which was concerned with six months of imprisonment.
But if you rob a music business under a value of 400 euros again, this is only a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than with a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than with a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebellious conflict involves a prison term of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered to be less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, the authorization of which has not taken place by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has screwed up his demands quite a bit.

My family doctor presents me with one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was carried out using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the science journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were correct with their response and thus received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, brain activity was also increased.
I am not quite sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been inexorably searching for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is in the Procuratorate of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and laughing eye, as the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - namely the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be at large.
Their names are on the list of the Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as the model for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that, with the speed of a political thriller, follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in their efforts to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which again depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of drawing up the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear about what we're dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which shall stipulate that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to submit the corresponding severance payment in the event of a claim.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance, which consists of several factors, including age, gender, time of drawing up the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that if there is a higher risk of accidents, higher contributions will also be payable.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women have to pay less contributions, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the firm's conviction, they tend to have fewer accidents than single persons.
The benefits attributed to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In drawing up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that suits his personal needs most.
We now list at this point the most important points that should be considered when choosing an insurance policy in order to be able to make not only a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
Under 25-year-olds face numerous obstacles to the choice of low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and a young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to take out comprehensive insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a comprehensive with excess, so that the services of a comprehensive insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer has to pay part of the amount incurred by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, main representative of Spain at First Europa, a brokerage company for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused to his own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is up to you to lower the insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate with the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the above rates.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its revenues.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most appropriate to opt for a comprehensive insurance with a deductible.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, either in the event of an accident or at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been dropped.
Nevertheless, for a married customer who has no children, it is advisable to take out comprehensive insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the corresponding person permits it.
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children are considered to have the lowest accident rate, and accordingly their contributions are also low.
In this case, a comprehensive insurance with a deductible (with an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In the case that one has received a high credit, an extended insurance, which starts only for the third year of the vehicle, is recommended.
They are more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power which allows them to pay a higher contribution, notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners it is advisable to take out a comprehensive insurance with a deductible (with an amount of 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only uses with a sufficiently high credit.
In the end, it is important to note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it has high costs, which require a thorough selection, which corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes for the eighth finale in Milan
Milan FC and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point they lack to reach their respective goals before the final of the Championsleague preliminary round next Tuesday in San Siro. Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the latter decides on their participation with the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs another one to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D games will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan FC will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where it will fight for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished in front of all others and the draw in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would be in the case of a victory group first and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even defeat Shakhtar in a slump to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because the Ukrainians are entitled to participate at nine points tie; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milanese will try to spoil the Scots the evening. They hope again to reach the eighth final of the remodeled Championsleague for the second time in a row, after being defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the postseason (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the final.
While Shakhtar FC is waiting for Rossoneri to win, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both the achievement of the eighth final and their membership in UEFA depend on their victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could win third place with a win and thus play in the UEFA despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In Vancouver, Canada, the Spice Girls launched their first tour after the band broke up in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before their concert at GM Place de Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people witnessed the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video of the band's history, which caused a sensation at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two other new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which is released in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the crowds that made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Schow, Victoria Beckham said that the British star didn't see our wardrobe once, and that's why I'm really excited about what he's going to think of the performance.
Sporty Spice , whose departure from the group in 1998 resulted in the dissolution of the group two years later due to internal disagreements, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings for the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not, so I'm glad to have made that decision, Chisholm said about the breakup of the band that had led her nine years ago.
The singer also said that the quarrels were eliminated and that they all now love each other very much.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special aircraft operated by Virgin Airlines.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was welcomed by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on the 23rd of December.
New fears about gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is raging between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia's gas exports to the European Union (EU) are directed through Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be charged more, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," said Anatoli Kinakh, Ukraine's Minister of Economy, Reuters.
"The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drove prices up sharply.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve controls of criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought to the Glasgow airport in June in connection with the attack.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service did not have precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving an off-road vehicle through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October and was charged with the alleged car bomb attack in Britain.
It is expected that the Public Health Service will carry out checks prior to hiring foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines from the criminal record collection, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these controls in some personnel records, they were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines to a high degree before hiring, but added: "Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations prior to the recruitment of potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report states that current pre-employment tests at NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards of directors have problems identifying those employees who are on leave indefinitely.
The investigation also found that established control procedures were largely complied with by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passports, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines on pre-employment controls for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "It was my concern to carry out this work in the light of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on control investigations prior to the recruitment of all staff, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned for next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography of the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has received five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including for the best film.
Awards were also given to leading actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded the Best Actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing British film to the world public.
The prizes were presented in a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order are to be found - was shot for only 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has awarded two prizes to Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best director's debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the award for the best documentary film.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Niggy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets in.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect facilities after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the arrested were part of a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the detainees were planning to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis striving for Iraq to join forces with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-backed Shia Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias see many clergymen in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a huge effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior told state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims supporting violence against Muslims who are branded as infidels and apostates.
Among the arrested were also 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could give a glimpse of the future of the Earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on an orbit show that the planet resembles an averted twin of the Earth even more than it was previously aware of.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to the Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have had conditions very similar to those on earth and could have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unabated carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotational pace, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which examined the planet for one year, offer a sobering view of how the earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said, "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
One kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally agreed to face a debate on YouTube where ordinary voters record and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican party, which will start next year's elections.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate, who chose the candidate to show YouTube clips.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest one devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The television company noticed tops of approval when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed himself forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the call that he was pliable about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two were particularly dissenting as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, succeeded in following up on this issue.
Neither of the two men has serious chances of being nominated, but they both stay in the race, perhaps because they hit immigration spauke sooner and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: stronger borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This theme, along with fears about poisonous toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible was his preferred book, he might not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, contrary to all expectations, first place in a recent survey in Iowa, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was urged to support them, Jesus laughed at them and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraiser successes and his assaults in Wednesday's debate.
These two have been shot up from nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about America's greatness and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No noble titles seem to have been sold, no politicians paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has concealed donations for the British ruling Labour Party over more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the contested Gordon Brown would have managed well.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister withdrew from the demand for an election, in a stupid way insulting the intelligence of the British, claiming that opinion polls did not influence this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly perceptive chairman of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once feared Brown of Stalin has evolved into Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to change tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The tax loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative baffles.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: to be ministers of the armed forces, they claimed, is a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and their former Head of Implementation) has already resigned.
None of this means Brown is irrevocably heading off the road.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point by which they find it impossible to govern.
People do not like or trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he will not even have to be there for long, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to leak; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are related to decisions taken by Brown as Chancellor of the Treasury Department.
And even if it wasn't directly involved in Blair's mishap - as with the long "money for noble title" investigation of political party financing - voters may assume it was him.
Still, Brown's situation isn't as bad as it looks
The misdeeds are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely swindled.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's, of course, Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new fuss about political donations is a good example.
Abraham’s garboesque, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be so, but he was not entitled to decide.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial collector, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, even though most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping for a known instrument, led to a committee of inquiry on the subject - to make the measure full, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, "the lessons to be drawn from" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a sweeping reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party mate like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; they have two years to win back voters; and the only way to achieve victory is through incontestable righteousness and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis affecting America's credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that back fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America's real estate market is hurting, predators are targeting the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of infection from underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both derecognition and default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are either not recoverable or more than 30 days late.
Last month, HSBC announced that it had withdrawn a $1.4 billion fee collection from its US consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and delays are still low.
According to Moody, the third quarter default rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn accounted for a large proportion of credit card losses; the number of applications (and hence default fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates showing how much of its debt consumers pay off every month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the output volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: it is more likely that consumers will take credit card debt, now that home loans dry out.
However, card issuers look at the flow of money rather than at capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be beneficial for card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates fall when real estate is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important than repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexible than lenders to the stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and reassess the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and credit cuts push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron
Three British bankers who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former Chief Financial Officer of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their requests to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications to purportedly conspire with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK in the course of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the aim of a government investigation into Enron's decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claim that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron's partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron schemes that helped tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the Bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely argued to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7,3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others anticipated $12,2 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to conspiracy on two counts for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison term in the Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and a month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the nation, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of bookkeeping tricks could no longer conceal billions of debt or make faltering enterprises appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges became null and void after he passed away last year for heart disease.
Not at the very bottom in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least $54 million.
But that's change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it's for a private family or a business president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the millionaires exhibition, a four-day orgy of consumption on display, held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly received Russians in everything, from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-covered car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"This is a nice car, but it's change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems so flooded with money like Dallas during its heyday.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went in droves to Europe where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world's most open-minded financiers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, attracted to share ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who own a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a panel of experts here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived under the subsistence limit.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they travel through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked for the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a Red Carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to focus primarily on the new realms, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to spend several hours in traffic jams to visit a trainy warehouse that shamelessly placed Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, customized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears side by side.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized image of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climpers."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-lane logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requests, said he had sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are identical to linked chain arm tires, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-off.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants to have ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in real estate prices here.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich in a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red telephone booths filled with mountains of false million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed out 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the millionaires fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around the piles of money, mobile phone photos while leaning back in the middle of the spare wealth, letting friends snap, or just plugging in a few million.
"Look, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Broken operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop at the white Cape Cod two doors further down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's coroner's van approaching," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to find out if she died because of a procedure conducted by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon that the police didn't identify, and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, the results of which could not be available for weeks, will help to resolve a mysterious death that has sent a grief by the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard working and persistent," Mr. McCarthy said about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Ms. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the ground.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have not communicated much about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a withered rose shrub stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him to find his way through provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that'," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates lead to the rise in world stock markets
The stocks jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rate cuts were strengthened by appeased comments by the vice-chairman of the US Central Bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, Ben Bernanke's number two chairman of the Central Bank, said that policy had to react "flexiblely and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down distressing markets, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence persisted, it would increase the possibility of further tightening of financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is willing to intervene and stabilise credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The remarks also helped to calm Wall Street, given further bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US real estate reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost reduction measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage lending sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand from an auction of three-month guarantees from the European Central Bank granted to the European Commercial Banks was lent at a considerable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and feed further capital into the money markets in London increased as the credit tensions saw the three-month Libor rates for lending between UK banks rise to their highest at 6.59% since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who's gonna beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, at least under this special title, is here to help the head coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan decide on it, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling up with applications for national voters' offices, if not for part-time ones.
Whoever does not get the sixth bat position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to nail down exactly what enables a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in cricket, where selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may perhaps be asked of another area, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or sink.
Of course, figures have a major impact on decisions, but they have opportunities to do so.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a racquet must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the pickers is more complicated.
There were many who were better than, for example, James Anderson last season, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and how the wind is panting into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still fighting to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after another discussion in the course of today's Asgiriya Stadium web session.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22 years, speaks and an excellent balance against turned-on bullets.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the pickers as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his punch that was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has shovels of joie de vivre.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently overturned a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and say with enthusiasm: "Did you see that?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he is tilting his middle tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that maybe Shah won't stand well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he's the one who's going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas ran out, and others who hoped the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, in relation to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to put back at this point in time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he was unable to renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime did not allow him to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia supported by the United States helped drive Al-Qaeda out of its bastion in the west of the capital and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his house in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand grenade attack after he had called on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He was coming back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaeda militias in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the US troops increased and by the growth of local "groups affected citizens" who armedly and in cooperation with the American military defend their neighbourhoods.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and dwindling funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed general suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria, and the government urged the Iraqis to stop giving visas to force them to return to Iraq," said Sunni retiree.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shiite homes and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will revive sectarian tensions and conflict will occur.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and shines even with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarland countries have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I declared yesterday for the 50th time to a non-aarlander that we are not French" - this slogan posters the smallest federal state self-ironic for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is ranked fifth in the education monitor of the Cologne Institute of German Economy (IW).
For example, the universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries from a tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
But also the state children bring the Saarland in above-average number to the universities - many of them without a degree at the Gymnasium.
"The vocational education system is used in Saarland," says Axel Pluennecke, education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their qualifications at a vocational school, which means that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are also comparatively strongly developed.
In terms of population, dual study programmes are the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms in the general schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced national comparative tests.
For children to start learning earlier, the last daycare year is free of charge - a model that is now also copied by other federal states.
Whether the performance of the pupils will improve sustainably will only show future comparative studies.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of at-risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians count better.
And as far as the Saarland is concerned, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured with Pisa - otherwise one could score points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbours is compulsory at high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez changes the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez has the timepieces turned back in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joker.
According to the Venezuelan Official Journal, according to a new law, clocks are set at world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The US-hostile Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States had imposed on the world the division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the termination of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is pushing forward with a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was the decision by Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia concerning the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spitted Venezuela in the face" with his decision, had criticized Chávez on Sunday.
Chávez is also popular in Spain.
A new cell phone ringtone is causing a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed at the recent Ibero-American summit by the constant interludes of the left-wing populist and who had driven him over his mouth.
Germans Threatens 2007 Wage Minus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to face a real loss of wages this year.
Experts mentioned a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect less in real terms in the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to modest wage developments, the increase in VAT and the drop in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Image" newspaper.
New burdens could also be imposed on employees in the case of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was right and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed to ask the federal government for loans or subsidies, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it became known that the price explosion in food and petroleum products pushed the inflation rate to the highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices on the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoots at an altitude of about 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppe Theory", lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the devil's twin of the earth, but it's a twin," Russel said.
The fundamental question of the Esa mission is why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken on such a completely different development.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the nineties no probe was on the road specifically for the exploration of this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighbour planet with Earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa informs.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the terrestrial winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second largest planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the Sun in just under 225 days.
But he turns much slower around himself: A day of Venus lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly resembles the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained on earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for their attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signalled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but took Merkel's protection from the accusation that she was pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China also knows that," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from within the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the Union's "show window policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only unloaded the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to the SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries.
China's head of government, Wen Jiabao, has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lama's reception as a mistake.
China rejects the official reception of the Tibetan religious leader by European politicians, Wen Jiabao affirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against riots like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots as in France.
Everything had to be done to ensure that social discontent in Germany did not take place in violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior called for.
Barricades were burning, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We have to ensure that social explosives are not built up in us as well and that they are unleashed in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the Hanover-based "New Press".
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal, state and local authorities were already working hard to address problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this already shows first successes."
However, it was too early for a clear warning.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, youths had fought heavy street battles with the police over the past nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings burned.
However, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the German government.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany was not as explosive as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people with a migrant background under 25 years of age was "higher than average".
In particular, more training places had to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany there is more "social control in families" than in France.
Many youths with a migrant background also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned, "But we still have to be careful."
He said that young people should be given "the opportunity to participate in work and training quickly".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet during the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in action, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the day before, a team of around 1000 security forces has been providing peace and quiet.
The police will go through as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
In the night of Tuesday, around 80 policemen were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots were inflamed by a traffic accident that killed two youths on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The Chancellor's unrealistic appearance documents that the content of the coalition is at the end - and that nothing more can be expected of her herself.
Which country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After her dismal appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wrightful and low in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that would have to be ruled by her at last.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is focusing too much on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence.
This is provincial, she said, and showed that she does not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag it has clearly documented for all how much their accusation is true.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a retired politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in the approximates even there.
Example of climate protection: She praises the decisions of Heiligendamm unabated, but does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-praise - so much immodesty would have failed the CDU boss two years ago.
Now she clings to the phrase that the upswing is coming with the people.
In doing so, she is damaging her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of talking the world nicely.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are marginal.
Child poverty and the concerns of the low earners?
She's got a few extra sets for it.
It is significant how often it promises to be when it comes to the child supplement.
Merkel needs three attempts to bring out a semi-straight sentence.
It stumbles like a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are giving themselves a hard punch exchange - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates discharges itself on the first topic.
He had made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants," accused Mitt Romney of his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This in turn counters with serious accusations: "I would say his own house was a port for illegals", replies Giuliani and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates are blowing the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have sent via YouTube are hardly more than a keyword.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have allowed Hitler to come to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is strongly read by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated as torture.
However, the reactions of the audience in the hall in St. Petersburg in Florida show that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected, the Auditorium applauds.
Once again, it shows where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, gnawing and making a plea to the base and television audience that he was still one of the pro-abortionists in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, becomes ensnared when he is asked about his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in civilian for the first time
The day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his post as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby bowing to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as the civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his swearing, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will abolish the state of emergency and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him weighted lawyers following the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of northern Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies plays again: the three band members of Harmonia performed their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival a recording from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The planned sensation then takes place in the form of three set gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of them, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius enthroned in a white shirt at the age of 63 in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes noises, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally blends into a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
But one can reveal here: Targeted inquiries revealed that the name was shimmering through collective pop memory, but not so lasting as to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should not the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially since what misleadingly means Krautrock was always more valid in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for life's work to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003, German pop faces were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation, the surprise knew no limits.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy at concerts.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in a foreign country is one thing.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmony, because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a much less effective power than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played under the promising name Cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler.
At first they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out with Kraftwerk and then gained a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, the perhaps most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973 Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as urban refugees.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
More like a pointy artist.
Supposedly, there was also a pennant of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing association and a name for art.
Some of it was held by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For as calm and modest the music sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
The gathering of rice was not only for the purpose of self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record set of almost 50 people, as someone thinks they will be able to escape.
At that time Rother wanted to promote harmony and practice occasionally.
An immoral demand for Roedelius and Moebius.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flamming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since then than it ever was Harmonia.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of cultivating Krautrock as its own German contribution to live music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidised, within the framework of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is here, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire range of influences of Krautrock on the following pop music.
Harmonia fills in the blank of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's sentence floats with the weirdest sounds in the hall: "The only true music, it owns the future."
There are pictures showing the producer with harmonia in the Bauernstube.
The Legend Formation serves projections of further black and white photos of confused wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by attaching microphones to the organ and drums, in order to extract unheard-of sounds from the instruments via self-made effects.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tech-in-depth tinkerers.
The choir of the house doesn't change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, sound clouds are heard and heard and sung in a beautiful place with Emphase "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought after in blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (powerhouse) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Anyone who calls "'68!" here is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is not going to let it get out of control even now.
Even the most obvious thing is thoroughly reconsidered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of your nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mörderischer Frieden" two films deal with the Balkan War.
But both don't convince.
Either the concepts put too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, there of all places, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nice-negligible roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism drove one to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes the hunted one" (Why do movie titles have to be as long and confused as locomotive driver tariff agreements?).
He delivers a wonderfully winking portrayal: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have been if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long been behind his very best times, but who has preserved considerable remains of his former charm even as a ruin-like monument to his decline.
But despite this trump card, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Mörderischer Frieden", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar snipers, and one of them suddenly falls in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that the Serbs are not represented here as the sole root of all evil, the television flat film is all too quickly lost in ball and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie before.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian super war criminal "The Fox" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and another screenwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military cannot do and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the run-down cynic with his heart as he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script also has to make a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the drain if the reporters manage within the last five minutes in the time-lapse process what Nato, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not managed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague is to be called on for crimes against cinema logic.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they are supposed to agree here for once) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the good things and the bad things are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "I see the swollen forehead veins compassionately, indicating: how exhausting it is to be evil."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have just those swell heads, but they indicate how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently in this newspaper it has been reported that all Iraq movies were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always, when a star roams the world's hot spots or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out of it.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
It had to be decades before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket", which are now regarded as classics, were by no means unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on equal two screens, too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the carelessness they need to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not being" or "the great dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcasticly distanced artist view of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Big cities will always be horribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in horrific ways and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Criticism reaped by Beust for Olympic cancellation
The mayor's bridging of Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has met with fierce criticism in politics and business.
Many want to keep fighting for the games on the water.
But by Beust, realism warns on the assessment of opportunities.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described a renunciation as "not good for the business location" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently developed as great motivational powers in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sporting policy momentum would not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund to apply for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich, which was expected at the beginning of December.
"For us, this preference means that we will have no realistic chances in the period we have been considering until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamt out for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build up a chance by burying the plans already at that time," said HSB President Günter Plaß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application was also in contradiction to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception at the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There Beust described Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as the applicant city last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has put Olympia on the map and excluded housing," said the SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always demanded an integrated planning for the Little Grasbrook for Olympia and a later residential use, the CDU had unilaterally relied on the "event factor".
At the time, the application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had sparked great enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, had failed on Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's crates
If you connect the terms Sweden and wooden box, think of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden throw dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue of works.
A large part of the ninety-four Brillo boxes of the Stockholm type listed there are forgeries.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now coming to a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably also the majority of the approximately hundred other "Brillo boxes" of the "Sportholm" type, which are in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is intertwined, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
They were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably gave permission in 1968 to have a few brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which were then rightly included in the history of art and auctions as authorised original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Typ Stockholm".
Some of them have made more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, examined not only the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, but also three from Swedish private property, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press plates were first primed and sanded, and then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press chipboard with a paint roll without primer - in addition, it is not oil paint but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
In July, of course, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious accusations" raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have given up.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Governmental soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
About half of them went to trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops blocked the district around the noble hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who once commanded the Scout Rangers elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
As early as 2003, Manila's financial district was the main venue for the attempted mutiny of around 200 military personnel against Arroyo.
After almost 24 hours, the uprising failed due to the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
You now hold 20.05 percent of the share capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
The option to increase the share of Versatel is kept open.
With this step, the consolidation of the German DSL market is being promoted, United Internet announced.
Earlier on Wednesday, there had been speculations about entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considers the shares to be only a third party, it was said on the financial market.
On the previous day, United Internet had already acquired a stake in the mobile communications company Drillisch with just under 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of which United Internet has bought for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies have established the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with a share of a good ten percent of Freenet and do not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their shareholding in Freenet AG, they said.
Discussions between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
Freenet's poker, which has lasted for months and is difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held directly 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
It had now been agreed that Drillisch would contribute around four percent more.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
