Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, was extinguished. The prefecture of Normandy informed on Friday. The fire had erupted in the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with about 200 fire engines.
The fire could be stopped
Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. Additives for lubricants are produced in the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work at the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methanethiol escaped due to a leak and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city’s waste water system after an operational accident.
Woman quits her job to look 57 days for her missing bitch
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job for it. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short break in Montana. 57 days lacked every trace of the bitch - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went for dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had panicked dog
In the hope that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King opposite "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic front door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Probably a loud thunder had caused the dog to panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. However, from days to weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake" who quit her job as a postal employee to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man called and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled, according to "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found her."
Losses in the Bundeswehr: machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday September 27th, 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "fearing" extent.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is the result of a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which is reported by the German editorial network.
According to the paper from the office of Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one piece of weapons and 3474 rounds of ammunition have reappeared. The still missing weapons and parts of weapons include six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven guns of the type G3, four guns of the type G36, six signal guns as well as two pistols of the type P8. In addition, 30 gun pipes for machine guns of the type MG3 are missing.
The extent of gun and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was "fearing", said left-wing member of the Bundestag Martina Renner. This was all the more true since hardly anything was found in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance sheet". Renner criticized that the list did not show whether the missing ammunition was also the one that was found in connection with the investigation against the suspected Bundeswehr officer Franco A. "Even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after being determined by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Reflectiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was designated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but initially it remained in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that one wanted to wait for an official notification from Tehran.
On July 19, the "Stena Impero" was charged by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the Hormuz Strait with violating security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belonged to Great Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the Straits. The tensions in the region had increased immensely in recent months. The merchant shipping was drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There were several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has acknowledged the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "State security was taken from terror," she said.
Musk strives for delivery record
Tesla’s quarter may hold record. Despite the delivery boom, the electric car company has recently suffered losses.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electricek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares were out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. Price has not increased so much in almost four months. Tesla delivered a good 95000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its current best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. Six-digit figures have to be produced for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found out this with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress had also been made on the question of why children resist tickling so strongly, only to demand more.
After all, it has also been shown why only the approaching of a tickling hand triggers laughter even before the touch. This lies on a deep layer in the cerebral brain, which triggers the laughter already with the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound area when tickled by humans. This "laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing Is Suppressed While Self - Touching
Up to now, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touching and contact by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers found out in the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex were suppressed during a self-touching. This was also the case when living beings cleaned themselves. During the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh had been intensified.
But if the self-touching and the touch by others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between the self-touching and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-touching activates a brake in the cerebral brain.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they sometimes broke off this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showed flight behaviour or stiffening. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: large fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, considered particularly dangerous, was extinguished, as the prefecture of Normandy informed the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire had erupted the night of Thursday.
According to the authorities, no substances harmful to health are reported to have leaked. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were invited not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session of the parliament after lifting the mandatory recess on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country without an agreement from the EU on 31 October if Brussels does not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, it is unclear how he intends to achieve this.
About Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to unite this country would be to complete the EU exit." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist in 2016 during the referendum campaign.
Memorial to attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims will be unveiled on Saturday in Norway. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They recall the roses that had been laid down by thousands of people in the days and weeks following the attacks in front of the Cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. At the opening, among others Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected.
Right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first set off a car bomb in the government district of Oslo on 22 July 2011 and then shot dozens of participants in a summer camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on the island of Utöya. 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran frees British tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to sail again. It could be a piece of puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been detained in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" has left Bandar Abbas' port and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said shipping director Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it is over," he told the Swedish TV channel SVT.
The London Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the setting of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a news release on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on July 19 on charges of disregarding regulations of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and grueling situation in the last ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Stena Impero": at the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been destined for Syria, was put on the chain there. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the warland Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the US.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Conjecture that it was a trade to free the "Stena Impero", London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormus is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the Straits. The tensions in the region had increased immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents with tankers and drones occurred.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US had unilaterally stepped out of the international nuclear agreement, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time to end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a stricter agreement extended to other areas. Iran resists the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protective powers, wants to ensure the safety of navigation in the Persian Gulf with the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to become a "war-winner." Given the punitive tariffs imposed by America's President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-dispose themselves. Financial leaders of Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country, call India one of UBS's preferred alternatives in a survey. This, of course, has to do not only with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more significant role in the globally diversified production chain.
But now India itself has come to Trump’s focus. Derogating from the white house bellows as the “kingdom of tariffs”, America has withdrawn the trading benefits for 2000 products from the emerging economy at the beginning of June. The US is prohibiting India’s high tariffs and calling for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the friction with India is, of course, only a side-show. In addition, America is also looking at the world’s largest democracy through the security-political glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China’s claims for power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American punitive tariffs against India is unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken up a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh in safety.
The problem, however, lies in a different place: the empirically substantiated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult position in the socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. His zeal for reform aims mainly at the bureaucratic insanity, which for too long suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state. Companies are now getting faster building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for this, seems to liquidateot companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has turned for the better in India in the first five Modi years. However, this does not apply in trade policy. The national conservative government even created new barriers to protect internationally less competitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, Modi is attached to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who renews his country economically radically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. In essence, however, the "India First" advocate never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen, who survive thanks to the foreclosure of their industries, belong to the tribal voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
funeral of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac is to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, reports the news agency AFP citing the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the narrow family circle. A public funeral was scheduled for Sunday in Paris’ Invalidence, as reported by the media.
Driven the competitor to the finish line: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The world’s top was already in the finish line when heartwarming scenes took place in the cooled-down Khalifa International Stadium. Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to waver dangerously in the first run of the men over 5000 metres. He could hardly hold himself on his feet just over 300 metres before the finish line, ran in an unhealthy, bent posture when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly undercut him and dragged him to the finish line for the last half round of the stadium. However, the forces were still sufficient for both of them to stop the watch running along after the finish. As if the scene had not already been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly drew the attention of the assembled journalists. He was shy at first, did not want to talk about his heroic act at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he should not have even started. "That is why I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
That evening he did this with great force - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this heroic feat will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, just over five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, it had all been used, because the Busby, who only got into the finish line with a lot of help, was disqualified at the end of the world athletics association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, started to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18:10.87 minutes, but he was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes before". However, only in training, best times do not count.
Million Meshed: Egyptians Prepare for Wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. An increased police presence was observed in the centre of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations were closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were blocked.
Already in recent days, the police had stepped up their road controls and searched pedestrians’ mobile phones in part on news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, hundreds of people protested against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. Egyptian contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who was living in exile in Spain, who started the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million-dollar march" in central places in the country for Friday. Ali calls for a "people's revolution". The man is not "gooder" for most young Egyptians, because he was a subcontractor to the army, but his messages arrive.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be confirmed independently at first. The government also did not confirm and comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "voluntarily arrested," "just because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW reported, appealing to lawyers arrested. According to their lawyers, the charges against the arrested range from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association." In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces questioned and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW information, also arbitrarily passersby.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail order retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be exempt from VAT on donations in kind, the Ministry explained on a question of the Greens-Bundestag fraction, about which the newspapers of the Funke-Mediengruppe reported on Friday. However, the dealers could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens send back one in six parcels on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - ended up in the garbage afterwards. Donating them would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate donations in kind as a turnover, which then comes into account for VAT.
Green Group MEP Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear by decree that companies cannot evaluate products for sale and can donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies must be able to rely on not being punished for donations, not only for online trade, but also for other businesses from fashion shops to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned off.
For Branczik, Banksy's work highlights "the regression of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes." From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had exhibited the painting again - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change ownership for a million dollars.
On Wednesday, at the first meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, following the lifting of a mandatory break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court, had made a hard exchange of blows with the opposition. Johnson wants to implement the Brexit, which had already been postponed twice on 31 October, if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the work every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The violent verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his senior advisor. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "walking in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday during a book presentation. "We enjoy it. We will (from the EU) quit and we will win."
Johnson had severely attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them of, among other things, "betrayal" to the people. He dismissed accusations that he could put MEPs in danger because they could become targets of death threats, for example, as a "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to restore peace was if MEPs finally respected the British decision to withdraw from the EU. It was not surprising that people were upset that, three years after the referendum, Britain had still not left the EU.
In view of the charged atmosphere, the Bishops of the Anglican Church even called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," said a statement. "And we should listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan Calls for Uno Intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Imran Khan, once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, said Khan at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If this is going badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each control part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn the autonomy status of the Indian Kashmir region and thus dramatically increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It shoots the population with sharp ammunition, over 2000 arrested in the prisons join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything it can to avoid a scenario such as at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions to the streets. And that’s a problem that also el-Sisi’s regime can’t handle, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is at ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who it finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the suppression but also the biggest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, when large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER boss: no more "showstoppers" for capital airport
For two months, it was examined whether the complex system mesh works in conjunction with BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the progress. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv audits in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the supervisory board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there were still shortcomings in the terminal to work out. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured, the timetable until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large. The construction completion display is now to be submitted to the building office during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables are still to be corrected; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work has to be continued on the processing of the deficiencies", said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there was a lack of evidence, less a lack of new cables. There is also no clearance for all the dowels on which the cable lines are attached. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station below the terminal does not work satisfactorily yet. The problems had already led the project three years ago into another crisis. This time it is about smoke aprons, which shut down in a fire like a canvas, so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 motors therefore have to be replaced. Then there should be new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally it was due to go into operation in 2011. The costs have increased since construction began in 2006 from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros at the opening next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the responsible persons are planning to expand the airport. That is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board will take place on 18 October, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance director Heike Fölster will join Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Automats for Drug Exploded - Police Arrests Man
He needed money for drugs - and blew up a number of machines in the city of Chemnitz! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines blown up in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply. Millions of damage has been caused!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police seized a 33-year-old German on Bürgerstraße and on Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the initiation of explosive explosions in a criminal unit with particularly serious cases of theft, which were led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old confirmed itself".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "He apparently financed his narcotics dependence with the loot."The bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on Bürgerstraße four times alone between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The vending machine bomber is now in custody, and the police investigation against him is continuing.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automatic jumps in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is revising its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price fight with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed a press spokesman of Austrian Airlines to the APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa-Billigflieger Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. From January 2020, AUA will take over this in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the speaker explained. The flight times will be coordinated with connecting flights. The aim is on the one hand to strengthen the Vienna hub and on the other hand to expand the decentralised traffic from the federal states.
According to AviationNetOnline, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "production company" for the AUA group sister. Barcelona and Rome, among others, would be operated with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings equipment. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants would be from Eurowings. According to the report, Eurowings flights departing under AUA flight number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but in the same way as AUA in Terminal 3.
A price fight broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki broke out. Ryanair’s subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna will be increased to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airliner will send four Ryanair aircraft including crews to Vienna, also in the so-called “Wetlease”, which criticized the union as a circumvention construct to the collective agreement.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's statement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years' time said on Friday AUA board member Andreas Otto: "We will remain number one at the site in five, six or ten years."
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now marry the last of the four. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have called for his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) during the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month. This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so excited to start this adventure together and can't wait to actually be married," the couple, who have been together since October 2018 according to British media reports, announced in the official release.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced in the coming months.
But it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne succession and the real estate mogul will be a similar celebration as the marriage of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what does heart failure or heart attack really trigger? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetic material of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Hochgebirgsklinik Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the main influencing risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at UKE.
Currently, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations -, according to the hospital. Every year, about 200 were added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. According to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center, the data could also be useful in researching other common diseases. New findings on the interplay between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a firm will to use the data to study other diseases. The Foundation’s clinic in Davos has so far been dealing with allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be established on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics should be created. In support of his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated at the open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The organic samples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the Hamburg City Health Study. According to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 subjects. The scientists assured that genetic decryption is strictly concerned with the protection of the anonymised data. It is a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the genetic material of a human being can now be decoded within 24 hours. The pure material costs would amount to 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, had cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on 1 October, all 9000 samples are expected to be analyzed by the end of 2020. Initial results are expected the following year.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were still underage, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. Indeed, the protégés were held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred pupils, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran School has existed for about ten years. Residents had drawn the attention of the authorities to repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents were shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They did not know about the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to Niger in the last ten months.
Chained and Tortured: Nigeria's Police Free 400 Children from School
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria freed almost 400 students from appalling conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries suggesting torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
The children had been discovered there on Thursday after a note in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "unworthy of man". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been held at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed emaciated and injured students in a clearly poor health.
World football choice: further accusations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, other countries made accusations to Fifa. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
In recent years, a lot of Fifa has proved to be offensive: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Footballers' Election has not been suspected of going wrong - if one does not assume that the national coaches and national team captains with the right to vote of the member associations often vote in sympathy rather than in objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua’s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt laments that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting overview.
The fifa apologized for the fact that "the signatures on the election forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan’s Trainer also Wonders
There is also an outcry about the election from Sudan. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the way it was ultimately judged: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was received in the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: "Didn't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
On Friday, the Federation reported: True, but of course it was not intentional. The completed election documents were "mistakenly" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, according to a message from the Federation. However, the second captain, Manuel Rosas, had actually chosen. "We assume responsibility for the administrative error," said the announcement. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is on the official list of FIFA".
The other cases are now being examined by Fifa, but it is emphasized that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly spoken out for an official investigation against US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, it is determined by the facts that are being determined." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyi to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden has been observing "for years".
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair, only a few have shown discomfort about it. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned against Trump’s policy several times, for example against easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker as governors of U.S. states have no formal say in the trial against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, first Republican senators have also expressed a critical opinion about the situation. For example, Mitt Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second parliamentary chamber, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing".
The affair could result in the initiation of an impeachment procedure against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation on this, accusing him of misuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could exert a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on a real impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the chances of success of such a procedure are low. So far, no U.S. President has been relieved by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board of Rackete's Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, reportedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June, after she had illegally launched the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations against Rackete are being made. Thus, three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects were arrested in a detention centre in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any reliable information about it," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured, and even murdered. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence," the news said at the time.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators will also be on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed up."
Italy's right-wing ex-Interior Minister Matteo Salvini immediately asked Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration, to apologize.
Musk strives for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares were out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. Price has not increased so much in almost four months. Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its current best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit figures have to be produced for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
US budget dispute: Once again only a bridge financing
The new financial year will start in the United States on October 1st without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing until November 21st.
Although US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States will once again be without spending plans before the new fiscal year, which begins on 1 October. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have taken place on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration will now be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019, which will end on Monday. This is because Congress has not reached agreement on the 12 spending laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. For the time being, therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit from the expenditure framework extended from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio. $ for the new financial year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly capable of multiplying.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion to build the Wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are disturbed by the plans for the Wall and its financing, which is actually planned for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
The Spirits Divide at the Wall
It is currently unclear how the parties intend to approach this issue. An extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November is more likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks. A shutdown is also not excluded.
Against the background of Congress’ continuing inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process gain popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the federal administration’s funding at the previous year’s level, prevent parliamentarians’ travel activities and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill whereby all women can claim in vitro fertilisation, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous sperm donation.
The presentation still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that numerous "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core element of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial insemination for all women are to be borne by social security.
Fertilization with semen from dead husband continues to be prohibited
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to their dead husband’s sperm for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is allowed “post-mortem”. In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women have in vain complained about the release of a deceased’s sperm. Opponents of the advance in Paris argued that such a begotten child would then bear a “particularly severe fate”.
Numerous members of the La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) ruling party of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had, on the other hand, spoken out in favour of artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be given a "double grief" if the death of her husband would also leave her child's wish unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot father children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain forbidden.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women, but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: Calls for flight charges for universities are getting louder
A lot is being flown to the universities, which is why the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future. The rectors say that they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on a climate tax on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is gaining momentum again. After the State Rectors’ Conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral students from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university plead for compensation for service flights. This is the first step "urgently necessary", at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, according to their statement. Meanwhile, the cabinet decision originally planned in July is still on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the submission of the Greens.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB intelligence service, the prisoners were reported to have illegally fished in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested. At that time, there was a firefight between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his severe injuries. This time, however, there were no casualties, they said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian territorial waters. According to their own statements, the coastguard of Russia is patrolling for the protection of their marine biological resources.
30,000 octopus seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 squids were discovered and confiscated on the boats. Furthermore, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s fishing authority had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested there for some time this year.
Georgi Martynov, head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close mesh synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be taken out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be decomposed.
In the future, only 18.000: USA lowers asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is sealing itself off from those seeking protection: as confirmed by the State Department in Washington, the upper limit for the legal immigration of refugees will be further lowered. In future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low border for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department declared. In the now almost expired marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to accept protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under Barack Obama’s predecessor government, much higher admission limits had been applied.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee program in 1980. The State Department nevertheless described the US as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a phrase strongly reminiscent of the language used by the incumbent US president.
Trump explained that a "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at enabling refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild them. His harsh course in migration policy is strongly supported by supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A big issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selensky affair and a potentially imminent impeachment procedure.
According to the Foreign Office, the U.S. government intends to focus on the reception of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and have thus been in danger, as the statement of the State Department shows. On the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States only signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration at the US's southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires zoo to a collecting station for apes in the USA at the request of the Argentine court. The "Sandra", born in 1986 at the Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person", therefore her release is mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - not as a passenger, but in the cargo compartment, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkey is not able to adapt to life in the wild, she is to live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly pet of pop star Michael Jackson. However, before moving into Florida, "Sandra" has to endure a 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights, which was initiated by animal protectionists in 2014, helped to transform the zoo in Buenos Aires into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and education centre was to be established there to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Hussar ride at the almost 3000-metre-high Great Peak in the Italian Alps.
Without grid, double ground or other aids, the Swiss defeated the 550-metre-high north face of the Great Peak in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus he undercut the old best mark by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, US sporting goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profit. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (just under €1.3 billion), which is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor addresses its customers directly online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period up to the end of August. Nike sales grew most strongly in China with an increase of 22 percent. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to address consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that strategic investments by Nike will further advance the "digital transformation" of the sporting goods manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifetime ban on stadiums due to racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital imposed a life-long stadium ban on a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and urged his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Pride to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted late on Thursday. He had reported the account of the fan to Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma fan could never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. One has to identify the responsible and throw them out of the stadiums", Fifa President Gianni Infantino said last weekend. The reason for the statement was racist chants at the First League party between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence last Sunday.
But there were also discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rioting fans of record champion Juventus Turin. Four of them are no longer allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed. For the rest, prohibitions of four to seven years apply.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in the Juventus area. The twelve are accused of serious blackmail, money laundering and private violence, among other things. The club had started the investigation with a complaint last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and allegedly blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole years are considered with grippy terms. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With this call, the crab catch officially started on September 21 at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun, which also heralded the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee's Public Relations Department.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The magnificent natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started to breed crabs in the early 1990s. Over the years, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that has provided high incomes and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively engaged in large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as in technology-based crab farming. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services" and has carefully built up the service network for "permissions under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network for services, a platform for lending" to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local benefits of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, taking advantage of the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as flagships to host intelligent high-end production companies, biomedicine and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health industries, and organic farming companies leading in the "3+2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the establishment of a national tourism zone covering all areas and of tourist destinations of national importance, integrating the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape, improving the state of civil services and public services buildings, vigorously developing the "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" areas, and advancing the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and the US: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, on his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States had promised an end to all sanctions, Ruhani stated on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the events as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting be held. "And America says I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The nature of the sanctions that should be ended has been the subject of debate. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all the sanctions."
However, this move had not been made in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticized. In view of the current punitive measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated with Russia and China, which is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes shook western Turkey in a very short time, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. Thus, the fear of a catastrophe is growing.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The earthquake of 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Now the government wants to use a commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built homes collapse - among other things, they are made miserable by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
For years, urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning that large open areas that have been registered as refuges in the centre have long since been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the earthquake of Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as reported by the civil protection authority Afad. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu announced on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings for security reasons in the district of Silivri. Some students cried, as shown in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly Earthquake-prone. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of the magnitudes 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. During the earthquake on Thursday it hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with everything necessary standing next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wobbles. When the next big quake comes, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on his return from New York, said that eight people had been injured, and that some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom), according to which two minarets of mosques collapsed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On the social networks many users report panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned about aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the quake is reported to be 13:59 o'clock (local time). According to CNN Turkey, only a few minutes after the first quake there was an aftershock, which was indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt up to Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the civil protection authority Afad informed already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge itself - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy reckons that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These may be the signs of a major earthquake," says Ersoy to the transmitter. "Before or after the big quake will come."
There had already been an incident a few weeks ago - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. Moreover, there had only been a violent earthquake in Albania a few days ago - there were 68 injured. The earth had also trembled at Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New Ignition Substance in Ukraine's Affair
Two explosive documents fuel the Ukraine affair over possible misuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the US democrats see themselves strengthened: The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president contain important clues for investigations against the President. Trump once again sees himself as a victim of a "witch hunt". Moreover, he doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passengers locked in the toilet - plane diverted
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight has been diverted by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline reported according to US media.
At an out-of-plan stopover in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time), the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. She had been locked in it for about an hour, wrote U.S. media referring to other passengers. Passengers had to change planes to continue their flight to San Francisco.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which according to US media is supposed to come from flight 1554, you can see how several people try to free the woman. "We're currently working to open the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. Initially it was open whether the woman would receive compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "Die Verwandlung", British success author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on 27 November, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) reported. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people and is determined to let nothing or anyone stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers shamelessly lie like the Soviet leaders once, if Brexiteers in high positions almost imploring the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write." By McEwan the novel "Machines Like Me" had only appeared in the spring about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, deals with Gregor Samsa, who one morning wakes up and sees himself "turned into a tremendous vermin", is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that is upside down," says Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austrian rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution by freight trains. Furthermore, sections of the rail connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all trips until 31 October 2019, including 31 October 2019, one day after his insolvency application. Travel could not be started "for insolvency reasons", the company informed on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings made by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. The company left open the way for journeys starting on 1 November 2019. In coordination with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it was said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes, among others, Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers wants to transfer money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday hotels abroad, which are currently still hosting Thomas Cook vacationers, will receive money from Zurich Insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer required to make extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without presentation of separate invoices, hotels in the resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook travelers are not required to pay individual hotel bills or otherwise required by these hotels from now on," said speaker Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own information, had been forced to pay for their own accommodation on site. Some therefore had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
The number of hotels affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesman. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were still on their way. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return travel for Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are currently on the move. It looks bad for Thomas Cook customers who still want to fly on holiday. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including October 31 would be cancelled. This also applies to those bookings that have already been paid.
The company left open the question of how to start travelling from 1 November 2019. In coordination with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined. In principle, Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry Destroys Explosion Mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana's engagement. In Africa, he is now directly following in the footsteps of his mother.
In Angola, British Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed an explosive mine with a blue shrapnel protection vest.
Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust near Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. Safely away, the explosive exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same detonator, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take the path she took at that time. The images on which Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that with him, there will be no guarantee of a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements have been made by the polarizing British for ever. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a sword of Damocles over the Blondshopf. His suspension of Parliament, in order to be able to conduct its Brexit course stubbornly until the date of departure, was cancelled earlier this week. And a bill passed by parliament obliges Johnson to effect an extension of the bilateral talks until 31 October in case of failed negotiations with the EU. Johnson, however, had categorically ruled out this again and again.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
But the pressure does not seem to go past Johnson. In the meantime, when visiting a hospital, he made suggestions that, in the event of disagreement, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal, I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running out for Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have about six weeks to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. However, the recent talks have again failed to achieve a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister fails to comply with the law, a new postponement of the withdrawal date is in place. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister’s words. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authorities: Further deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the US has increased to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the US health authority CDC reported. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine" there were already more than 900 affected persons, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. So far no similar increase in lung damage is known in Europe. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Mohammed Ali’s videos have been divided into online networks millions of times, and the Spanish-based developer and actor calls for a “people’s revolution.” For Friday, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass demonstrations with one million participants in central places in the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. There was already an increased police presence in the centre of Cairo. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. Already in the past few days, the police had intensified their road controls and searched pedestrians' mobile phones partly on news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, hundreds of people protested in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time" informed HRW, appealing to lawyers arrested.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo has blocked websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has been ruling the country since 2013, after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox of Greenland expedition back
Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival in the port of Hamburg, he was greeted, among other things, by skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg with the racing yacht "Malizia" across the Atlantic.
In recent months, Fuchs and a team of scientists have been investigating and documenting the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak out. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public", said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of global warming and the waste of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, Greenland ice had been measured with a drone and fished with nets for microplastics, they said.
During the Hamburg Climate Week, the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans". "Arved Fuchs is a great role model for all of us who care about the survival of the oceans," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades."
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 Euros for noodles
430 Euro for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: Two Japanese tourists seemed too much. The bill with 80 Euro tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases damage the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the Association of Travel Guides in Rome, demanded, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The response of the owners of the restaurant promptly came. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this is not to be seen from the invoice. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is also normal, the innkeeper said.
A phone call to Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually face an impeachment procedure after the turbulent revelations of recent days, the Democrats now want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is of weeks until a decision is made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy. The accusation of the whistleblower, who brought the conversation with concern for national security and for the democracy of the USA with his complaint to the public, is monstrous: the President abused the power of his office in order to instrumentalize the government of another country for influencing the election 2020. He had used the dependence of Ukraine in blackmail and wanted to force it to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the meanwhile published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the telephone conversation of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, the centre of which is, in addition to Trump, his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins in May 2019 when Rudy Giuliani’s New York Times reports travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with President Selensky, who has just been elected, in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are tricky. “We don’t interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation, for which we have the right,” he says to the newspaper. One might think that it is inappropriate, but “there is nothing illegal about it.” Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine, for which there is hardly any basis – “because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could prove to be helpful to my government.”
The lawyer and former mayor of New York seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasies, which are fixed on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for the Russian investigations in the US. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk so prominently about on the phone with Selenskyj in July. Giulianis and the President’s version reads: former Vice President and currently promising candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as the Obama administration’s Ukraine representative, had urged the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Schokin, in order to stop the investigation of the gas company he was responsible for, on whose board his son Hunter Biden was active. Biden senior had extorted Ukraine financially in order to cover up the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General should leave, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Moreover, Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt conduct, the US government was by far not the only Western partner to press for his release. Moreover, the Obama administration explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Disturbances on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, the UK and Spain are mainly affected. On the website allemörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not been charging again and again since about 3.30 p.m. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disruption, although not to date to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disruptions
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services were cancelled for several hours. And as in previous cases, users use Twitter as their main source of trouble.
Polish Scientists Saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were on their way with a dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the news, at just ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the inflatable".
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977 and 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER recharge wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently entered the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - first and foremost the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In case of wireless charging, the researchers have measured more than 30 degrees even with the perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is somewhat beside the coil, the temperature increases even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role in this. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but also does not last that long. Thus, the service life is reduced. Therefore, the researchers advise that the smartphone should always be charged by cable. Since a battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of a battery exchange once again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels as well as cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and tedious plug-fumble. Since Qi (which stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, in which Apple exceptionally participates, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau-Photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber reportedly climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and set a record, his expedition operator announced.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He made international headlines before: From him comes a photo of climbers who are standing in line on Mount Everest in the spring.
The image of the mass crowd triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848 meter high mountain and highest summit of the earth. In May, eleven climbers had died during the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. Among other things, bad weather is mentioned as the reason for this. At the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China in order to enable him to climb.
Four Dead Elephants Discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman announced on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously remained harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants still live in Sri Lanka. In theory, the death penalty is due to their killing.
Holden British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its establishment by Iran. According to the news agency IRNA, the seafaring agency Bandar Abbas announced this. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker flying the British flag on 19 July under the charge of disregarding regulations of the sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook’s Management in Criticism
The House of Commons’ responsible economic committee wants to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook in a comprehensive manner, dealing with the board’s salary packages as well as the question of why the British government did not want to financially join the company that is struggling for survival. “Our interest is in company supervision as well as external auditor control,” said committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. “We are obviously dealing with a bad example of management greed.”
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the family-wide increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits probably weigh heavier than previously assumed. DKFZ scientists stress that this has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colorectal cancer.
Elon Musk Increases Tesla Shares
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". Demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, according to Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to customers. Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares left trading with an increase of more than six percent. Price has not increased so much in almost four months. Tesla delivered a good 95’000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its current best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. Six-digit figures have to be produced for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Will British Government Avoid Brexit Law? Johnson Reticent
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for ways of circumventing the law recently passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On a corresponding question, he merely said to journalists on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU exit.
Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran seems to be ramping up uranium enrichment
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. “Unfortunately, the European states show inability or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions,” Rohani said at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday. In case they did not make their promises, he promised “further steps” away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained in return the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement to force Iran to change its course in the Middle East policy deemed aggressive. President Donald Trump’s government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now again relying on harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently responded by resuming the uranium enrichment limit in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or at least prepared for use the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not prepared to bear their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rohani conjectured. However, there would still be further talks that hopefully would bring a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran’s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia, the situation changed in mid-September: Germany, France and the UK followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had committed themselves to the attack, which was considered a false confession by the US. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders would not have been able to do so during the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would only have claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration would first have to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He called on the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet crossed by other star solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space, which was first achieved. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was only a guess at first is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was christened after its discoverer to 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The well-traveled comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Follow-up of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not originate from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017 only the second interstellar object, which was sighted during a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close insights into a foreign solar system before it never disappears again. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet resembles that of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. "The current velocity of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency Nasa in a message.
According to analyses, the comet travels on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially listed under catalogue number C/2019 Q4, received the designation 2I/Borisov from it, whereby the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov was already sighted in approach. Thus, the researchers remain for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already guided the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers in a first study. Images of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form by similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates, according to the IAU, that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the European space agency Esa.
The agency wants to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German for example comet interceptor) in a waiting position at 1.5 million kilometres from the Earth until 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is supposed to either lurk on an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just in time before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic of China, a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines has landed on the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for the captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers will be handled at the new airport every year, and by 2025, it will be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “sea star” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway will transport passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly reported that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has so far been postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger aircraft landed after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - this is what the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming of. This special propulsion system (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire is developing for the 2030s, is intended to make possible, the US station CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely do this," said agency head Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
To advance the project, the British Space Agency intends to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. The Concorde was the only supersonic passenger aircraft to date to cover the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours to complete. In 2000, an accident occurred when a Concorde was launched at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space agency Nasa, the "X-Plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," says Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. Moreover, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable framing devices".
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down potential leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday in front of U.S. ambassadors to the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy," and in the past they had been "a little different" than they are today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tippers. The event was actually not public. However, several US media broadcasted audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the President’s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for an impeachment trial against Trump. Their accusations are based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who raises serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. On great public pressure, the whistleblower’s statements were published on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials that the US president "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country interferes in the 2020 U.S. election in his favor.
At the heart of the accusations is a controversial telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to conduct investigations that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about former business of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is in the race for the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up in view of Ukraine’s telephone call: leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been made. However, after the conversation, according to instructions from White House lawyers, this had been removed from a database usually intended for this purpose and instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is unknown to the public, and the New York Times reported that it should be an employee of the CIA foreign intelligence agency.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had distributed second-hand information that had turned out to be incorrect.
However, as Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have given the whistleblower information, he was indignant. Nancy Pelosi, chairman of the US House of Representatives, reacted with concern and lamented that Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
Various investigations against Trump and his environment have been underway in various committees in the House of Representatives for months. In view of Ukraine’s accusations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with new force in order to initiate a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
"The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, accused him of a misrepresentation of things and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insults ship and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. officials from the security and foreign policy fields, who were mostly working under democratic, but also under republican presidents, stood behind the democrats’ investigation into a possible impeachment procedure in a statement published on Friday. If the accusations were true, it would be "an unscrupulous abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could exert a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision to actually withdraw from office would be made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US President has been relieved by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW works council: jobs are being "slowly" dismantled
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of these, 500 million euros will be saved this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be dismantled at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security up to 2029 applies.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from works council circles, jobs in production, which are actually not at the disposition, are "sneakly" dismantled by another way - i.e., past the official course. Thus, regular vacancies are often not filled again.
In these cases, the works council had no way to force the re-occupation. Meanwhile, in many places, there was a lack of personnel, the increase in workload, the worries about a gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants would increase. This also raised the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW only said: "An adjustment of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and control new projects centrally. This is also intended to reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production Board member Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: "In times of uncertainty from Brexit to the impending trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof."
There are already successes in this way: for example, this year, production costs per vehicle would decrease for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Tostmann said to journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours.
Twenty hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg parent plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants produce components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year to ensure that the plant is profitably profitable. However, in 2018, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining demand for diesel and the problems with the conversion to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas testing process.
However, as Production Board member Tostmann announced last year, one million cars are to be rolled off the line "in perspective" in Wolfsburg. This should make the bundling of the golf production at the main plant possible - because the Zwickau plant delivers the golf production through the conversion to the location for the e-car production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations are now resting on Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build up e-mobility, it is planned to remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburg for the time being.
Forced to Prostitution with Voodoo: Traffickers Sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, sent to the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected traffickers are forced to go to prison.
Six suspected Nigerian traffickers were sentenced to probation and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The accused had sent young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women who wanted to leave had to make a ritual vow in front of a Voodoo priest in their homeland.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in inflatable boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed among various brothels in order to work out the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the insertion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and psychologically difficult to do," said judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were quite disgusted."
The sentences are based on commercial and gang-based smuggling of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant union Ufo once again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "inform about the labour dispute measures in the LH Group on 14 October", informed Ufo tariff board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to negotiate with Ufo for months. This also concerns the question of whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal against it. "I consider it unlikely that a second court would consider the matter completely different," said Ufo board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted a request to the Regional Labour Court in Frankfurt to have the status of Ufo as a union reviewed in court. The company argues that the union has not appointed a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
There was a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, during which numerous members of the board and the advisory board resigned, including the long-standing union leader Nicoley Baublies. Ufo had suspended a preliminary vote on strikes by cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about its leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is about to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and domestic visitors will be increased to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission announced.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually given only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the erzkonservativeKingdom hopes for more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production collapsed dramatically, oil prices were rising. It should take several weeks for the Kingdom’s oil production to reach its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram stories on Thursday (local time) on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits printed with bananas on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to get married in church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the yes word a year ago in a New York registry office. There had not been a bigger party at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the town of Mecin (Metschin), the police reported. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had sent an emergency signal via GPS. During the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of the accident still has to be determined. The crash site is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the causes of the threat, reported the World Conservation Union IUCN in Brussels on Friday. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 would be at the highest level of risk and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "at risk", "strongly endangered", "at risk of extinction" and "extinguished in nature" to "extinguished". In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Chestnuts and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) are especially threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered "at risk" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan mini moth next to a fungus. It has spread from south-eastern Europe all over the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 specimens.
Shrub species and mosses also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. "We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority".
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
34 people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. According to the figures, there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 shook the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the million metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly Earthquake-prone. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plates.
One of the most severe quakes was one of 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday, a quake of 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the half-time show
Latin-pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the mid-term show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced this on Twitter. "It won't be any bigger," Shakira wrote about a photo of herself and Lopez. She is excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be time in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had been dreaming of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying to the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL exists 100 years and I will perform with another Latina." She could hardly wait "to show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world."
Shakira pointed out in an explanation that she felt honored to stand next to another artist on one of the largest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "Kings" were on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining audiences
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have recently dropped audience numbers: This February, the spectacle attracted the fewest viewers in the USA for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
The mid-term show of the last Super Bowl had been in turmoil in the run-up to it: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform last February. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had fallen to his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL matches at the National Anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been unaffiliated since March 2017 and has no longer contested an NFL party. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook broke: hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to face the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook. High write-offs on outstanding bonds and loans are threatening. Credit Suisse is also affected by this, writes the "Financial Times" in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to write down a total of up to GBP 1.8 billion (around EUR 2 billion) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept write-offs of 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the lenders between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually to be written off are likely to be at the upper end of the ranges, an expert told the paper.
After the insolvency proceedings have ended, the amount of the creditors’ losses will be clear. A person close to this procedure did not exude too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook’s approximately 40 aircraft in Great Britain are “old” and many of the properties are in bad locations. The most money can probably be obtained with the sale of the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it was further stated.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
The Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any reliable information about it ourselves," said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy, accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the detention centre in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organisations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29th, and had rammed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects were reported to have arrived there. The captain is being investigated for aiding illegal immigration.
USA warn federal government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe the risks are too high," Pai told the "Handelsblatt" with regard to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges any company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security authorities.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC chief adds. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a "declaration of trust" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" on the basis of its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not just hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It would be "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," continued the FCC chief.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque, and the employee company, which is said to own the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
The U.S. had findings that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the U.S.
Chemical plant in northern France burns: schools closed
During the night local residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky above a North French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - the cleaning up work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities the facilities would not be opened on Friday, the responsible prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injured. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that smell will spread after the deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 police officers and gendarmes were in use at the site of the fire.
A gigantic black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told the BFMTV news station that there was initially no "high toxicity" detected in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. Dams against pollution had been built in the river, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out in the early morning around 2:40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to worsen in order to make the necessary decisions".
Action would have to be taken by those states that have budgetary margins for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France has no such room for manoeuvre, the Minister added, referring to the country’s high level of national debt, which is more than 98 percent of GDP. French public debt must be “stabilised” and “reduced”, said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly asked France to control its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is thus responding, among other things, to the protests of the yellow vest movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes Parliament's "Capitulation Act".
The parliament is back, a law dictates to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics fear, however, that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, addressed to this possibility, the Tory politician evades.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering himself over whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit, despite the law recently passed by parliament, which is supposed to prevent this. On a corresponding question, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU exit. Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Meanwhile, Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings said that he felt that the political conflicts surrounding Brexit were "walking in the park" and was confident that the desired exit from the EU would still be achieved: "We enjoy that, we will win, we will quit (note: from the EU), don't worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" during a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the EU referendum in 2016, now acts as the chief strategist in the British government seat Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they were all in front of Linda McCartney's camera, who became one of the big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (pockets) plunges deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders front woman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the immediate magic of Polaroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found her way to photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids she made, a few hundred of them are now released for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always in the focus: Her husband Paul - as you might have never seen him before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, telephones in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland also led a completely normal life. So Mary McCartney said according to the BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made out of old potato boxes. And it has not always been cleaned up with the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decision click: you have to realize if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to take it at exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you take it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift to capture exactly the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the cut-out and the colours are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to anecdotes, where landscapes look like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from its neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop the import of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "retired due to the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic since its exit from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran secretly pursues a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably.
US government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the US State Department declared that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department stated that although the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, the main task was to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overburdened.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on the reception of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been in danger, as the State Department statement shows. However, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The 1980 program selects refugees from UN camps all over the world and resettles them in the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. The current ceiling of 30,000 is already a low. When US President Donald Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was almost 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted horribly to the announced lowering of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would continue to damage its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US – legally and illegally – according to the US government, 350,000 asylum applications are expected for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Get close to a snitch"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage. Whoever has given evidence to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power, “comes close to an informer,” Trump said, according to a record of a private event in New York on Thursday. Several U.S. media reports agree.
As a result, Trump spoke to employees of the U.S. UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This is close to a snitch." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayals, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
Observers evaluated the latter comment on a possible allusion to the death penalty. Democrats strongly criticized Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment procedure against him, the presidents of the Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory Committees in the House of Representatives wrote.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now published complaint that he has abused his office in order to ask for interference from another country in the US election in 2020. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation Trump advised him to initiate investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informants are. However, according to the New York Times, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat capsized: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean Sea
Time and again, people try to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. Often too small boats regularly capsize. Seven migrants have died when a rubber boat falls, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios seven migrants were killed when a rubber boat was destroyed. Among the fatalities were also a baby and four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is said to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small archipelago of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not known from which countries the migrants come from. Currently hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in much too small boats. Last year 174 people were killed on this route according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The Who Cancels Concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has reached an abrupt end due to an indisposition of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston his voice failed to serve. In the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it while it is still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey "can't speak now." Townsend promised the audience to get his money's worth at a reparation concert. However, an appointment has not yet been made.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver scheduled performances canceled The Who. They are to be caught up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small start-up to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords must fear for billions of dollars.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to disrupt balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. A few days ago, the company had sold founder Adam Neumann as chief, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives in order to gain financial flexibility for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British Financial Times reports that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, the largest tenant of office space in New York and London is suddenly off the market.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and leases it to members in some small units in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has been burning money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year, the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year, the rental costs alone are said to have increased to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars due to the rental of ever-new large areas. In order to limit the loss, the new management should now have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into lease agreements with maturities of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months. WeWork’s new contracts alone made the demand for offices in New York greater than the new areas that were launched during this time. Without WeWork’s expansion, the office vacancy in the U.S. metropolis would have increased at that time, as Alpert wrote in the “Business Insider”. Similarly, London is where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in a prime location.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could shift noticeably without a further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably have to write off some of the billion-dollar income they hoped for. They do not have access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term leases. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork usually takes place through each of the extra-found subsidiaries, so-called special purpose vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 poachers had been arrested, who had illegally fished in the waters, according to the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB informed the agency Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them injured. This time, there were no casualties, they said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian territorial waters. According to their own information, the coast guard of Russia is patrolling for the protection of their marine biological resources. 30,000 octopus fish were discovered during the re-checks. Furthermore, according to the information, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the Ria Novosti agency, the coast guard found more than 8,000 infringements in 2018.
According to the media, thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been arrested there for some time in 2019.
Georgi Martynov, head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close mesh synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be taken out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be destroyed. Even the ships themselves would not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the arrests of the previous week. According to the FSB, another wounded North Korean died later due to his injuries. On September 17, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
USA imposes entry ban on former President Castro
The U.S. has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, and the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in "big human rights violations." As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he was in charge of a system in which thousands of Cubans were arbitrarily arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As president of the armed forces, Fidel Castro, the brother of the Revolutionary leader who died, is also responsible for human rights violations there through the support of President Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," tweeted American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had declared entry bans among others against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro’s government to force him to his knees and to help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of Maduro’s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are likely to start due to the time shift before the protests spread across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how much global support will be on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
Last Friday, especially in Germany, the influx was very large. According to estimates by Fridays for Future, a good third of all global demonstrators – around 1.4 million – had participated in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland in Sylt.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had taken a stand in the Swedish parliament in August 2018 in order to call on the politicians of their country to make a greater commitment to climate protection. This has led to the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short period of time. Students and students in particular participate in the climate protests, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against earth heating and the impending climate catastrophe. In particular, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York almost a month ago after a two-week transatlantic trip with a high seas yacht. There she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke emphatically to the heads of state and government of the earth. In her home Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony, which is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow, according to the Tass Agency. The ban is due to enter into force on 1 October.
Those who smoke nevertheless must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, burning candles also fall under the ban. Also grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer permitted.
Attack against cybercriminals - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time removed a large server provider for illegal business on the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as the operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Mosel, through which international criminals operated their activities.
This was announced by the Attorney General’s Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects were said to have been the operators of the world's second largest darknet drug marketplace, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had smashed in the spring. According to the Attorney General's Office, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyber bunker.
Such a hoster had been removed in Germany for the first time, they said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go out on the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
Protests are planned in at least 65 cities in Germany, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia and Westerland in Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada.
Who are Thunberg's backmen?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm up the climate. All the more astonishing is that a 16-year-old girl of all people of this time is holding the mirror in front of the power man. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical mastery or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and makes young people rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically speaking, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to win a crowd of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time, he was able to win over a crowd of young people and persuade them to cross the sea in order to enter the promised country, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently set out for America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadowy side to this? Why does a share called "We don't have time" need to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold far-reachingly, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Even proven followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably too big on some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into effect in the media worldwide very well and a lot of money flows thanks to the impressive action.
This is where the spirits are divided: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work with stockbrokers during the World Rescue Action? No matter what position is ultimately taken in this, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question seemingly pious intentions of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is crossing our solar system right now.
Astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: a foreign comet is crossing our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet of another star is crossing our solar system at the moment. It was baptized after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked up to the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was seen during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain insights into a foreign solar system from nearby. Apparently, the comet resembles that of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar in origin and currently moves on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that leads it out of our system.
Comet was sighted before approach - and can be observed several months
But before the time comes, astronomers can observe him in detail. Unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be between 2 and 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems similar to our comets - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form by similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual findings. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids keep busy the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson appalled at brother
His younger brother is leaving the cabinet, and now his sister, with clear words, scourges the prime minister's warlike language as "delicious." It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Fraud", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly upgrading - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive indignation from the opposition, and in the meantime more critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother was using words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered." She considered this to be extremely reprehensible. She did not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had competed in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
In particular, she came across the fact that her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly member of the House of Commons who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 referendum, could best honor their memory by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons. "It is very tasteless to refer to a MP who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," Johnson's sister criticized. The perpetrator apparently came from the extreme right-wing camp that felt "encouraged by this kind of language." It was very tasteless for all those who mourned for her.
The widower of Cox also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand up passionately and decisively for what you believe in - no matter what you think. But you should never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. "I've been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest over the past few months - it's an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "is not worthy of this country." In a joint statement they stated: "In recent days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL sets a strong sign: In the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the upcoming final of the US football league NFL. The organizers announced this on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the US," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2nd in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl is putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises "an explosion of fun and energy" for the show.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in German cinemas from November on in the drama "Hustlers".
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the US every time. This year, many also regard the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump’s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest U.S. sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, over 100 million viewers watch the NFL final, and it is now extremely popular in Germany.
Political controversies occurred in the run-up to last year. The reason for this was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise up in protest against police violence against blacks when playing the national anthem and had been dealt with hard by US President Donald Trump among others. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. Many people ultimately criticized the fact that the rock group Maroon 5 was performing.
An actor and Youtuber joins Egypt's ruler: Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad for the time being.
The two men who have an influence on whether there is blood on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad. One of them floated back to Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former General, who dropped Muslim brother Mohammed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state in 2013, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's action against political Islam and had not lost any syllables about the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the President. He had "no reason to worry," said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of state television. "The Egyptians do not let themselves be misled".
In the opinion of the president, this is what the other man is trying to do, who is currently determining what is happening on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he eludes the access of the security forces, who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, living rooms and tearooms of the country: with his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets" Ali calls his compatriots to rise against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president indulges in luxury and allows himself to be built magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with precisely these gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a construction contractor, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After last week, for the first time since Sisi's grip on power, thousands had demonstrated against his rule and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million-dollar march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would dare to walk the streets, but there were occasional smaller protests, for example in Giza near Cairo and in the village of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos were not independently verified at first. Security circles said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators tore banners with the President's portrait to pieces last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and along the outpost streets. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city centre were closed for "maintenance work", most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And in Rabaa Square, where supporters of the overthrown Muslim brother Morsi were entrenched in 2013, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent discontent from gathering: Sisi's Future Party wanted to hold a grand rally here for the President.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers," but as a back-up, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test possibilities.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need to blindly trust the speed data of the providers. Customers can check themselves how much of it is actually achieved in case of abnormalities.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are an integral part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the consumer centre Bavaria.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests carried out by the providers are carried out according to vendor-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively", says the consumer centre Bavaria on their side to consider.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised performance. This is best done in writing by post.
If this does not affect even after multiple requests, customers can terminate and under certain circumstances also demand damages. However, if success fails, only the way to sue helps.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont has called for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being ascertained," Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken - an impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyi to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden for years.
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort about it. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump’s policies several times, for example, against easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the movies around Tom Holland should continue.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Several US media report this in agreement. According to this, the start of the cinema is already to be determined: In the USA, the film is to start on July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidey's path in the MCU continues. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring".
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel is said to have made an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, which also includes Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of Spider-Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has reached the grand finale in the USA. In the last episode, there were many happy endings and as many cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, were paid tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers to the series finale.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives showed the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his serving sentence.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was casually mentioned in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is heading towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit. Whether he has actually thrown a skirt over himself, the stunned Harvey wants to know about the bridegroom, only to note snippily: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Aegean Sea: Baby and four more children drown in boat crash
When a refugee boat capsized in the Aegean Sea, a baby and four other children drowned. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wanted to "inform himself in Turkey about the refugee situation", said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help cope with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson from the EU Commission confirmed Seehofer's planned trip with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusually large number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people moved to the Greek islands, according to the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in numbers has led to doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come to the Greek islands illegally via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take in a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side due to a lack of staff. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos have just under 29,400 people waiting for them. The worst situation is on Lesbos: 5,200 migrates are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016, there have been so many, reports the state radio.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate changes are "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time and led to more heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics are affected.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo panic
The leader of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Greens boss holds a reusable cup in her hand on a photo. But now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed after all. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Green Party, never held the reusable coffee cup with metal straw in her hand. On the party’s website she was on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a sloppy (papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss has to answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and the party of producing fake news in order to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection", in the middle of an election campaign for the Lower House election, in which Trudeau also has an increasing difficulty due to a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and started the discussion about fake news. A user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents in order to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and said on her blog that she didn’t know anything about this action. In order to underline this, she posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she put it right, was made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokesperson of the party said that it was only about placing the party logo in the picture, and not covering up anything. There is only one section of the photo on the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian, and at the same time asked herself something from her over-committed team: "If they want to work on a picture again, could they not do something to my face so that I look younger?"
The German Greens, too, came to Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - their pictures were not photoshopped. Katharina Schulze, the head of the Bavarian Greens, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: life-long flight ban at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng was promised an upgrade by Cathay Pacific via mail. However, when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Get a spontaneous upgrade for Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class for free.
This case shows, however, how one should not do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram follow Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30th she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the outbound flight, Jaqueline staff refused to upgrade, even though they showed an e-mail in which their Cathay Pacific allegedly offered an upgrade. The letter was sent to the influencer by a marketing employee of the airline, while the airline accused Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman showed the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at the airport JFK were skeptical: they checked with the headquarters. And in fact the employee from which the mail allegedly originated was supposed to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not show up.
Airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a life-long ban on Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (around 1,280 euros), she had to buy a new ticked flight to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Cathay had refunded her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed back the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. The terms and conditions of the airline also state that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now hires a lawyer.
Oil prices drop after report on ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar in a very short period of time on Friday afternoon. At last, one barrel (159 liters) of the Brent North Sea variety cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of an American West Texas Intermediate barrel (WTI) dropped by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
A report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen was the trigger for the price slide. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of the world’s oil production to a halt. The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had denounced the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, one can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Raw Materials Strategy Division at Saxo Bank of Bloomberg News Agency.
Oil prices thus continue its downward movement of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent nearly 65 dollars.
Bloomberg recently reported, on the basis of insiders, that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September was progressing faster than expected. According to this, the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Most recently, there were several press releases based on insiders who report on the rapid progress made by Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, in the repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning to publicize and avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after Iran's capture and the recently granted release on the way to leaving the port. The crew is now preparing to leave, while the ship is still anchored, shipping chief Erik Hånell informed the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the US announced that it would move defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian archenemy in Saudi Arabia. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and Great Britain had at times driven oil prices up significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump are intensifying
In the affair over possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, allegations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials have worked hard to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a controversial telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy at the end of July. An anonymous whistleblower explained this. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "cover-up". Trump spoke of a "witch hunt".
North Korea deems Trump and Kim's third summit to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be held in the nuclear dispute. Kim Kye-gwan, senior diplomat, said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA, the purpose and the prospects for success of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore.
The U.S. has done nothing to implement the summit's resolutions last year, said the advisor to the North Korean State Department. He also criticized intensified US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the U.S. and South Korea. However, he hopes for Trump's "wise" and "courage" decision so that it can be brought back together.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was supposed to bring before he was prepared to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both then met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the discussions, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers to help with mine clearance
The British Prince Harry in Angola has symbolically ignited and destroyed an explosive mine. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the site of Dirico he set up the ignition circuit. At a safe distance the explosive exploded. Looking at the goal of getting Angola free by 2025, he later demanded in front of running TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names stand on these weapons, but who did not help to get rid of them to commit themselves to help".
Pound under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British Pound under Pressure
In the face of an early reduction in interest rates, the pound loses its value against the euro.
Frankfurt Speculations on the Bank of England (BoE)’s early interest rate cuts are increasing the pound sterling. The British currency reduced by up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars on Friday.
The sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders. He brought forward a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was considered a champion of a restrictive monetary policy, analyst Ricardo Evangelista from the Broker House ActivTrades said.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy caused by the Brexit Hickhack without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement on 31 October, if necessary.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proved
Materials from the Moscow analysis laboratory are being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details of the Doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy the little credibility that the Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and only slightly. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the requested samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed, followed by the closure of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After an individual test, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes of the country flying the neutral flag at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, while at the February 2018 Winter Games there were 168 Russian athletes at the start. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer the World Cup with the host took place in Russia.
Positive findings missing
The following September, the Wada picked up the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the above samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory was manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We have noted numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower, and those that received it from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing, which were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup Not Affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The athletics association is the only organisation to hold on to Russia’s ban. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already placed manipulations in the room and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the re-blocking of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
