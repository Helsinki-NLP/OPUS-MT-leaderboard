No liberating amendment for Tymozhenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused to propose to abolish, as part of an amendment to the Criminal Code, the clause on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the liberation of the imprisoned ex-premier minister, was rejected by the MEPs at the second reading of the motion for a reduction in the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly negative contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, and the appeal of the convicted is to be brought to court in December.
Timoshenko himself described the verdict as political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial raised suspicion of the bias of the court.
The request to remove Section 365, on the basis of which the ex-premier minister was sentenced, from the penal code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners have to be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council professed the customary right of Shar'a, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft, you chop off your hand.
Women, too, should quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, any religious apostates will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in future be united by the Koran out of opposing tribes.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would hardly be conceivable in this country and above all hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively seen probably not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
From this point of view, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters let themselves be helped at all by the unbelieving dogs.
To their excuse, it may be only the fact that NATO's airstrikes were not directed by any General from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a firefight, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage whatsoever.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
Thus, the locals are rid of a worry - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But does the oil companies get the black gold at a mocking price even without occupation?
Hardly, and so the West can at long last boast of its unselfishness in the protection of human rights.
If this does not spoil the Shar'a representatives for them.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm low blew through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, with Germany and France increasing.
But the bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors are keeping an eye not only on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, and France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of forecast 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only referred to stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Statistical Office, the trend towards a slowdown in economic performance was thus confirmed.
So the results are worse than the analysts' predictions.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the eurozone as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The 10-year government bond yield climbed to 28.45%.
The yield on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany there are voices that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
She won 1-0 in Montenegro thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goalkeeper of Petr Jiráček.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotion game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge amount of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won 1-0 thanks to the closing weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus redeemed their ticket for the Football Championship.
Also because of the precise defence game of the Czech team they could put the Montenegrins under more pressure only in the second half.
The pitch birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two huge chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will participate in the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that local football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes on, quite militant football was played.
Both teams combined tediously and so was played mainly around the middle line.
Even in the second half, the pressure of the home team remained out, and the large cuts before the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defenses.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object at noon Tuesday and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Isfahan, Iran, formed a living sign on Tuesday around the core technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to make it clear that they are willing to protect their country's core program, even with their own lives, if necessary.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran seems to have long since abandoned its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
At noon, students prayed in front of the entrance to the complex and then declared death to the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack intended to paralyse Iran's nuclear program, the Israeli press says that the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's target would also be from the centre in Isfahan.
A Fatty Child’s Menu: It Does Not Breakfast and Eat Sausage for Dinner
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the environment in which a person grows up and is the example that surrounds him is for the healthy development of a person.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families in which normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner the day before the educational campaign under the motto "Adiposity is not a coincidence".
In families with fat children, sport is also not one of the favourite activities, which also affects the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 Children
The survey took place at the end of the school year last year, with almost 900 children from primary schools in the whole of the Czech Republic being interviewed.
This was already the second year of the "Adiposity is not a coincidence" campaign, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are decisive factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, said eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper dinner five times a day - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," one of the survey results says.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the pupils' families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast for themselves.
Worst of all was the statement that one in ten families does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey test revealed that in the families of overweight children, unhealthy fries are often consumed.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed exercise, only less than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to assemble their own meal plan from the possibilities offered by appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many pastries, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades", is emphasized in the final report to this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main dish, pasta won just before poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was also very low.
Returning to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In many cases, there has been a marked shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition in the control group of the survey participants who completed the questionnaire after completing the enlightening lecture "Adiposity is not a coincidence", the results of the project are quoted.
This was obvious, for example, with the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed poultry or fish much more often as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to learn stylists, I had a bit moaned that this was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
I didn't know in the least what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" works.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the examination gets, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with director Alena (not a single man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideal proportioned figure.
And that's what most of us are.
Some have a short neck, others have too young a figure without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to optically cover wide shoulders, extend the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a female type like Jennifer Lopez - with a big bust, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure-hugging, without her being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or trousers really don't fit, you should at least have a piece tailored.
Surely you will not regret this, because well - seated clothing is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt, you feel much better than in one of the bars that keeps getting up and down, standing down at the waist, etc.
Young figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, brooms, applications, embroidery or ruffle.
With this amount of information and figure types, I'm glad I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid that it's almost impossible to do it in the face of the assigned homework.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity, for which she was supposed to create suitable outfits - daywear and evening robe.
In doing so, we should take into account the current look, fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to put on Miranda Kerr, whom you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
On the inside, I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than to wear Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, for example, who has probably increased to a hundred kilos in recent times (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the clothes from magazines or search the Internet, print them out and then graphically edit them.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also shapes the so-called product page in the journals (according to concrete specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And sent in stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in a very different way.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or collar and immediately the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But most of all, the following advice came to mind: "First, you must know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," Jakub said.
At last I realize why we have to timpani all these teaching sentences, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see quite different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to reckon with all this in the design of the outfit.
Jan Pokorný also confirmed that image and styl sometimes make up half of the success.
You just need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from which image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities often consider this to be thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is secondary).
And if one of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us to a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then all you need to do is Google, to find out for sure that the tabloid press writes that the corresponding celebrity has returned to or lost, etc.
On Sunday Jan and Mario encouraged us not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then to "build" the outfit.
In his work, he must first of all communicate with the people he styled and he must be a smart psychologist.
To judge people without bending and standing up to his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and add some pretty pieces, then we can't clean out the whole closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can contribute," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So a bag that you button at the waist and carry with you all the necessary proprieties.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, hair-removing dispensers or safety pins, it also contains utensils such as a nylon thread (to help the stylist photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothing is gathered in the back if it is too large (pins or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and, of course, sewing tools.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something out in practice, we learned how to glue shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let alone the outside.
We were stuck and glued...
The scissors must not even touch the shoes, so that they are not damaged.
So you really have to be clever.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuing course.
One thing has become clear to me - to devote yourself to styling on a professional level is not a child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree journey is made by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant errors for routine travel to the early shift.
Although it succeeded in fulfilling the ambitions to a large extent, what good is that, if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
He promised to move the already old game series "Need for Speed" into a new dimension again and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the fitting passages in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you're used to at NFS, in the end a lot is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially there are quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is reduced by some superfluous mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So there are actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
First of all, one is introduced to history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit on the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't have the impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the drive through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape looks visually very pleasant.
Every now and then untypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts sight.
In the mountains, on the other hand, one has to watch out in hell that one is not buried by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in a row.
Only a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police also interfere, which wants to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages where Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less passages in the game than one would expect (perhaps only three).
In the end, this is more of a benefit to the matter, because this element at least has no chance of getting bored - it belongs to the elements mentioned above in the context that make the game more varied.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, it does not tear out trees, but on the other hand it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model continues to do quite well for action-packed racing, although one could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything will be fine.
Real problems only appear after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK.
It is hardly to be expected from a game of this kind that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea before impact on any object how the car behaves, then obviously everything is not okay.
Typical example: In the narrow overtaking or passing of oncoming cars one "strips" in some places the other car only slightly, in other, almost identical situation one comes into the sling and turns wild pirouettes.
Or you're about to scrap the car.
Thanks to the Restart system, it doesn't matter, it's always annoying.
The restarts are solved like this: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last clue of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five reparts.
Once you've exhausted it, everything starts from the beginning.
So the Restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't succeed, but you shouldn't rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even the rest kind does not help, there is nothing else but to learn the critical section from the head.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to be driven through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere, you always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration at the appropriate point, whether you are the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent is passing by two oncoming cars in front of you, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed in such a way that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where one is always overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
This is the craziest way to complete the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to get you out of here on devils.
And if he's in front of you, then of course he takes the view, so that you drive your own car a few times in Klump.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly spoils the joy of the game.
And that's a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is generally quite entertaining and sometimes so action-packed that you almost don't know where your head is.
And in principle it doesn't matter what is "guilty" about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change in the course of the races.
One must not overlook the gas stations on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient, which you have right now.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
The task mode (challenges) also goes hand in hand with the mode of game history - i.e. the races in the individual locations that are known from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, various items must be opened up: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected with the online function Autolog, which compares among other things its own achieved results with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come by car into a subway tunnel (because of me), where you race in the dark on the rails long (because of me).
On the speedometer numbers look between 150 a 200 km/h (because of me), but suddenly a subway comes from behind and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial office we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
All the more annoying is that at some exciting moments the refresh rate is slowing down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents involving a greater number of people, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is ok and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to address as wide a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack was created a lá "something from everyone" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game wasn't reduced by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned above, we could have said with the boob tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems kind of unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared for these mistakes to catch your eye with the power of airport lights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has put the balance between the various institutions out of hand."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth out and everyone to get used to their new role," said Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, who began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her lecture, she showed how seriously she takes the motto "Comprehensibly and openly about Europe", in which she succeeded in describing the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and comprehensible way that she could have envied many lecturers of the Faculty of Law at Karlsuniversität.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that he was too inconspicuous - a grey official who couldn't handle such a role, but I have to say that it took everyone's breath away as well as he did.
"He is a person who can patiently listen to and communicate with twenty-seven member states and, above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? Which number should I call?", thus as an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policies towards states such as China or India.
No one wants us to ban our oil cap quargels
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and had also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the government's case during the Presidency as a major negative which had seriously harmed the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently fully involved.
In the words of the Ambassador, not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, has been quite hectic.
And the EU's seven-year budget needs to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and economical budget, which sectors of the economy will receive priority, which countries will receive more and which countries will receive less support - all this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe".
"If I don't like something, it's grey abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
As a citizen, how am I supposed to know whether we really want to crumble in Brussels or think of round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether someone really wants to ban us from the quarges?
She would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics, who perceive more the negative than the positive side of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and is close to a Slovak, then the Frenchman next to me means, "Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and doing that makes a pretty sour face.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU expects in future, above all, tough rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
As much more real, as a "European federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"Here we have the countries of the eurozone and the countries away from the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Reinforced Cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want to work together, and those who do not want to, should stand quietly apart."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately amounts to a strong "Europe of different speeds", says Vicenová.
In this regard, it also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to search for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy most accurately, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution; it is known as a modern company, although a century has passed since it was founded.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by their first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He was already the slogan that countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a trademark for the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was already published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope that we will achieve even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Well-thought-out system
In the 1930s, Watson had been taking care of his employees in a similar way to that of the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid leave as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well thought-out pay system for the best newer and merchant.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are just as sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion right from the start - as one of the first companies in the world IBM abolished any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will replace at the head of IBM next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, and so far she has taken on the position of Sales, Marketing and Strategy Manager.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, the company employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, it is a difference to be present in the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - called "Big Blue" in the states of its logo because of its family, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or diskettes.
With about 220 billion dollars of market value (market capitalization), IBM was the second largest technology company this year (just after Apple), with Microsoft being overtaken for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of today's customers - unfortunate were for example the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on forward movement, so you must not commit emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, they also leave again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM's profits are largely accounted for by services, software and hardware, each accounting for one fifth of the total.
In 1990 hardware was still the most represented with more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-disposal assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment volume in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM survives today's crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the company's net profit continues to grow.
IBM's corporate slogan is: everything can be changed - only the values can't be changed.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also be able to cope with the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutters to spaceflights
Founded a hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later IBM company was the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous clocks for the registration of the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairman of the board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader even shaded IBM's founders - Watson's ideas are still based on the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began producing and selling all kinds of machinery for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to cash registers.
In the first four decades Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, engineers and computers from IBM helped NASA to conduct flights into space - Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, man's famous flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of that time, came into the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus entered fully into the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the concept of "Smart Planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and in the city administration.
In the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the Smart Commerce platform to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM established a branch in Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at all.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central Office for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here is also a top research team of world level that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová on her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become her lover from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the next life it has set itself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered the singer I. Bartošová refuge in her own house, she probably wouldn't even have imagined how this would end with her husband.
When Iveta moved back and forth after 30 days at her urging, Josef went with him.
Yes, he confessed publicly that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, even it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile herself with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with
If Rychtář Iveta should leave Bartošová in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties", revealed Mrs. Rychtářová; but she also said that she has already separated emotionally from him and insists on mutual decency alone.
Joseph wears the fact that Darina has locked the back door for him with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"I'm talking to Darina normally, we just don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the paper) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he does not want to stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take over any responsibility.
The worst female abusers, what about you?
If you ask the men to name some typical female abusers, they shake some out of their sleeves without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines, in which we let pass a few misdemeanours revue, which let the men flow the blood in the veins?
Shopping addiction
Does their husband accuse them of being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one hader a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a bit more for promotions?
Then I guess your case is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping appetite halfway under control.
But hand on heart, which woman can do it already, in the search for a well-fitting outerwear only so to stroll through a clothing store and not immediately try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told her husband - you better stay outside...
Constant discontent
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Does that look familiar to you?
Yeah?
Then I guess you're one of the women who's really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to let go, but many men are allergic to it when your wife is constantly complaining about her appearance.
The stronger gender is agreed - with the increasing frequency of the complaints, women are becoming more and more incompatible.
Order and cleanliness first
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Are you insulting your partner because he tramples on the clean tiles with dirty shoes again, you scolded the children, because the just scrubbed sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that order and cleanliness in family life do not come first.
This immodest sense of purity can ultimately also harm mutual relationships and, above all, family peace.
Stitching
"Dirty gym pants come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put those old socks on again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that this will put him on the palm tree.
Of course that's not a bad idea, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not have had to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, because behind their backs is cuddled or even slandered or one forges alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to hack through such topics as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
I think each of us women has a little bit of harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hand on heart - this is probably all women's.
But this is not to be confused with gossipants of the grossest caliber, to whom nothing and no one is holy, who despise everyone in their environment and which pose a considerable danger especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
Jaromír Jágr, who played in the NHL's Monday match, was a major player in the NHL's 5–3 victory in the NHL's first round of the season.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was declared the best player of the match, was the beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star.
Jágr's fellow player Jakub Voráček also recorded two assistants in the same game.
After the match, Jágr told journalists that he had predicted Giroux a big evening.
"Even before the game, I'll tell him he's doing a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that way."
"A feeling like this comes over again and again," Jágr explained, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the puck behind the Hurricanes' goal and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander one second before the whistle of the first third, but the second third then belonged to the Flyers again.
More specifically, Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr he scored his third goal, then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but I'm sure he's one of the best three," Jágr praised his center.
"I wouldn't have thought of playing with an ice hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm so happy."
"I'm cutting my game towards me."
"All these years in the NHL, my fellow players set their game on me and now the pike turns around," Jágr smiled.
Carolina turned the game into a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was in excess of two against one successful.
"Excellently, Pronger was still operating in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
This victory led Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defenceman of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured Buffalo in the game and retired in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens lost their lead in Penalty-shooting 2:3 in addition to their Beck experience.
Tomáš Plekanec could not turn one of the sentences.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team probably the high illness-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defense players to the end.
"That's bad."
"We only ended the encounter with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"With each change one attack wave after another and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and taken the puck out of our third."
There were reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec fought thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters were involved.
Travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five state travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, sporturist, CKM, recrea and autoturist.
At that time the travel agencies sold mainly only trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, to the West at that time only selected ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If, for example, a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies offered trips to the West, but then one had to accept huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even that was not the way things were going.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge - the condition for a departure to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to obtain the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange commitment.
Therefore, the vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and daches - a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad last year in countries around the world.
A huge paradox that one is no longer aware of today is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, foreign exchange obligations were abolished in neighbouring Western European countries, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their journeys to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
For example, the Czech vacationers slept in the tent in the park while travelling to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at the time.
A typical feature of trips abroad from Czechs was a trunk packed with canned food, beer and sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to purchase the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and, as a result, the average salaries rose, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997 travel agencies began to prepare regularly for travel by charter flights, making air travel incredibly cheaper compared to the past thanks to the possibility to negotiate volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the US, had already made moneyless payments with all the world's highly developed countries, making travelling even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-official" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was handled - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying to far-off sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another important moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the world's highly developed countries.
In 2008, for the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 thousand per capita on a single holiday, including the costs at the resort.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has no chairman, and the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
To date, there has been no agreement on which electoral order should be elected.
And without this, no vote is possible at all on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his role, calling on his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old querels broke out again between the two federation chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly evident on 16 September when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the Volkshaus in the Prague district of Smíchov for nothing, because the negotiations did not lead to any result and it was not only about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote at the full assembly - only the statutory representatives or also the functionaries equipped with a power of attorney.
On this only point, agreement was reached at least in part, to which the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law contributed, whose opinion was that representation on a proxy basis was not acceptable.
However, disputes over the electoral system continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring any more clarity into the matter, at whose meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, there is in principle nothing else on the agenda at all.
Even if the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how should one proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the Articles of Association or whether a completely different model needs to be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the Chamber for whom he is running wins.
Moravia is allegedly prepared to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage counting.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer have any sense at all, this mode would question the entire bicameral concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would be best not to bend the electoral order, but to choose according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even though it appears that the statutory electoral order is most likely to meet Pelta from all candidates.
"My wish is that as much as possible be elected according to the statutes."
"So that no nonsensical alternative options can be devised, as at the last general meeting," declared the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who ran for the first time and distinguished himself from Pelta in his statements.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly contribute to calming the moods."
"When football first rides on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says Jablonec's official, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "justify" the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a further blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense will ultimately prevail," said Rajchl.
Only - there is not much time left to agree on all sides.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generality will be complete until the qualifying match.
The charter plane, with which among others Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical disturbance and so one searched feverishly for a substitute variant, as one still brings a part of the executive committee to the location of the Barrage-Hinspiel.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, is probably crucial.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have led the divided parties within the largest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will point the Czech sport in a new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the struggle for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers, could have made up a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the football association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have entered the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from getting to the head of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he intends to serve as Chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman he would have liked to see an experienced top manager, who is not too involved in the football event.
"I spoke to a few people in question in person."
"It's hard to believe that some told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation, who is regarded as a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should hold the position of Chairman.
"With his victory, today's state would be preserved and Czech football would not go ahead at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever business man, would be twice as bad for football," Paclík emphasized.
He also points to the fact that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone interceptions for the investigation in a corruption affair, but from which Pelta emerged without penalty.
"I don't know what prestige a victory from Pelta should bring to (ch.) football."
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who saw his earlier statement that "he would sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta became chairman", but already a little more relaxed.
However, if Paclík were to win in the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Likewise, another candidate - Rajchl, who Paclík supported before the October Annual General Meeting, ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's capable of running the association as manager."
"I'm not stuck in matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who caused a stir in September, replacing Dagmar Damková, who was in charge of the dismissal of the referee commission with Luōk Macela.
Paclík himself claims to have grown to be the president of the association.
And he relies on his skills in the management of private companies, and since last summer he has also been head of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which degenerates into vile situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy to, for example, Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders for more money flowing from the lottery tax to sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote himself to."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their reasoning, but they also have to say clearly where the money goes," he said.
Paclík does not regard his connection to the Pilsner club as a handicap either, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta, on the other hand, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense for me to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík made clear.
Pelta promised new FAČR statutes, which would result in a stalemate situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairperson's office, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would make a stand for the FAČR to receive new statutes, which in future would rule out disputes about the electoral rules from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse itself in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and the acquisition of funding if he was elected.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so the two-month break might help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was run by someone, says the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonecer Club, but who also worked for Sparta and the Executive Committee for many years.
This is also why he believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed in Ivan Hašek's time is responsible for today's problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, the Annual General Meeting in June approved articles of association that were not as perfect as all had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the citizens' association that he used as a lure for the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take it personally and be willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a matter of principle without which he cannot be," says Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to distinguish himself from his opponents.
Earlier, he had announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he acknowledged because of his legal education, and he knew well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"However, his attacks were disparaging and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's why many people now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed to his opponent, who probably remains true to his proclamations that he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest leagues to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the aftermath of the corruption scandal of last year."
"Right after that, I would plunge into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean staff cleaning.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, there is understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If really the only controversial point should be how to vote in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only win it back if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former Deputy Chairman Jindřich Rajchl was elected as the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would probably spoil the mood of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that if he chooses, he will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and blame the members of the executive committee for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and otherwise continue the work begun by former president Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to performance football for young people."
"I don't mean to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I would therefore like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football progresses with miles in every segment."
Many would not be delighted about this, because instead of criticizing others' work, they would have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it had been considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me who don't keep throwing clubs between my legs and questioning every step I take," he said in explaining why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would."
"That's trust you can't lose," he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a big piece of work and I don't want to throw that away."
"Processes have been launched, which probably only come to light in a few years and I would hate to see someone stop them," he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him are above all people who would make football so that it would only be there for the chosen ones."
I can be blamed for a few things, but not for being partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is fine and not just the chosen one," Rajchl noted.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, each of which won the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík has joined the struggle for the function of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I have strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and now realizes that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of kroner for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not pull a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the start to give Czech football new confidence", he considers the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"Should he be elected, he would probably continue to do the things Ivan Hašek has initiated and would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions."
He would certainly not want to bend things in his favor," Rajchl judges over his rival.
Europe’s most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
A paddling pool in Ufo-Optik, Pränkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike the tired legs in bubble baths rest.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past one and a half years, one thing could not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on the water, she gazed high in artistically designed domes, she swam towards marble turkeys waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored art nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she took it up in her notebook - with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
In this way, architecture historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools - and now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She took her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" through 13 countries: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to do with sports, Meder says - only in the water this is different.
The only annoying thing is that swimmers have to settle for themselves with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can inhale the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird chirping in the park.
"I asked myself one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Vienna-based Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Splatter in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so big because all the senses are served, Meder says.
And if the builders have tried hard, swimming halls can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
"On the one hand it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything visually doubles: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" conveys interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness havens on 190 pages - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens in her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found a nitrate-containing water in a rustic karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: while the Zurich roof bath has the whole city in mind, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the hustle and bustle on the ski slope.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open bowls it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the pool collector Meder get the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so much of heating oil that one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing medicinal water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to the skin as soon as you slip into the pelvis - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a restricted terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds grow between the tiles.
On the other hand, one has counteracted the decay in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already been completed by this bath; one can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to merge so different architectural styles into such a great unit," Meder says.
With such a palace the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only secondary matter.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank Investigates Raw Materials Business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the CEO then wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For German citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions step out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges drive up prices - and the banks therefore bear a share of the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aimed at Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley operate in a similar way.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann reacted to the criticism: He promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was "worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations made in the Foodwatch report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank - including a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the head of the bank then wants to tell us what consequences it will have.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann tinkers at his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatically how ruthlessly banks today damage the general good."
Ackermann, as the top bank lobbyist, is now particularly committed.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio where money is used to wager on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is about people suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the Group CEO wants to give a perfect picture just a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not change to the Supervisory Board unlike planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to care - that would eventually have to do with his successor.
Any second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey, for which the Institute Forsa surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just eleven percent therefore believe that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: According to the survey, one in two would terminate all investments in which money flows into the commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances against such a bank, 49 percent said to think about quitting their account and moving to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy endings: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disappeared.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture is enthralled by clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and famous example of the Brüssler World Exhibition 1958.
At that time, Schwecker's pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion at the next World Exhibition in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like annex in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
After the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden, the pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was set up by the Vienna Südbahnhof, rebuilt and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20er Haus" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art was given a new home in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has completed the new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, an art historian with a considerable career, among other things, in her youth as an ice skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, implemented the conversion strongly among politicians and conservationists, raised public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookshop should be there, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna with Schwanzer and the pavilion was for him a "unfortunately important place" where he had watched the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and its conversion.
There were far greater problems with the current reconstruction: the building was "an energy spin", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fibre-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered light ditch between house and street ensures the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust protection shade.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and renovations, the building has remained flexible and light.
It had been difficult with the pavilion "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because a lucky urban development case has occurred: The completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings, is being created around the Swiss Garden.
And another stroke of luck might happen: The 21er Haus could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
Rail plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has worked out a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance on the basis of an internal crisis plan that investments of a total of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
The aim was to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks, even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, a doubling of internal and external employees for snow removal on railway systems and platforms to 16,000 people is planned.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary turnouts.
Two months ago, after a summit meeting with government and industry, railway chief Rüdiger Grube had warned against train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, the railways had considerable problems in passenger transport, as they lacked, among other things, reserves in difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
For years, the railway has also been making it possible for it to have axles of ICE trains tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE at Cologne Central Station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank Pays Millions of Punishment in the USA
After the turmoil around Chief Josef Ackermann, new trouble comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million dollars there.
As if the problems at home for Deutsche Bank were not enough, the industry giants now also catch up with their past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes about the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of having misled the cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks into the depths.
"We are satisfied that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank admitted no guilt with the settlement.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to the payment of 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA president Debbie Matz welcomed the two money houses' approach.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US cooperative banks and intervenes in default to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the billion-dollar damages that have been caused.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also taken other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a disaster for a large number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even though events have been going on for a few years, there is currently a sharp wind blowing towards the banks in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried countless lawsuits to obtain redress or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having taken advantage of two US state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage deals worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit from FHFA, which deals with several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand up for "substantial losses", without, however, mentioning an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased more than $10 billion worth of shares.
So far, the major American investor Warren Buffett had always stated that he would not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies could be poorly predicted.
However, he had now read IBM's annual reports and changed his mind about investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily providing services and providing computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, IBM is now allowed to call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett now revealed in the US business channel CNBC that he had bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had ensured proper profits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has been relying for some time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until now.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett accessed a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineer.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway has around 80 own subsidiaries and shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and developed it with clever investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his life - style is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
Following the announcement of the Buffett investment, IBM's share rose by one percent on a pre-exchange basis.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and one Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a far-right background.
This news is being addressed with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, a ghost long believed to be dead is returning: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
Nevertheless, the fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the exposed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Does the bloody ideology revive?" headlined the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted calmly: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors the togetherness had been staged - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media seems like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which talks about the background of the murder series.
Nor can the German edition of the "Hürriyet" be taken away from drawing this intellectual connection.
"It's starting to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the police's actions and their subsequent search success are extremely critically discussed.
The authors wonder why the German authorities had not come up with the idea of searching for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some people are at least rhetorically prepared to use drastic means: "If we continue to shame here, the migrants have no choice but to defend themselves and to arm themselves."
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"On the goodness of the enlightenment and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network, inner peace in Germany depends very much," writes "Selen".
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, was illustrated by the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of us on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was particularly criticised: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the attack by Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech at the time how many taxes the local Turks made.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated by the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the rule of law has been since then.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive investigation and reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since moved from one crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge it.
Axel Weber certainly didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would start an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its new solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But already in September it became clear that everything would come quite differently.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and screwed up around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been regarded as a victim - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the Chairmanship of the Board of Directors already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, he is a professor of economics and a central banker, and certainly would have needed a training period.
With one blow, he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven once again that it has long since earned the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
On the one hand, UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand, it has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She combined the image of the secretive and solid but also lavished Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very big number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money-rich customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, former banker and later long-time bank professor in Zurich, explains: "At that time, I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, how could I be so wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something went wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then had been regarded as a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, they suspected why he had left.
The bank's investment division had gambled with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs.
For this she actually found investors, however, which some until shortly before would have blown her nose: an intransparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund, which was so secreted that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, Chairman Marcel Ospel, the second-best-paid Swiss Board of Directors in 2006, resigned.
The disaster followed in October 2008: In view of their misinvestments in the financial crisis, UBS was facing collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, while the Swiss Confederation gave six billion Swiss francs for a compulsory convertible bond, which enabled it to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks.
Finally, UBS’s balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times as large as Switzerland’s economic performance (see chart).
"Once again, we couldn't save UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first catastrophe was followed by the second.
Just a few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who might have been behind taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it agreed to pay $780 million to repay unwarranted profits from these transactions, including fines.
In this way, UBS more or less openly confessed to helping with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both key business areas: in investment banking through misspeculation and asset management through help with tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter, just as one thought, now the UBS will be able to do it again, this unfortunate dealer story follows: A single dealer gambles 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it turns out that risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been noted that there has been too little change in risk control," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it does not control risk control."
But it was exactly the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago begun to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: not too big risks, but security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic might the world collapse.
The vaults of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank - it's just a bit bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank is headquartered on Züricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main railway station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception room of UBS is accessed through a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are marble-clad, in front are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
Both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however, have replaced this idea at some point - or betrayed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two large banks.
UBS had become far too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say there.
"And if they do, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, gave it high profits, and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost as much money as the Swiss major bank in the subprime jungle.
On 15 October 2008 the disaster became visible.
"That Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided on the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion Swiss francs or around 45 billion euros were granted by the politicians to save the large bank facing bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss major banks joined forces to form a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for little Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
In doing so, it helped the two different predecessor banks of UBS to complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came to a great deal of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked up from the bank theory to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear, there was a feeling of exuberance before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, on which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs push off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, to the top.
A few steps were already successful.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, she played at the top.
Business consultants, however, who were commissioned, highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge gap with the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that packed and passed securities on to American mortgage loans - but also retained risks itself.
Even when other banks were long looking for the exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than expected.
Positions at UBS became the spin seat and are shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
It must find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: stop investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is supposed to run UBS's business permanently, the Zurich bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti plans to bring the investment bank back to its mid-1990s level.
3500 places he'll paint.
That won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber will surely be asking himself now.
So far, he has only publicly said that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock exchanges
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without force.
The throttled industrial production on the continent suffocated hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass last week was still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems came to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all financial values were on the sales notes.
The Dow Jones index of default values at the close of trading was 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
During the course of trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax bid farewell with a minus of 1.2 percent with 5985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced production and is facing the end of the upswing.
Businesses produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
The US investors were sceptical: "We are not an island, we are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe would not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there would also be further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
He therefore felt that it was too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the pile and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and had it listed at first just under one percent higher against the trend in the course of trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
At 2.6 percent, shares of the Bank of America declined significantly more than the market.
The house silvers almost the entire rest of its shares in China Construction Bank and pays $6,6 billion for it.
With the net profit from the business, the institution wants to cushion its capital ratio and thus comply with tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share won 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 777 long-haul aircraft on Sunday and estimated the value of the order at $18 billion.
Including options for another 20 machines, the volume is as high as 26 billion dollars.
On the New York Stock Exchange, approximately 710 million shares were transferred to the owner.
719 values increased, 2281 fell and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares accounted for 630 in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 unchanged.
Smart crows spread to cities
In many places seed crows are regarded as "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, according to experts.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, local residents are amassing complaints about the dirt and noise of animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Experts at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian void said that it was impossible to get seed crows out of the cities.
There, experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
You are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the specially protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys the traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and falling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district had provided negative headlines.
Critics had described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the killing with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the burial, does nothing", the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver determined from Leer.
Spraying away nests with water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals escape, large colonies split up and spread elsewhere."
It is only conceivable to bury them as an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of animals from sensitive living areas and lure offers is conceivable in order to resettle them elsewhere.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens promoted "information boards instead of chainsaws" for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "After all, we can best bear a pimple on our face confidently."
Jürgens had co-founded the Aschenberger Krähen-Lehrpfad in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the birds' noise: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use tools to get a treat, but even make their own tools as tools.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed crows how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to bring a scaffold to collapse in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the clever crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a cylinder positioned vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had put wire pieces on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even managed to do so at once.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup failed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland are present at the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Leaded by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive European Championship participation perfect after the 0:0.
The Czechs reached a 1-0 (0:0) in the play-off-back match with outsider Montenegro, after the play-off (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia had nothing left to burn in the 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland took a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trading meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup playoffs in South Africa against Portugal.
Portugal took a tailor-made start in the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo chased a free kick out of about 30 meters to the early lead into the meshes.
A good quarter of an hour later Nani showed his long shot qualities and hit the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goal hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburg from the English leader Manchester City put a headball on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
After that, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian prison, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the Vice-European Champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the European Champion of 1976 has taken to the European Championship.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to survive a terrible second already in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Cech prevented a possible goal by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot just past the goal of Cech in the 40th minute from the turn of the penalty area limit.
After the break the cross bar had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of the FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to clear his place on the bench of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a final round.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
Selcuk Inan only hit the pole in the seventh minute with a distance shot, assailant Kazim Kazim could not sink the bouncer in the goal either.
However, after the moment of shock, Croatia became more and more in control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made his place for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute onwards, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bavaria Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni goes to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute with the 4-0 victory in the final.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) was the same for the guests.
Ireland pushed the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment the Estonian back team prevented the possible lead hit.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an accident in defence of finisher Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to 1-0 across the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer, SAP, is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
The Dax Group announced on Tuesday that around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) will flow by 2015.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit employees accordingly," announced Co-Chef Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP is currently present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers are located in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
At present, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is almost rarely done before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to support sustainable growth in China through comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Terror. A Story of the First World War, narrated in nineteen destinies" begins with a long list of main characters that goes to your heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic narrative, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when, like Englund's men and women, you are lost in the mist of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he does not incorrectly describe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is not a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is about "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flickers up like the votive candles in a church, some come in while others go out.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war of positions on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Terror" wanders with expert view over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells like Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance.
Who's coming, anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged.
"Failing facts," says Englund, "have been topped up with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or poignant, but they are extremely alive in Englund's collection of small moments lost in detail.
Many of them are talking about lack and helping themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, fake eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and last served with a fake bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes lined with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to wildness and says about the war: "One feels that despite everything that was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and to pretend that such a facade means civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind his own strong and foggy shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die and will not take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you refrain from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who has been hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word skillful and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a tailor-made suit that kills while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there is as much frivolous behavior as there is heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a venereal disease in order to escape the frontal service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and greased themselves on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, resulting in them being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Peter Graves' Swedish, Englund's poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "uncontrollable forces unleashed in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I have ever read of in a non-fiction book.
I won't give it back.
But it's like with his book, he grabbed this page with the main characters in front of us and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep, a minute planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there were hardly any people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. Everyone else initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police president Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the squatters an enormous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster drill had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials stepped up the so-called chaos training - counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, what a declaration as "exercise" said.
"The few police officers involved, to my knowledge, did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned about these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including operational commandos from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter and go out in the park, almost like commuters, so 1:00 a.m. at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do so when the smallest number of people are in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before the departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages booming from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left the place.
The police said that no tents would be touched until 1:45 to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police president, said that this had happened for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they were trying to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the officials were very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
When the police moved to the west through the big mess of the protesters' personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, which picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared a short time later on the Internet.
A main centre of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied up to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officers were called to cut them loose.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
According to the police, the evacuation was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, as he said, were due to "indecent conduct and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the police department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were supposed to access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were built on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, one block further south.
It could be observed how from these locations the police extended the perimeter further and further around Zuccotti Park.
In one place it was observed that several officials, many of them with protective signs, drove people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern radius.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of supervisors will file lawsuits against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school supervisors who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last opportunity open to the union, District Council 37, in their efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the worst paid employees in the city and had lost their jobs in a move on 7 October, described the union leaders as political revenge for refusing access to a health fund maintained by the working groups last year to fill the household gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the city council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the redundancies had been part of the budget, that they had passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that there was nothing specific in the budget that staff members of the school aid would be dismissed.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Department of Education about a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city's Ministry of Education as defendants and eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in charge of the lawsuit and that their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a bill of complaint submitted by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies at schools in the poor neighborhoods of the city to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
She explains that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn have lost and 46 helpers in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx have been released.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighbourhood of bereaved parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for every poor school enrolment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo authorising the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, even if "excess" in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," says the bill of action.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's International Relations Committee will adopt a resolution under the authority of Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and US troops for their "mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of two parties' support for their democratic efforts."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators from both parties and the White House argued about the choice of words for a series of resolutions approving or disapproving the role of the US military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the restricted use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law passed in the Senate. Moreover, the Chamber overruled a decision to cut money for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission became a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that was angry enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not angry enough to pull the ground from under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and exceptional perseverance in their self-liberation" and "congratulates the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive the full support of the Foreign Relations Committee or will they divide the legislators, as the June law did?
The last version is opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top republican.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Republican and some Democrats Congressional legislature.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or any other area that is currently being voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried so far unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have tried often enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to both Congress and Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners in the Republicans who want to polish up their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the limitation to two terms of office of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among same-sex couples is a recurring template, as is a change that prohibits flag burning.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eager as the members propose changes, they move as unevenly faster than in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators submitted 77 such amendments.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Bound, but not defeated," Giffords said in the first TV interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from a distance during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night. She sang alone for the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she wrestled for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly give her voice to the debt brake.
In her first TV interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour 20/20 special that was recorded shortly before the couple's new book was published: "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The Special has been following Gifford's recovery since the 8 January assassination.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with the head.
A twitch with the lips.
And then, her first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: one sees the congressman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours with therapy every day, said that she could not remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that on March 12, he had read an article to Giffords from a newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
Suspicious shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forcibly medically treated while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated," said Kelly.
You just got hit.
And you're gonna get through this, and you're gonna recover, and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, who was observed, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really it wasn't.
The glaring contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are heaped with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, say servants.
The public increasingly behaves as if people were suffering in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way of support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that was inflicting on returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, talks take place about compassion in the silent and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe because they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there was a "happy, violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a high-ranking state post in Washington upon his return.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the surveyors subtly asked whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
"If you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of military lightness is partly rooted in the Americans' lack of interest in war.
Performances on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely usual during World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-infringement rape before the military court.
If this does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs will be ready for the next hearing.
Senior Private Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan wiped out her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit that they have brought against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not act against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., filed the lawsuit initially comprised 17 plaintiffs who, however, rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn or provide appropriate jurisdiction according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, because the problem is starting there.
"The military is hierarchically structured," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February, she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss the lawsuit.
The files of the court, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or previous soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document says.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 female soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It is time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three other lawsuits besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for alleged promotion of a woman-hostile atmosphere.
Independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America collects a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received to release them from service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration (the Administration of War Veterans) in which she accused her discriminatory practices in dealing with benefit claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were independently presented to Congress by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which offer a number of clues.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported, according to the Ministry of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the recorded cases were brought to court in the military, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, and during the hearing, she was asked about the sex she had before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember well the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the labors would start. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward, and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably released, so she received no support.
Whether the lawsuit Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine all my life.
The military lags behind a decade because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence as liability.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff's attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms come about," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed an amok run in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from being alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time on his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on the side of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it wasn't difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hideaway of personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the page's advertising tool to precisely define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of extreme right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with add-ons, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking for their educational level, their attitude towards violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 highly right-wing parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a rather new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online supporters of right-wing extremist groups are mostly young, male and annoyed about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this page you can study people you usually can't reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first, and it would never have allowed them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, it's all gone - you go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their drunkenness on Facebook are significantly more prone to drinking problems than students who were silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, for example residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population.
The page's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a National Lucky Index (mainly used data that only Facebook has access to - Masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make their large data resource accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to display its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey that they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the entries in a user profile and posts are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social - and a lot of social life is still happening offline."
"Cold and Inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears in a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who has been standing in two amok runs, in which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance at a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, to address his victims' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he was staying behind lock and key.
Everyone took part with the aim that everything would lead to a closure.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian radio station NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a little further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and looked calm and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre hint that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not insane and said that there was no evidence that he had had accomplices.
Some may like that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said a victim's relative.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technical genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing in the recently re-discovered job interview, which was dedusted this week before special film screenings on the important markets, is how much this creative mind understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and self-appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer, eager to make diagrams - a man who believed that many executives were suffering from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Specialist Idiots" about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat with Jobs for more than an hour, in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, ten years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company, NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing in the delivery.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will come to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known for abhorring extensive interviews, Jobs appears here surprisingly eager in explaining its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, longer breaks between question and answer occur four times - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responding to Cringely's questions and prompts him to respond more quickly to topics or side actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview seems somehow incredibly far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies do right or wrong in their opinion and represents their own vision of the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous appreciations of career jobs', but seeing jobs here as the eager dreamer on the move to grandeur is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"During all the years in business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline Apple accounting.
Astounded how costs were recorded - usually started with "standard costs", which were calculated on mere assumption and which were then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope was fooled:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the telephone company and lead long-distance calls for free.
Much has already been written about the device, but job enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while they loop through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and when you got on the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next door," says Jobs giggleing.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called via Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were as good as they could follow Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, they had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job for the summer at Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever manufactured."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on at Apple, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember going through arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredibly credible.
About large companies that slow down:
Long before he resurrected Apple, Jobs anticipated the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're doing a better copier or printer, so what?"
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [they are such people] that ultimately lead the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is necessary by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products, exterminated - craftsmanship.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if Microsoft could have been in the 1990s...
You've got the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to make adjustments, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it boils down to taste, trying to deal with the best stuff human beings have created, and then trying to put these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws, accepted as court case
On the day that the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically divided question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the firm to represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit that raised 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care that was passed last year by Congress, a law that became a catchword among conservative activists everywhere in the US.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour fundamental discussion is expected in March, which is probably the result of which will probably boost the 2012 presidential battle, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and claim that the law is overturned will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies supporting the Federalist Society's annual dinner, an established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another sponsor was Pharmaciigant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had discussed the case.
Among others, Mitch McConnell, Republican leader in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending federalist society events for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges exempt themselves from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge can participate in benefit events law of close and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or according to the program a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms related to the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
"This astounding break with morals and the contrast with the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinnerd at the court during a charity event with lawyers with pending proceedings."
Their appearance and support of a fundraiser for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would easily mix court matters with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general prosecutor under the Obama administration when the first legal disputes came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case for bias, as she was too committed to defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make any institutions to do this.
Boeing pulls record order of 18 trillion dollars ashore
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 dual-use aircraft with an option of 20 additional aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals at a record sum of 18 trillion dollars.
Equally unusual is Boeing's client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that Middle East airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 dual Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced it at the 2011 Dubai Aviation Show, an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered a huge increase in fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stock exchange specialist.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful, as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural protection," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirms Boeing's leading position in the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep Airbus' competitor SAS in check, who is attacking the supremacy with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus has announced that it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers supported Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for the Governor's post in the Western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially on yesterday's day, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the Sunday election.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls... they occupied election booths, built roadblocks... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just beaten Claderon, who had been in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came in third place, a severe defeat for the split and unlucky left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have left the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, victory strengthens the party, no matter how repulsive the elections in Michoacan seem.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us look boldly into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, administrative director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must do "everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look "unfailingly" at the difficulties in Europe and said that financial support from Asia to European leadership and resources will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the Mumbai World Economic Forum.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe’s monetary union has experienced a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is fueling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls for leading emerging markets to join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Savings Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would give European partners in Asia greater negotiating power.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its economy is now suffering from declining exports and the dehydration of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult politically to sell aid to Europe to 1.2 trillion people in India, more than 800 million of whom live from $2 or less a day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railroad.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crises will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The ADB's forecast of an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011 / now threatens "the risk of gradation" due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downtrend and significant capital outflow of their vocabulary.
Urgent Warnings from the Pentagon Against Possible Incisions in Defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta warmed up Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would imperceptibly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war sites in Afghanistan and civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already thinking about cuts of 450 trillion dollars over the coming decade, but is now afraid that further cuts of 600 trillion dollars or more will become necessary if Congress cannot complete its spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that failure by Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called seizure, would result in 23% general cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a careless manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a large proportion of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certain probability in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert readiness."
The cuts eventually hit the combat troops," said Panetta.
"While the wartime contingents in the anti-terrorism struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Personnel recruitment has been cut, leading to delays in recruitment and recruitment supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be reduced, leading to late payments to wartime traders and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details about the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result with which we cannot live, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be permitted."
Whether Panetta's letter and the Senator's new warnings will increase pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly spoken bluntly of the possible cuts, although he has had many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the head of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Minister painted a gloomy picture of what might be ahead - a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an Air Force squadron without adequately trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," said Panetta in his opening address in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to engage with potential opponents."
"She actually makes you angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta gave new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global deployment and response capabilities, leading to unacceptable risks in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, which Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If we stopped the F35's further development and testing, it would save up to $80 trillion in the next 10 years, but supporters say it's an important next step towards rearmament, so that possible dangers can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to expose a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy handling the accusations of sexual harassment on the part of several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury, because reports have allegedly been held back that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself as he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations of campaign financing associated with cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office at the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating in school and college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers gave their students the exam answers to make sure that they were good at their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that every day we lie between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, however, are considered a lie of necessity.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognising lies or "uncovering lies" is one that is important for everyone to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game, such as Scharaden, in which the goal is to call "Have You!", defiling a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been exposed.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stammer, blush, and blush.
However, it cannot be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and expose.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, the questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of defiling, and it is clear that defiling a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to find justice in our complex world, especially when hiring or questioning people or negotiating or managing is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, raising their interest and mastering their own emotions, and they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men are more often "self-directed" lies than women, whose lies are more "oriented" - as a rule they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, by observing this person's normal behavior.
It's called "baselining," the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone normally always tripping his foot, so they don't blame him wrongly when he's tripping his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Think of these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of decloaking.
People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean toward the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the interview", this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Questions often falsely signal that an interview is over just to look for this relaxation after the interview.
Also, take care of the language of your subject.
The slip of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Disappointing people can also use a distance language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than objective, often causing the alarm bells to shrill.
There's no magic to expose lies, but you can learn skills that make it possible to expose them.
Thanks to these skills, anyone less likely to be the victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after exposure to delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, annoying the trade unions and at the same time calming environmentalists, the company building the pipeline is trying to re-plan the project so that it can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the Company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week that a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, which would avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama declared in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline will connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the Texas refineries.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska’s legislators, who oppose the plan, weigh the laws to force a turn away from the Sandhill region and the Ogalala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry states that the Ministry's main auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused because she allegedly forced an infant to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had a blunder that scared her little daughter so much that she threw up in fear.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she would suffer from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was November 10th last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to set off on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was getting the car, Roseanna Monk went with his luggage and Genevieve on his arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped off her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arms," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman furiously.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't drop your daughter near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started to scold - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to pour water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell on the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be restrained by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to vomit, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no reply.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls requesting an opinion.
The lawsuit is for unspecified damages, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he would not charge a fee and plan the family to donate the money they receive to the child cancer relief.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is exposed to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climatic adversity slowed down the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of the change and fuelled great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, as a result of the climatic adversity, growth cannot be mentioned, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators worsened.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions in agriculture, but also narrowed the limits to the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter.This is mainly due to the historic decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which slowed down further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity up to November has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, with 55 053 people in Sinaloa having no employment, equivalent to 4.53% of the labour force. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28% and from July to September to 6.19%, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18 969 more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments, the politics of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing at the moment is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, liquidity losses in the market due to the cuts in funds by the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who illegally accumulate dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined, partly because of the problems of entry and partly because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here looking for work here, which causes unemployment to rise," he says.
undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38 percent of those employed in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work come from low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Office for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was by September 5352 pesos, which is much less than the national average, which is 7375 pesos.
Decrease in FDI
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to $630,597 between January and June, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the $5 143,312 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development) for its part has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debts
In the light of the economic crisis, in July the state government applied to the National Congress for a loan of 3,000,000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities in order to reactivate the economy. The State Congress approved an amount of 200 600,000 pesos, but no positive impact of debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be detected by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario López Valdé's incapacity for government obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), argued that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa was really poor this year, and we need to work hard to regain the ground lost this year, and we need to do twice in 2012. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the government team, which has already been well coordinated, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development more difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slowed economy that is not moving sufficiently to create an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will complete the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining calling
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Entrepreneurs' Association) in Sinaloa, said that it was necessary to encourage the state to become more dynamic productive.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
There's a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas where it can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic's prosecutor's office announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - in this case the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by the Mexican military in the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez road opposite guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the convicted person remains in the detention centre.
Debt for construction work
According to Miguel Ángel López Miranda, the social structures for migrants provided for in the programmes Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 are in danger of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay.
The head of the city's social development agency explained that, although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds it is entitled to, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million pesos, 25 percent of which fell on the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of the construction work is to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, even though they would have had to pay us part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not fulfilled its obligations and that the municipality had to borrow 7 million at the beginning of its reign, which would correspond to the amount the central government would have had to raise.
"This had already happened to us in the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance, , was requested to speed up administrative work and pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
The court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The transition of analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, and by virtue of which the switching from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be brought forward due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree detailing the switchover to terrestrial digital television.
This resolution rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
The project for the lawsuit, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional, since the regulations relating to radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the decree would contravene the hierarchical principles and the law reserve.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. After acceptance of the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and ceased all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the case brought by the Chamber of Deputies without going into the debate on the project, which was also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures that the public administration should take under general rules.
"I do not believe that if this were done, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected", she also recalled that the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, for which it is responsible for state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years all over the world, and it makes better use of the radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the benefits of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest that had not only technical aspects, "because they encompassed economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she emphasized, "needed the action of the entire system, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transition, through the government, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
It could not be concluded that, by issuing the contested decree of law, the government intervened in the powers of Congress, since the laws adopted by the legislature were respected," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballot papers individually in Michoacán is being considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of single counting the ballot papers this year is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this spirit, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9th the Electoral Office adopted a series of rules to harmonise local rules with federal reforms in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, electoral law, or electoral justice law to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the time limits set for this, arguing that he had no objection to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional action filed by the local legislature and assessed the State Commissioner's vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", as he did not have the right to "decide or veto".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal, in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes, explained that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there is now the possibility that the local electoral authority can count the ballot papers in part or in full.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted.The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes of the counting and calculation of votes are not available on file or are not in the possession of the chairman of the election committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the fully completed ballot papers can be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the winner in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the candidates mentioned above.
The vote count may also be made in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that an explicit application is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the election packages which have been suspended from a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is almost 0.16%, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
Its ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés poured down on Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday, the funeral show and mass took place.
According to family members, the lieutenant colonel's last will was to spread his ashes over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, along with the others killed in the accident, on a Mexican Air Force plane. The next person to the colonel took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon at noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel landed on the mourning hall, which is located on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. This funeral show was initiated by his former schoolmates from the technical high school and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio belonged to during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would make him dizzy even on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to greet him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: to fly a plane.
A Last Farewell
The Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was honored with his honor under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. He was honoured by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, headmasters and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and was outstanding in both studies and sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter he flew, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority also sat, crashed.
At 6:05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the forecourt of the barracks. There, his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned corpses were found on a plot of land on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military personnel introduced eleven people to the media who had been arrested in the same village in connection with organised crime.
Three men were found murdered by gunshots in different parts of the body and a shot of mercy in an abandoned finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at the kilometre point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood up across the border.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people inside about three meters away, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow t-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; next to him was another who was dressed with a white top.
Less than a metre away was the body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue trousers.
All three of them were on their stomachs.
According to the information received on the spot, the three persons must have been murdered in another place because no bullet shells were found.
The wall of the country house contains inscriptions written by one organized gang of criminals to another, and several bullets were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) presented 11 people, including a minor who was part of a criminal gang that was mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (hunting people) and secret funerals.
According to the public information, eight people were first arrested on 11 November in the settlement of Los Alveros and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured, and the arrested confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
At 6 a.m. on November 12th, military personnel found a car with no license plates and two occupants on their watch lap in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the community of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret burials in General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A message from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed of a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government to the President.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well-stuck," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package called for by the Europolitics in order to regain the troubled confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti to press ahead has been exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, which has caused the Italian government bonds to be charged 7 percent interest for 10 years, which is the same as the situation where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, informed the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government to the fullest."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are designed to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a government consisting mainly of technocrats, which is currently forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure to say that Monti's failure is a disaster.
Monti started on Monday with its debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations as well as youth and women's organisations.
The meeting is expected to be completed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who set in motion an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief reverberation towards the end of last week, when it was known that Berlusconi would resign, the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister has once again reached critical limits for the cost of the Italian government bonds.
Saving Italy with a national debt of EUR 1.8 trillion would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said that his government would have to last until the next elections, which are expected to take place in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in the context of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more playing opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the hump.
From Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 invited players has 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendly match that is taking place today at 3:05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one in FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of selection games of class A, the three-tone team has only defence player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home matches (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, there are the experiences with the Spanish Furie at complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters within the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: the goaltender Iker Casillas, who reached a tie with the former goaltender Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (down 0-1 in London) with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain will record a new record of 127 international matches.
Xavier Hernández, player of Barcelona Football Club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition last week from UEFA, along with others from the Iberian team, who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle stormer of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol is also approaching the number one hundred with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side forward Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the forward Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five games were played: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the fewest games.
Less than 30 games are played in Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national team side, there are less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't even approaching the 20's line.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Víctor Bolívar has only one in Costa Rica and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bass player and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time we've played in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It is such a beautiful country that we will stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted. They experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've played in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on some huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and we love the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we also set no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven't played in a while, we can keep our concentration up better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's also for the audience.
With this tour you are celebrating your twenty-year history.
When you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined playing in a great rock band for more than 20 years, which seems like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are thrilled to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be any better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then, a band comes out of a city, but it's quite unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and are honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is a lot more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I think that we are all lucky to be alive, and besides, we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up, giving each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't get any better.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall into this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came for the music, that reminds you that you have to watch out for the music and what it has created without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. We never cared about that anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built up the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the best. Therefore, we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This will be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of.
Who were you influenced by as a bass player?
From so many+
The first to come to my mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fad?
I don't think we all feel very attached to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it’s great, because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now it is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little lighthearted, but there are other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to both of them when I heard Ed playing them. They are very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something sad happens in your life - for example when you lose a family member or a friend - that influences your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody this for me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his GP informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who has been detained for 25 years for violation of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which operates and is under control four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, congressman and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas for three days to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish for this because he considered him innocent.
He has been operated four times on tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía detention centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian army's death squad, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the Uruguayan collective living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the presidentship of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón's support for the incident with France when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still act as tax havens. This declaration was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrialised countries. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of tax information exchange agreements in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards for tax cooperation.
At business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing trade in goods between the two countries.
The purr-bearded installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser for 25 years, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes this month to the store counters all over the world, has been tailored from the beginning to the characteristics of the portable console Nintende 3DS, with which can be played three-dimensionally without a special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, responsible for the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game to be developed for this console from the very beginning" , because until now successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo underlined that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "affordable" video game that allows for a fast, fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "light" to capture the less tasty users.
After that, the experts can spin a "second round" over the different levels of games that are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, in order to overcome the obstacles without becoming victims of the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This trip Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo winks at the fans of the Saga and repeats the recipe for success of recent editions: The purr-bearded installer has to overcome dangerously-picked platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would allow former Governor Alfonso Portillo to be extradited so that he would be responsible in the United States for the US $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
Thus the trial of the US application for extradition of Portillo ends, so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of judicial authority and government, taking into account that a ruling court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered with court decisions during his government and had accepted all extradition requests that he was informed of.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is an act of government which takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited when his legal situation is clarified in Guatemale and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for embezzling 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This trial was preceded by extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened with social exclusion
The organisation was set up to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social assistance organisation Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6000 young people threatened with social exclusion were supported in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems at risk of marginality.
At yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu, many responsible bodies and institutions took part in the association's work over the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions during election campaigns proved the impartiality of Trinijove's work.
Besides the president of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Lluís Cleries, and Jaume Lanaspa, Director General of the Social Works of La Caixa Savings Bank.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was born in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work that has been done so far is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in trouble.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he explained.
Occupied house, where huge parties were held, was cleared
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
Everything points to the fact that the nightmares of the neighbors of house No. 51 on the street Balmes have found an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they had illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals, which had driven the neighborhood to despair. The evacuation took place by judicial order without police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," confirmed the house administrator.
The squatters, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took with them the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. Moreover, they had painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the beginning of the occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had been reported by the neighbors for disturbance of peace, while according to her statement the noise did not originate from the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters and in particular from the guests of the festivals, which were organized there, and which according to the statements of the angry neighbors in recent weeks became more and longer.
The discotheque's manager explained that the harassment had been so severe that she agreed with the owner of the building that she did not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from her neighbours in recent weeks.
Last week, the chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, demanded that the building be removed immediately and that the problems of civil coexistence and the decline of the district be dealt with.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that the squatters had penetrated all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments in recent months. In some of them there had even been theft.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the anti-social acts in the building."
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people entering the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over fees, the architects agree to the tender.
The urban call for proposals on the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona anew.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its defamation on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became, in the eyes of many, the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that spreads not in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
The role model was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of the yogi bear.
This was the time when the city issued a huge invitation to tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
There is no doubt that a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's planning to set goals on the land.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The call for tenders is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in view of a reflection on the city the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring topic, which two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can fall back on.
And that is exactly the fact that offers the material for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán it is "necessary" to talk about the "front of the mountains" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who about the green apples, has not been carried out.
"One should assume the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it must not be imagined as "access to a park, but as a limitation of areas where action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in urban planning, regards the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space today entails" following the experience of the 1980s, who had their "swan song" in the forum.
The first fear is one's own limitation to what can be built up.
"To narrow down something always means to define the next step", i.e. to cross it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the present [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who adheres more closely to the question, says that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "blow on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the City Council that it has given its body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the letter of conduct, which allows architects to take part in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams that have been set up ("just the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, as a global view of Collserola is missing in the terms of the tender: "There were 16 competitions in the cross-section," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that the area as a whole looks at."
This has led to his participation in the 16 competitions, at least in his case.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between city and green areas.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red's agent freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial being conducted against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the representative of Casino Red has given him to the Second Criminal Court of the District, which is leading the trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, who allegedly forced him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration would approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the lawsuit, the prosecution opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2nd.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after Ministerio Público's official had rejected the crimes of bribery and organised crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre because he allegedly bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he stayed only a few hours in the media security wing as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25th, Jorge Yánez, secretary of the District Second Criminal Court, issued a detention order stating that, after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to accuse Jonás of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house to open it in return.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, requested the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to release the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the court-affiliated Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether the latter had corrected the damage and which of the owners of the betting house had declared his forgiveness. However, the lawyer held the name back.
In accordance with Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak, and in the following, no objections can be lodged against the trial and no compensation is required.
After hearing the authorised representative of the Wetthaus at 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the aircraft accident in which the Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven others were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident, in which the Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and another seven persons were killed, indicate that the helicopter with its whole intact structure has hit the ground directly without the pilot could have initiated an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing was in contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, with the helicopter losing its fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found in the field where the machine had run down.
"During the search no aircraft parts were found at other places, the impact concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, General Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretary of Aircraft and Assistance in Mexico), assured that the helicopter had flown from the Estado Mayor Presidencial at cruising speed and that the aircraft had fallen to a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, the head of SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight. This means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at take-off. During the continuing flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some low-hanging clouds arose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that due to the clouds, the team had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter match. There may have been no loss of control over the plane or any deviation from the flight route prior to the impact.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date suggests that the helicopter had impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter had hit the ground with its intact structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane do not indicate fire or explosion at the scene of the accident.
The latest results indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter was probably broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area beyond the restricted area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had hit the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for finding the gene for obesity
She leads a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" with which the genetic markers are to be found in connection with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and continued on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) since 8 October.
Once the target of 500 to 600 investigators has been reached, the study will be continued on the sports field of Independencia (south of the capital district) and completed on the one of Morelos (north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global diabetes day, he said that three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of six and 14 should fill out nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family history in order to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He also stated that on those Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure were monitored and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors were determined (trying to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health staff about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years the proportion of obese boys has increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Obesity has also increased dramatically," emphasized the specialist of the IMSS.
He claimed that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that a (e) Mexican is 65 percent of an average Indian-American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity is expressed in the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) that we have taken, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants was a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and inner arm (Akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be kept confidential and provided to parents in writing by the doctors. Doctors would explain all measurement results to parents and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, i.e. lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high intake of fat and protein as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs from the pavement were to be taken into account, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 potholes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (Mexico Valley City Area), Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, warned and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt surface would be adequately damaged, the number of potholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Tapholes from a Technical Perspective", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of road surfaces and thus avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon compound of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltenes - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the road surface its characteristic toughelastic behavior.
Toughly elastic behaviour of the asphalt means that at high temperatures of almost 180°C it behaves like a liquid, at 120°C it is very viscous and at 50°C almost firm, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of flexible pavements, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which contained asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this layer of wear has been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move towards it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"On top of the wear layer," he said, "a final layer is laid out, the so-called supporting layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which has also been bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they have to produce friction.
That of this road surface receives and distributes most forces, the supporting layer also requires an adequate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain gets wet, water penetrates into the layer and is difficult to escape again. This causes all layers of the road surface to soften and consequently the occurrence of potholes.
When a pothole is formed," he said, "the cover layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but is a process that needs to be repaired by appropriate maintenance programs for the first signs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which potholes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was the candidate del Valle missing to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th mistitle.
Once again Valle del Cauca went empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with being on the winning podium, presenting a silver crown and the band she identifies as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes with 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had held the crown almost in their hands. Among the proclaimed misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many people are asking today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favourite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing that she had been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also been given to the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury's decision to appoint her First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you most and why?", which had been put to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, in the end I believe that the book that was most influential for my childhood is 'The Little Prince', a rather deep-going book.
I am currently reading 'guilt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book called 'passion'.
An answer that met with little reciprocation, firstly because of the concept of 'civilizing' and secondly because it had not explained in concrete terms how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after completing the ceremony, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for everyone: Please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle has burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favourite who had taken all the side effects and had received all the prizes in advance (Easter gastronomy contest, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, who could not shine on stage."
And that was noticeable at her first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two elevators at the coronation party.
Although she performed safely on both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition, after all, does not become Queen".
In addition, Valle got out of the way of the press at the end - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jurie about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty explained that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. One has to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before taking part in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the Derriere and the fibrosis she was noticed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The trainer of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the belly, which was frankly hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the woman from Valle del Cauca's case was the surgical procedure she underwent.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this award, which was awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was made after the appearance in the bathing suit, which was supposed to come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina will begin her reign as of today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition at one of the international competitions.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who had escaped the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena.
Thus was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopeist from Cali entered history when the man who identified Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4th, a Lophoscopeist from the Cali Procuratorate Investigation Unit (CTI) came in as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopeists in the CTI department, Eliazar González was on standby this week, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working on criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities in Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to frictions, i.e. the palms of hands and feet.
During the week of the attack against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was supposed to identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he was to take with him the ten-finger print of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached with the examiner the place where the body was located, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not in the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant ladle and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was Alfonso Cano.
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
Searching for Traces
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the tribute given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopeists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the persons arrested.
When they are arrested, many offenders submit false identification papers or have none.
We'll take the fingerprints from them and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house during a theft, because the thief had supported himself with his hand right here when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also be used to relieve or burden murder suspects.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspected, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle was consistent.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, he is nevertheless associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscopician of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant ladle or tape is used to take them away.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil service.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID documents," explained the CTI expert.
He said that not everything was as depicted in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not all you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "indignants" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
Most of them followed the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York this Tuesday when they tried to enter Manhattan once again with a court order after being cleared from the square at dawn and trying to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, which they wanted to access with a judicial order allowing the "indignants" to re-camp at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement adhered to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests occurred.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray explained that the response of the "indignants" to the clearing of their camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to justice, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order that forbade the forced clearance of the square and allowed the protesters to camp.
In addition, the "indignants" occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, and is property of Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give exact figures. He assured the Efe news agency that he had also seen several journalists handcuffed.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have arrived at this place, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) will remain closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which will analyse the legality of the eviction that took place at dawn.
Some of the demonstrators driven from the square carried photocopies of this judicial order and distributed them. They even gave them to some policemen who guarded the square, resulting in "some small clashes," as Bray reported, who claimed that some police had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this judicial order the reopening of the square for the public traffic and the demonstrators had been lifted. He pointed out to the demonstrators that the city laws did not allow them to set up again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square at dawn, where almost 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "opposed the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to clear the place because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents "feared for their quality of life".
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers," added the movement spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting press freedom."
The leaders of Occupy Wall Street informed that they were thinking about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been taking since September 17th.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas Show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas show.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities will perform on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV broadcasts images of the television program in which Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of a self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap, which Jesus is supposed to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a moderator on the show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appears as a child of Jesus.
CTV's Christmas program not only relies on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, Bublé had described North American Kim Kardashian as "whore" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After the Earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from early March onwards.
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still recovering from the destructive earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe that Japan had experienced during World War II.
The government’s initial estimates in Tokyo assessed the damage to property at $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were finally used to complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the annual rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the business year starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can partly be explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the fall of 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan has been awoken, particularly thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "currencies of refuge" of investors fleeing from the eurozone debt crisis and the murky forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that weighs like a gravestone on the accounts of export companies.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"It is important to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the Yen," said Mothisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy yesterday.
The prospects are really not very uplifting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown clearer signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, showed that the biggest economic potentials would have been braked.
Because it sank by four tenths to loose 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average of 100 after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens gives rise to doubt again
Papadimos says the austerity measures are being adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the increased risk premia of peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to get lost in the maze that is emerging from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is a reaction to the pressure from Brussels rather than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly being proved by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one hundred days he had appointed might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new austerity measures and would by no means withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date, 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the 26 October summit," said Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's announcement does not remove the doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but to nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge to the EU and IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he would not endorse any commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu's referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand was not to be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "did not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, stated that the inspectors of the Troika would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section" in the amount of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek ball still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "predominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has become the world's second donor for this means of international cooperation. His "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity on the basis of trust in people".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the Fifth World Summit on microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular, the target of the number of people who have to live on income of less than one dollar a day, i.e. below the "poverty limit".
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the beneficiary network "to the very last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will start from the summit, which will last until Thursday, "are guaranteed the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The microcredit summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for launching "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen said that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the concept of microcredit goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia considers to be an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financing instrument as an "admirable idealist committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the local lending strategy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have seen a continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her yesterday to the evaluation as "Head of the Family" in Valladolid and as "Promoter of the Poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her lecture by encouraging those present to take part in the debate and to seek solutions to the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic booms because it was a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy for eradicating poverty" and that the governments of the industrialised countries now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success", "marginized" people who "always stand in front of closed doors" to "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was without real difficulties for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was originally not foreseen in the programme, but was established in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those activists who regard government policy on the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The European Commission's proposal for a presidency proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Among the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted for several minutes and was initially applied by Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schäuble as a result of their intervention decrees, left no doubt on the part of the three European Finance Ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea, as well as the request, has the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which reinforces the control of the European Union, as regards the budget policies of the countries in the euro area, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voting" to give Europe a face".
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which was clearly supported by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been set.
Similarly, the delegates, by an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal of weighting each country on the ECB Board of Directors according to the weighting of individual economies, which would obviously lead to a strengthening of Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who is concerned about calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the points of reference for Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request devotes a paragraph to the significance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in sick reports?
After the family benefits, UMP and the government are now starting the medical reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, in order to visit a family allowance fund and present a speech on the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to put the economy to a hard test, but which on the other hand is no less harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers' health reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government plans to introduce a fourth day's leave before taking into account a health report for employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the permission of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure, which according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to provoke anger, but would help to contribute 280 million euros.
And that would go hand in hand with another measure of a more symbolic character: to grant civil servants an unremunerated day in the event of illness (to date, unlike the three days in the private sector, there is no waiting period for them).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also rekindling the subject of fraud, this time aimed at the abuse associated with absence of work.
"Controls will be much more important, and they will also have to be remunerated if this is required," said Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November, in front of the RTL microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent activities in the area of sick leave seems to be somewhat unproportional.
This has indeed been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as political offensives that have most frequently borne fruit.
The French are no longer sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first of all stick to the national figures.
According to the state sickness fund CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the economic research and documentation institute of the health care sector, the daily severance payments in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros, representing 5% of health expenditure.
This figure was 46% for maternity leave, accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, the average number of sick days was only 14.5, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An average that covers up certain differences: another one, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40 000 surveyed French workers said they had not taken a single day of sickness.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the health reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
In comparison with its European neighbours, French workers no longer tend to be incapacity for work than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (illness or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness reporting fraud represents a negligible proportion of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, only a weak balance is reached.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatic controls on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public University for the Education and Training of Technicians and Engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 completed short-term health reports, i.e. 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the case of more than 45 days of systematic control of illness reporting cases, less than 1.2 million 11% of cases were "unfit or unjustified", i.e. 132,000.
This makes a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have filed a complaint.
A number that represents only a weak balance with, for example, that of undeclared work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the deframation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
This had been announced on Monday 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to do this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, since the country's participation in the euro area was "at stake", as he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit "by the 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had sent forward that his party would not be prepared for an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a congress of his party New Democracy.
He had agreed with the targets of reducing the budget deficit and debt, as well as fighting waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties to support the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word was sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanying suicide must be legalised, according to a panel of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, reports the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, even beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to die.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is made, in patients considered capable of making such a decision.
As a starting point, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has ranked 10th, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to analgesics, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the Canadians’ majority desire to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in the hospital.
From a country-wide perspective, the rate is highest at 86% of hospital deaths in Quebec.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already declared that it does not intend to make any changes to the penal law on euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
But now, according to the experts, all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide have inspected the same, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would result in abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by uncompetent or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, there are many more cases of such violations, particularly in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalised, as confirmed yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied suicide is practised in Canada, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians advocate euthanasia
Let us bear in mind that, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already cleared up in favour of euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalising euthanasia does not mean communicating the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
With regard to the persons who have already practised an accompanying suicide, 41% of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or discontinuation of drugs in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the withdrawal of the funds for which a valid rejection had been made should not be considered criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect the end-of-life loss of funds without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, even beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the remedies already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the Panel calls for pain relief or life-saving measures to be considered at least, as they did not serve to reduce physical pain, nor did euthanasia, and they refer to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the reporting experts among other things as "extreme", since this sets no limits to euthanasia practice for patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which everyone who is life-tired and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him commit suicide," said Rashamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place individual responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, health law specialist, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as the "Pro-Euthanasia Manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular questions the report on the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday to the authorities of the Foreign Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, however, resists it thanks to Russia's support and shows a "complot" directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before Syria was excluded by the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the acting Arab Prime Minister, who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "depose his power in Syria" in which about forty civilians and members of the government were killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, lamented that Turkish mediation attempts to the Syrian regime, which had been aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year, had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and are unable to satisfy them must leave," he said, alluding to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "enhancement of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have struck an ever-increasing tone in the face of repression in Syria," observes Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Department of State.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the Dar'a region in southern Syria have died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
According to this NGO, two other civilians had died in the besieged city of Homs in "Shooting and heavy bomb attacks around Jobar".
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country "taxes towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted emphatically to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not give in," he added, under the affirmation that "the plots forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from the regime's repression of being encapsulated in his "Paranoia".
An extra-scheduled new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the phase-out of the crisis decided on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, probable withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the Arab League's decision yesterday as "uncorrect" in order to avoid supporting possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already warned Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future head of the Italian government, has called for a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a programme called for "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which consists relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme involving a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had to wait for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti of a list of cancellations, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock market and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government program, he stressed, saying that it would be "certain that markets will show themselves stupid and understanding".
His appointment by the president was welcomed by the markets at the beginning, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The current Prime Minister should set up a staff consisting of mainly technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's proof of confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti has since taken up his role committed himself to working in all urgency in the sense of the objective of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change even taking into account the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance objective in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has in particular requested new tough measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, "Chief of the Italian Chefs" who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic recovery" because a country that has no growth whatsoever cannot respect deficit indicators."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoch change" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as "another Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here would be the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy will now have to pay for 200 billion euros of state bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran’s nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapons detonator, confirmed Monday an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recently published report of the International Agency for Nuclear Safety AIEA and other documents originating from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, AIEA reported its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently had worked for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was said to have left the centre to found a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, AIEA mentioned "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear explosive system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only highly versed in this technique, but also, as a member of the agency reported, had worked his entire career in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin directly through essential work on this technology."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes have either declined slightly or only increased slightly in the same period, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas there was a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" rose to 6,628 cases in a very weak measure, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes grow again," stressed the human rights organization Human Rights First."The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had for a long time stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of the law against human rights," added Paul Legendre, a leader of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, estimating that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" is represented in American federal law as a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther King in order to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or ancestry and now also involves crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, making the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" make it easier to read live the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are tracked and who track your messages.
This makes it possible to find out whether they allow them to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested with a small percentage of users prior to its general Internet distribution on Monday"August", said Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, endowed with something esotheric-looking wording (RT for the referenced repetition of another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
Users in the network debated about this innovation through certain "tweets" over the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and is too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" feature will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the large Social Democratic/Christian Democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and to avoid any possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, even though the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, much higher than the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had not fallen from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros of interest each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria also makes a request at the Brussels summit of the eurozone Member States on 26 October: at the time, the Heads of State or Government would have required the reduction of public deficits to be included by the end of 2012, as well as a return to the public balance of accounts in the Constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government for this purpose is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to have adopted such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017, the state's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The objective is to eliminate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong yen
Noda threatens a new intervention in the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that if the Yen continued to rise, Japanese authority would once again intervene in the currency markets.
"Should we find excessive volatility in the Yen's exchange rate, we will intervene just as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen again rose close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31st.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is about to set a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has regularly risen above it, doped by purchases of investors who see the yen as "accuracy value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese motto harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value extracted by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"After the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Japan is fighting for its reconstruction," says M. Noda, who fears that this inflation of the Yen can already kill the weak upswing in the bud.
With growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - the third world economic power has again gained traction for the first time this year thanks to the surge in exports and the consumption of households "seamed" by the catastrophe.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the inflation of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan."
For its part, Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to defuse the Yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, has, however, informed that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", thereby making it clear that no additional currency easing is to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to clear the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of cover it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Euro-zone:
Fast rates of interest up, stock exchanges are pulling back
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European indicators.
Despite the new heads of government in Greece and Italy taking office and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, also drifted a little more into negative areas this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions in government bond yields in the eurozone in difficulty, global equity markets continue to release some of their recent profits.
"The investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which for its part is suffering from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis would continue, had closed with a 0.7% bias.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trading is on a limited range of variations as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which continues its bailout on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for one and a half months.
Around 10 o'clock the European Valuta was worth 1.3570 dolls, so it gave in by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, which met in Congress on Monday, granted a request that specifically provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The interest rates on loans from Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the Italian bond yield reached 6,85% for 10 years, while that of the Spanish title reached 6,2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel investor fears.
The future head of government of Italy, Mario Monti, called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which was threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papademos, for his part, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro-zone summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is located in the visir of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread of interest rates between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historical high.
Looking forward to growth in the eurozone
Statistically, France recorded economic growth driven by household consumption of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office (INSEE) revised the figures for the second quarter, with a reduction of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first projection of the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an occasion to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, an enormous proportion of the world's population should not have to renounce a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce constant electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to forego nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a substitute source for substitution, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to reunite another unit in their park by re-commissioning the Three Mile Island plant, which had been shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is geared to renewable energy sources, is sometimes presented as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The Berlin election will take the form of an increase in the electricity price, an increase in energy dependence, especially on Russia, as a result of increased use of imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will already be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
Denmark is, on the one hand, a European leader in wind energy, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, it is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy, as a result of which its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
Since the price of energy in the globalised economy is a key element of competitiveness and a guarantee of stability for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the price of energy, which would turn the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power into an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are not willing to pay, as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125,000 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a plethora of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France were to decide to withdraw from nuclear power, most of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion in exports of capital goods and nuclear energy would shrink more and more.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of his producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one has to admit that there is just as little a miracle tool for generating electricity as there is a devil's work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants, such as the construction of Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the security concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, so it has been without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was evoked by reactor construction and indefensible human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the previous two.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a design that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power itself.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party leaders dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had titled itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by the authorities had marked the weekly shows, and the Minister of the Interior had casually (see Libération of 23 May) announced that France "does not need talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right hand side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrated workers, should not be a problem for a country", on the left hand side by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that "France could not absorb all of the world's poverty".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 from both right and left.
Both camps perceived immigrants as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit to immigrants.
Francois Hollande confines himself in his programme to banalities, which point out that development in partnership allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections, but it is economically costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarising the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Limiting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening to substitute the local workers, especially the less qualified ones, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than domestic wage-earners, as they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors that are unencumbered in terms of employment.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local wage earners, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where education is not aligned with labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthesiologists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market between natives and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants would result in a related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas introduced by immigrants and economic growth is beneficial (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, on average around 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person immigrating to Germany at the age of 30 will, on average, contribute a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had let the entire 20th century pass over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy prevail over its enemies once and for all.
One knows since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a characteristic of the mental attitude.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can become just as well an "oppression instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, education, an economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is just as severe and first and foremost a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek True-False referendum would have had a double enlightening character in this regard: the need for a powerful return of politics, but also the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to press for the success of the national referendum, which was organised in the wrong order and in accordance with the needs.
A free pass for the European sovereign or a blindfolded leap into the void of nationalistic withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, from the very right, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - and, by the way, we no longer know where to end the list - since there is only one crisis, and it prevails in Europe.
It is all Europe that is bowing to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffer from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - and it is all Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every one of the nations that are attached to it.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to the people's sovereignty.
For it is all about whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and create a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level as a condition, which cannot be made without total democratic legality, without surely leading us to ruin.
After a long time of struggle with this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone today is pushing European economic governance to do so.
Agreed.
But it would be a new folly and a further dead end without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it is proposing to the citizens.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
In order to create the republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not suffice here.
This teaching remains valid.
We must form a more integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become general goods
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris with an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was supposed to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is contactless technology, which allows payments on public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, this year 460 million contactless chip cards were to be sold worldwide!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after a long period of lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
However, the consumer markets are making steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move towards higher speeds, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out bank cards equipped with contactless chips to their customers in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
To date, a tiny percentage of devices have been equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"You're in arrears."
"But they should at least experience a real upward trend next year."
"In 2012, we expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also said yesterday that it was preparing the launch of an offer that would allow its customers contactless payment by mobile phone.
Terrorist Front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm themselves.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and the relations between the secret services indicate clear cooperation," he said, without going into any further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January had revealed interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped by followers of the Aqmi in a restaurant in Niamey, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their abductors during an operation carried out by the French Special Forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the scene of the operation.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the telephone calls led to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that we need to wait for more clear evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's possible, though."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is becoming increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo mitigates.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly evident in their course, as have Boko Harem's speeches and modes of operation, which now point to the involvement of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives bearing the same signature as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community to begin with Washington has been putting pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed for a long time regarded the group as a community of Illuminati, to which no special attention needs to be paid.
Fast success
Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri near a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict observance of the Sharia, while the activists attached to it fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially target churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active in their intensified attacks against the Commissioners.
However, Abuja's reaction is as usual indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, counting 800 dead.
The imprisoned Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical and leaving its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an attack in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was blamed for a suicide attack that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became the primary international target.
Since then, the formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has disturbed all security experts.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned Boko Harem and showed himself ready to "communicate all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-paced America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple, ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters could almost get that impression.
For several days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their comrades have repeatedly announced their thundering statements as well as their statements regarding foreign policy, a traditional republican focus.
Slogans about China, Iran and Israel aid - often not underpinned in any way - fall.
The Mitt Romney, the highest on the agenda in terms of the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to accuse them of "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that has been provoked by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
Dumbly run, if this is to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama, and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost cut off the air with regard to his emotionally flattering behavior.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman is not answered, as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military blows against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he sounded.
"When Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty of obligations to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest-placed candidate, in turn shows a shameful lack of knowledge of files.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be countered, as Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and in doing so seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, says he is prepared to take the American army into service in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama’s 2009 ban on resorting to torture against suspected terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an extra-political heavyweight.
In contrast to the current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and despite all this won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, as far as anti-terrorism was concerned.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so casual.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of National Security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding itself against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama is more likely to surprise by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to resurrect its leadership.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with splendor and Gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under orchestral sound system and gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte symbolically turned the valve's steering wheel, which transports the Russian gas to the western European network.
The new gas pipeline is expected to deliver 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length connecting the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of building a third line sound on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any path through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is now more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not afraid to compare the Nord-Stream pipeline with a "new German-as well asite pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, at the expense of a reduction in European energy, as the project has struck a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas deposits are running out.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way", confirmed François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the large gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete coating, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at a depth of about 200 m.
During their construction, minefields dating from World War II had to be avoided.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," Jens Müller, Spokesman of Nord Stream, stated.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither through valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have refrained from doing so, as the Swedes were not keen to see a Russian state company permanently settling at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than one minute," Jens Müller specified.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the designers as the weld seams were estimated to be resistant to one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes from a seagoing vessel and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, having a diameter of one meter, is inserted into the inside of the pipe and moved by the gas pressure.
After three complete days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on its arrival about any deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without even having to undergo the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have combined their forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated (15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (both 9%).
These five companies have formed a group of companies called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented out the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real volume of gas transported will be," Jens Müller specified.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are prepared to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea on a sandy coastal stretch of pine forest near Lubmin.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the letter a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, with candlelight spent hours writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell-colored sides, as over time aged.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to launch a discounted design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's specialist consultant at the time, is commissioned with the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by a traditional production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton bag that is used, for example, for upholstery of upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was very popular among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was considered an icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now a brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established itself with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom picture of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of city centers and is committed to enforcing its identity.
"We have followed the zeitgeist and his new writing needs, which exist despite the upswing of e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine company: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a cover with leopard patterns on the market at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from its success and cultural zeitgeist and understood to diversify its products: bags, schedules, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the full range of articles.
A success that brings envy to the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a target-oriented public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% unemployment for the total population.
Disheartening?
"No, according to Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, who organizes the "work week for the disabled".
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still a lot to do."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
It is more common for older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no Abitur and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% for the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter the labour market and that make up the core of the problem, says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the attitudes that are certainly but slowly developing.
A study carried out in April by the Association IMS-Entreprendre for the journal La Cité stated that the managers surveyed had "a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled people", which was "overrepresented" "by persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, which date from 2008, refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, General Director of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that are not complying with this law.
The proof: The number of "paying" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the paid-up amounts between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, put a lot of pressure on companies," Pierre Blanc said.
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of workplaces between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while enterprises with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a lucky thing"
Even before they stood up to the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 o'clock), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide their pleasure that brought them the friendly game.
It would be too far-reaching to claim that there had been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the audience podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have liked to make peace.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," says Liller, a native of Liller.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in club and national team, "It's a unity that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought on Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "shin"."
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of seven, and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just ran into each other."
"To play against them is great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, sounded "stolz" with good-naturedness.
"The pride of a gala match."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbours" - that France"has again become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the aircraft with the Blues (the French national team) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he emphasized.
"We're about to plan one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The game against France involved.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked the objectivity of the game.
"At the end of this 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means, in fact, only 90 minutes of bliss.
But there is a match to play and to dump an opponent, Bosnia.
Considering the playout (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put on the matter the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, because we did not score an away goal."
At home, however, in their brightly radiating Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will beat themselves through in front of an audience, which is likely to be the same at the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very close", said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but are completely convinced that we can win the upper hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be part of the 2012 European Championship", however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relatived.
The draw in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A draw can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, as we have not scored an away goal," Bento regrets.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese would want to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning in order to "allow them no time to think."
A good idea, on condition that it is put into practice this time.
