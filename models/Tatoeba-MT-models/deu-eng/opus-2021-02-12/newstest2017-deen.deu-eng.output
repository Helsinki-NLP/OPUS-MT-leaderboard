28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother testified that he can't imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "At last he went uphill again."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, reported to the San Francisco Medical Department.
The San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said that they were "shocked and devastated" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things for him finally went uphill."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook something for us, to prepare dinner for us," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
"For everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that glowed brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's telephone number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always put in drawers or I get labels glued on from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and the reality."
"I myself do not want to always be perfect and successful."
"Honestly said, these things are more familiar to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with loose dutt and Mexican food, according to the magazine.
The question of the desire to have a child is brought to light: "We women do not have to be married or have children in order to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is no child's play", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film starts on August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer and some colleagues sought a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their closing hours, they chased home in a fast gallop to the feed troughs.
One kilometer at this speed, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And with that the riding career ended again.
On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again near horses.
He and his family took a guided tour of the ALRV, but he didn't even swung on a horse for photo purposes.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports assistant presented the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen during a small gala.
The likeable athlete does not lack awards.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver laurel leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
Langer has been supporting young people for decades.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the double US master's winner was inducted into the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
Among the award winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob rider Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the show jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society migrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidencies are divided on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims Trump.
He would massively reduce regulation, and he is pushing for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to perform, it has opportunities to open up to the disadvantaged and needs money for it.
That's why the taxes for the rich are raised, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say that investment is almost identical.
The democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are, for example, strictly rejected by the Republicans' state-critical Teaparty wing.
Trump could thus still be the subject of internal party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart coal production in the US.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to cancel the Paris Agreement on climate protection.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program and demands: "One country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only with regard to infrastructure - also with regard to international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, they do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better.
They are then to be paid better, for example Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a wage of hunger.
She wants to raise him to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go up, then he says that it must not be changed.
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics argue that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least that the rich pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every escaped woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that's only one year old.
One of them put her little son in his arm.
He looks curiously into the room with his big eyes.
His mother stares at the table top.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the managing director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard outside the door.
"It's no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence while fleeing," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars, because they are persecuted politically, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as bearers of hope," she says.
For women, other reasons prevail for fleeing: "Many steal from it secretly, because they see no other way out".
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honor killings, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what drives them away.
On the run, this goes on.
"The fact that tugs, for example, demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not uncommon," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is crazy, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often considered inferior and at worst abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly did not arise voluntarily."
Many women are so used to not saying anything.
"Or they dare not speak openly about what they have experienced, because shame is too great."
Since they often don't know how to help each other, they need more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answered no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swabia, refugees alone are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, in some community accommodation there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important that men and women be housed separately."
"If privacy is lost or men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can occur - continuously."
Especially the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, says the study.
How much women feel about this need for protection can be seen from the crowd that exists on the house in Munich.
"Since talking about us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: demands for new industrial action
Alternates of the interns have called on their union to approve new industrial action measures in their disputes concerning a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire council to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns about the treaty.
In July, interns and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members, which was posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "insistently calm" to problems, leading to the rejection of the treaty.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action, which begins in early September.
The disputes led to a six-time strike this year by interns, the first total failures in NHS history.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 interns and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the medical contract would be forcibly introduced in England.
Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed slim-lipped and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "loving friend" Putin - according to a report five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis level, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But a long-lasting coolness emanating from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin reported and accused Ankara of falling in the back of Russia.
The crime was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to win some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs, first and foremost, all the friends he can get after he was almost dismissed last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists that way, tomatoes that way."
But the visit had added political value to Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, as it regards its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.
In addition, there is the ongoing resentment about the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime changes.
The summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described to me, an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel rejected by the West and badly treated and now join forces.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that, after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the press conference that they had not even touched the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better for the two heads of state to at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the Bank's CEO, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since then, when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will become more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we concentrate internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that we would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th profit at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predication, which is coached by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner, Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori picks up the cheer when he takes the victory on predication
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, won 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernism and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma has been inspiring fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that he had already won 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie's been riding in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned from his six-month lockdown, he had difficulty at first, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from finished - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until at least 50 years of age.
Russia’s Putin Fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In a statement by the Kremlin, Putin stated that without stating any reasons, he had ordered "the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website (in Russian) it is said that he was later chief of protocol and head of staff of the government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works as he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff would resign at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced of this - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy - was met with great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - one might almost say - for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as Putin’s third term would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical battle last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character is written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to the comments of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been part of the series since the first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart's blood in it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there by the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a show.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28th.
Puzzles about fish landing in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandeels spied out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclines.
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, nearly 79% of the entire deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now being cast in concrete for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection to the north tower deck under construction, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massif, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a gradient of about 3%.
Cheerful, as the tolerances the team was working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "luck to be alive"
Three men have "happiness to be alive" after being thrown off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat was moving by its own strength.
"We saw the boat revolve around her and imagined the worst," said the head of Moelfre's rescue station, Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we left it on water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a buoy without life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and unharmed.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it dissipated when the boat capsized from the person who was driving the boat.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Severely injured - man stabs at his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholized perp cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother down.
But she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her partner.
On the street, they met the man's ex-wife.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who is building Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more accountable in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "living concept" for the next Council meeting.
But fighting is programmed.
First and foremost, it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
So far, there is no regulation.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We are in agreement with the Greens: Anyone who wants to build on urban areas will in future have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the inventory.
However, Bratmann says that the big issue in the town hall is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private spaces?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but possibly 20 percent, of the apartments as social housing on such areas."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is designed to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann says, the situation on the housing market is worsening.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.
But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another approximately 1300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokesman Nicole Palm, it is now time for the city to buy ending bonds.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing dwellings back into price fixing.
This is possible in the Weststadt.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
In the Weststadt, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back there in the price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners, the housing companies do not want that.
For if the number of social housing units in the western city is drastically increased again, the aim of the so-called mixing is to be removed.
There should be no more concentration of social weak people in only a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the debate.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU has to get into the boat."
It has concentrated on more construction sites for single-family homes.
What does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot yet be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and making them more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-craze, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later, this created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest declined slightly before the game was released in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the delusion and jumped off the sofa for the search.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person makes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of launching the game, the number of tracked people who train for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that make people "take 30 minutes to come from the sofa" and "be active every day" came across deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Regular exercise reduces your chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical exercise helps control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also grumpy gamblers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What the hell?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to exercise as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will decrease over time.
Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with getting active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Bales creates gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamically on the jumping horse.
Effortless on the beam.
Stunning on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now finally Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-fight title on Thursday and widened the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Alya Mustafina.
American women Simone Biles turns on the suspended beam during the women's single multi-fighting final in art gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-jump title and the fifth overall, as she consolidates her reputation as the best of her generation, or even ever.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Bile and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold to return to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.
American women Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women's singles multi-match finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted that she never planned the future during her long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical tumble pass - are adapted to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost a multi-fighting competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even if Mustafina led slightly through two turns, the picture was deceptive.
Floating beams and floor gymnastics - in which Biles holds the World Champion title - lurked.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and with a 15,933 on the ground put another one on it.
Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her end - a pure formality - and tears poured on Bile's shiny red, white, and blue eyeliners when the vision she once described in her book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old captain, who is called "Oma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial killer case while listening to music in the car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial killer case while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, can be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or $2,900 owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman for Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was connected with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed in nine attacks, and two others were injured, mainly in Hispanic residential areas within four months.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died there.
One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report about the shooting that aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, which is assumed to be the serial killer's work.
Investigators found cartridge casings and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved with that.
What's not right at all -- of course, they got involved," she said.
Her husband Vincent and she were told that Edmund might never be able to recognize her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that he be institutionalized.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know people were still doing that," Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund could neither sit nor crawl until his third year of life and he still cannot speak.
But he's making progress.
He can walk and cycle with support.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented for "Please sing something to me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the cika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare emergency on Friday, and more rains are expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, reports the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is already on its way to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, reported that requests for flood craft, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that the community of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed over large parts of southern Louisiana by Saturday.
The weather service announced that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
A flood warning system was used in southern Alabama on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as it will only slowly flow across the rivers that have been trodden into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.00 on Friday.
Rescue teams were still picking up people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high point of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family had all the disabilities and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers had rescued all three of them in a large military truck and had taken them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "expanded rapidly" as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that since Wednesday the soil has been heavily soaked by the rains.
The authorities stated that severe rainfall and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of the community, Robby Miller, said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed up by the flood.
Emergency shelters were established in the cities of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuees.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa municipality, almost two dozen roads were closed due to the floods and sandbags were provided for the residents to take along, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "pierced by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time this week that a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe this.
The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy's family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether the perpetrators could be among one of the injured men.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there had apparently been a crossfire between several shooters.
Bullet shells for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles overshadowed the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the sidewalk, there were pods.
There seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," said police chief Anthony Ginaldi to the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbeat on her arm when she was playing outside her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm imagining under the women's team in gymnastics for more than one reason.
First, I've been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring for many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team, Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one female gymnast was an Afro-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but this is not how gym classes look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily in private gymnastic clubs maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnasts and families).
The majority of these gymnastic clubs are located in affluent suburbs, which can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive all their training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must enable the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more affordable and more accessible turn training.
I founded my 20-year gymnastic foundation.
At my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics, and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, grab so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Residents want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 interns voting in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract and said that the NHS would be in a "no-man's country" and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first interns are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work, in order to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors, stated last night in a statement: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks met with the government's reluctance to participate and sometimes with deafening silence.
That's what happened to a promise Jeremy Hunt made just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the charge and address the interns' concerns."
If he does not do so, the interns have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the picket chain.
The ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 interns who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS staff, called on the interns to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Arbeitskampfwehrnahme achieve nothing of the little, but already overloaded teams and service providers and only cause the patients, nurses and their families worries, distress and interruption."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the committee of interns and have responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continuing positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career break, training boxes, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was for employers, the UK Health Education and the Ministry of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from one £2 per day medication after the authorities have recommended that more people administer it for a longer period of time.
The anticontinction drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS regulatory authority NICE has recommended a four-year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory authority NICE has recommended a four-year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that form coverings.
When the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
NICE's draft guide, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative effect on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness makes election fraud flourish in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud being knowingly ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and councillors for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now a king of corruption, said that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside of electoral booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should have an ID card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter only has to give his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person's finger when they vote to prevent a person from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a Special Electoral Court ruled that Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "run his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which a person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
In particular, he expressed alarm at the fraudulent postal election - in which older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including holding IDs to prove the identity
His report states: "As evidence, pressure was put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists processing postal ballot papers to stop "election harvests."
The report, considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has cast her vote to prevent someone choosing twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition for political activists to process full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.
To give the police the authority to set up lockdowns for election stations.
An amendment to the law that facilitates an accusation of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksvertretungsgesetz 1983).
No photographing in election stations.
Requirements that only English may be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Intensify training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons, according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "check-ups" of the election registration departments of the councillors.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's judgment in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal.
As the mother of Parliaments, our country has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Crazy about Kate's bicyclist doppelganger and other famous doppelganger of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio got out of hand this week about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be an impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But 24-year-old Olympionikin is far from being the only gold-fighting athlete with his own famous doppelganger this summer - at least not if you can believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood fame.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. team member in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Apart from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison caused an onslaught on Twitter after pictures of him looking like the Wolf of Wall Street Star showed up.
In fact, the archer got the madness of social media and admitted that he had heard since his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see much likeness myself, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be more focused this year: the striking similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to pass as a doppelganger for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years with Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
One step higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athlete version" of the Inception actor
Another lasting comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to resemble an "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put in space: According to this user there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile, which is similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming relay outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC apologized after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and died like "a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming squadron.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS's commentator team to give more "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to close the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada quickly responded online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swim relay for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost the connection, baby."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, with many of them addressing him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We're sorry that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast."
It was an unfortunate phrase, we're sorry it happened."
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to the people who responded to the comments on Twitter
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air last night and to our followers on social media.
To make one thing clear, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unhappyly chosen wording. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming squadron in the CBC Olympics program, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark outraged at woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underpants.
In order to make the situation worse, she surveyed how she looked in it, took her off and put her back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried out four pairs of underpants in a store at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried on her underwear before putting it back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on her underwear, "she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underpants out of the display, took off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky as Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she took off her underpants again, which she obviously didn't like, since she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn't like anything, got dressed again and went out.
"She didn't seem to mind that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underwear she had tried on."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that had another person on and that were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "As I learned, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and moving them out again and they weren't being washed."
A spokesman from Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our Folkstone branch on Tuesday, August 9th."
All eligible products were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself against gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables for your robber.
If you are approached from behind, then you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with your knee in the groin and twist the gun out of his hands as the attacker bends in pain. Hit him in the face with the barrel and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi pretends.
But remember, in a robbery, it's safest to hand over your money unless you're Krav Maga's grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
A British traveller subjected his immune system and gagging reflex to serious testing by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scrapped his train on a Euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button in a train toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The thought of licking the flush button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be totally repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to flushing buttons from toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test
In the film, he said, "Already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he definitely did justice to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample swab showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after their luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.
Mr Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.
In the movie, he says, "That's close to the worst thing I smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did some crazy brainstorming that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added, "Let me say it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular, and 58 percent stated that they at least occasionally use products containing accompanying lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial Family Destroyed before Delogation Social Housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An antisocial family left their social home after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because they terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were forcibly removed from their estate, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden planks were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.
The family have been resettled and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the Cornwall Housing home administration, said that she was afraid that the apartment would be out of repair.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I think people don't have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be regarded as a less beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who had been living in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, quarrelling, and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage has been found
The wooden planks were torn open in the estate where drugs were used in the past.
Neighbors testified that they saw them fighting on the street and that the police had to be called regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly delogged her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
Delogation was hailed by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!
Now that they're gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, stated that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
Garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house
He added, "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her behavior and that of her family, as delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horribly visible to their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will comfort some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation
Home administration workers will now have to clean up garbage mountains surrounding the house
In 2014, the police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, scales, paraphernalia, and cash worth £1,700.
Skeldon was fined after she pleaded guilty to possession of a Class B drug in commercial terms.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now expected to live in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
Police say she's gonna delog tenants who don't follow house rules.
Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police said that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-proclaiming, as well as to those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a low-flying military jet flies over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force made an incredible dive
Air forces indicated it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a deep-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost within reach of the sun worshipers on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The vacationers jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said, "It flew by really deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
Today, the Portuguese air force reported that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so low that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said that the jet flew a little lower than usual due to the poor visibility caused by nearby fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was never endangered at any time.
This summer, land fires destroyed parts of mainland Portugal, which also killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force today indicated that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which restricted his vision
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries against Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in a duel for the Spanish Supercup away against Sevilla FC, and the return match starts three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner has to do without Neymar, among others, who competes in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil, in the match against the defeated cup finalist and reigning European League champion.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament dip in his knee during training, which at least for the time being clarified the one question at Barca in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique thus far gave up a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen took the lead in most of the other competitions.
Before the first mandatory match of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a 0-4 test game by Liverpool.
Lionel Messi and Co. also didn't really convince at the 3:2 test gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Seville, on the other hand, has to digest the 2-3 defeat after an extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic table tennis champion.
27-year-old Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4.4) defeated his fellow countryman and title defender in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
Thus the world rankings first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final game as expected and made up the title among themselves.
Thus it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the single title under the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was former SVS-NÖ legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, and they had no coaches between sets and time-outs.
They had retreated to the stands and let their protégés loose on their own in a fair competition.
"I played the matches so far for my country."
"I play for myself in the finale," Zhang had consistently said.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he set the pace on the record and left Zhang only 13 points in total.
Due to the superiority of Ma, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had contracted a rib injury in his quarter final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to "lastly" content with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic fourth in a similar high age of table tennis.
Donald Trump admits “violent problems” in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing its majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally grandiose and confident multimillionaire expressed some kind of concern, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said to evangelical Christians asking for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida, and Virginia.
Guilt was false reports about his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media scorn.
Republic strongholds wobble
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June survey conducted by SurveyUSA, Trump and his democrat rival Hillary Clinton were equal.
Other institutes see Trump ahead, but not with the distance common to Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance again: "Just as I have done so far."
And pushed afterwards: "This will be either successful, or I will make a very very nice, long holiday".
He does nothing but "tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump Party is said to have threatened to cancel funds to support its election campaign if it cannot present better survey results.
Instead, they wanted to strengthen the support of Republican candidates for Congress.
Olympia: Dreary fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes are facing trouble after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that former sprinter and current coach John Anzrah had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya's team management by the doping inspectors.
The IAAF asked the IOC to provide information on the case in order to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent IOC measures, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, gave up the rehearsal and signed it," explained Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become World Cup fourth in Beijing over 800 meters in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenyan head of athletics delegation Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes in his country of upcoming doping tests for money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping crimes.
In announcing the more than 2000 Doping Target Controls launched by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusual to say that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted in particular.
Before the Summer Games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose doping combat are compliant with the rules of WADA.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
A number of TV reports by the ARD have repeatedly criticised the fact that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and that there is a considerable mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It could be shown that this sport was widely and systematically doped.
Russia's athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
Including a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled himself with the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony with melancholy, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically exceptional!
And then there's Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
"It is very similar to me, to my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It's such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
These are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is that - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - they stop people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that in the event of an election victory, Clinton will remain with Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Judge at the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expected Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokesperson for Reid later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the supreme judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, were lackeys and assistants to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and men"
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differs from Oldschool playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the Calendar does.
"We need to return to the representation of timeless and classic nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person at open casting in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community anticipates mass flight
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, chair of the Gülen-nahen Stiftung Dialog und Welt.
The Kurdish community in Germany expects tens of thousands of protection seekers to flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even become "some hundred thousand", believes the association's chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the tough action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community in Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, of several hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says Association Chairman Ali Toprak of the "World" on Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the thwarted coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that itself receives refugees produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
With this, Erdogan wanted to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the Federal Government "be as sharp as Austria is positioning itself against Erdogan and his supporters".
There is also a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics in Germany.
For the first time in the last few months, I no longer feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as a Gülen pendant destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated foundation Dialogue and Education, the "world".
According to the newspaper, on the basis of figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already represented the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany before the coup due to political persecution.
As of June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all those recognised as eligible for asylum (39.625).
This survey does not include those fleeing war, poverty, or lack of prospects.
Asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the state parliament election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it is not more stupid than before: summer holidays, heat and state elections - that bites itself.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
There are also practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up counting out voices are only toiling to find out.
By 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania once again has to pass election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can even say that, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, which has been the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
Exciting is how strong newcomer AfD cuts off and what ultimately remains suitable for coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one looks away from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Soulring got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD's flourishing.
Her refugee policy, her "we can do this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him now the beautiful office.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it's like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it does not hurt anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
That, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union, too, has noticed that you are breaking the ground in the countryside, that it must make a great effort to find a link with the people again.
She is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the vastness of the country hardly exists.
However, the advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow fighters is self-explaining: "You must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In recent surveys, the Social Democrats were 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just a short time ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the Landtag.
They turn the holiday crisis into a modern virtue and, to a large extent, put their election campaign on the Internet.
"Online election campaign", the country's chairman Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green campaigners are looking for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curving through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and still finds it beautiful.
Your impression: "Electional leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment".
B27-Renovation: Restaurants suffer from blocking
The speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.
For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only around 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They've done everything pretty jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet petrol station.
It's a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south as planned, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
It also commends the concession of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the installation of makeshift entrances.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was also lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is thus again established, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
From Ofterdingen, the citizens can now travel on both sides of the B 27 again.
The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.
"Some of the complaints were considerable," says Florian King, Deputy Head of the Department responsible for the traffic management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many Schleichwege were looking for and familiar with their navigation rather than the signs.
As a result, some trucks got frayed in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been considerable overruns," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There have been flashes of two to three per minute.
The fastest was at 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.
But since the construction site moved on, it has calmed down.
For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to a drop in sales, lets everyone you ask see.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, for whom the reorganization has hardly any consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline" at the Maier dealership, but also admits that of course "the running clientele is missing".
The most crowded are the restaurants along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
It's already life threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants "hit it hard".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
He puts the loss of sales at "over 50 percent".
The road renovation had "thrown back" its operation by two years.
He had to dismiss half of his staff.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half of them were fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, in response to a question from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, the President of the Government, Jörg Schmidt, replied by saying that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the reorganization.
Göhner knows about other counties where something like this has been handled more generously.
In all lawsuits, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, he points to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars are now visiting less frequently because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will come back after the renovation works have been completed.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction works on his customers to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
In the name of the fight against terror, laws are constantly being bolted.
Following the recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now presenting a large security package.
But what does toleration status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior when presenting his new security package.
You're not overburdening anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was interested in results and in "a attainable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière let a little time pass before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, aimed at: that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities also comes as no surprise.
In part, de Maizière is starting a second attempt at proposals that had not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to penalise sympathy for terrorist groups and take away the German passport from jihadists with double citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still considers this reasonable and also does not demand anything that has no chances with the coalition partner anyway.
De Maizière also presents some new ideas.
Some of them have it in them: he is planning quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for incarceration of people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should have their smartphones checked beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
He wants to make some of them even worse in cases of tolerations for rejected asylum seekers than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things still seem unexplained and leave questions unanswered.
And on a number of points - for example, the unequal treatment of the patient - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that deeply occupied the people could not be excluded even in election campaigns.
Internal security has become a major focus.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
There's a lot of uncertainty.
And yes, they're going to campaign.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a position on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, the two parties have had a great deal of trouble.
First a nasty dispute about the equipping of the federal police, then about a security policy collection of some Union Interior Ministers, in which the department heads also demand a ban on burka and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives for conciliatory tones here.
He doesn't think of turning away from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
It's not a good idea to reopen it.
And in a burqa ban, he had constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, has yet to be revealed.
There's a lot in there that could cause a fight.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to make its mark on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signals a cautious willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
Volkswagen is still glimpily getting through.
Despite diesel scandals, deliveries worldwide are increasing.
But not all markets are running smoothly.
There is a vortex around a term in the recall action.
Volkswagen will start its deliveries in the second half of the year in a more restrained manner.
Europe's largest car manufacturer continues to show a plus in the course of the year, despite the diesel affair thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
But in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus again burdened the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax reported.
The VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide in July with 449100 cars than in the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the month of the previous year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost one-sixth.
Brand Sales Manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, there had been a reluctance to buy in some core markets through "changed economic framework conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to withdraw from the EU has also burdened, explained a spokeswoman.
In the USA, where the exhaust gas affair first escalated, there is also still a minus.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
All in all, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is still coming through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a delivery drop of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is due.
From January to July, Fred Kappler, Head of Group Sales, continued to show a sales increase.
During this time, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles, worldwide 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars for retrofitting to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
There is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion of the vehicles.
The car manufacturer issued the customer with a "guaranteed" certificate after the conversion, but did not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in business circles.
The reason is legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Department of Transport confirmed that there was a meeting.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and the KBA."
"Differences are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to the type approval will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, half a year after the conversion, customers will come to a workshop with an engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interests of customers, it is also important to avoid any uncertainty about possible warranty regulations, as it was said, in the event of any other damage that had nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal.
Therefore VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will demand fine interest from rich savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank CEO Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on current or daily money accounts".
The German Banking Association (Bundesverband Deutscher Banken) speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers "should not fear to pay for their austerity penalty rate".
If banks store overnight money at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4% penalty interest.
This fee will be charged to Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards by private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on current or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
For some time now, he has been guarding EUR 40 million, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not use.
"They are in my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the head of the bank.
"I can't lay down 4000 euros for every million."
He now passed on the costs according to the polluter-pays principle.
Leaving the cash simply in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I have already experienced four robberies, I don't want the fifth!" said the bank board.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria stated: "The extreme monetary policy stance of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks".
To carry them alone is "permanently not possible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay for deposits nationwide, and competition between banks and savings banks is far too strong for this."
A banker said there was "a clientele a little more luxuriantly endowed with wealth" on Lake Tegernsee.
"This can be a problem for a small bank" if they keep money free.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria "there are currently no other banks known to charge a replacement for deposits from private customers," said Spokesman Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, President of the Federation of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), declared: "The threshold to go negative towards private customers is very, very high."
The competition is fierce and there is a threat of investors moving to the competition.
The customers in Germany will not let themselves like this in the breadth.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the comment section to cover it with harsh insults under the pseudonym NotAllSolitaryMenMiddle Ages, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-spoken resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are likely to be aged between 45 and 54.
Indeed, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.
It is also not a horde of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and scurrying wildly before I stand still, holding my hands and saying something determining like, "Well, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even if the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I am in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, who I follow from Sister Ray (number of dates: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of dates: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is for one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he couldn't afford when they appeared and again buy items that he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things that I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media horn, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves moved to buy their old records again.
From the conversations that I have had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom in followers of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record business offers a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took a push on the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that evoke happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.
That's how it is with me as a collector, and I think that's how it is with a lot of people.
It is an easy way to be spiritually occupied.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff member flutes from a record stack.
A April ICM survey revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not heard it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I browse through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Somebody just came in here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older people, who are only slowly getting in.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost a whole floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I am going in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teen boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roars from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look very lonely, but gnawing mental traumas are hard to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more of a shop window shopper than a big shopper.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is..." she exudes with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I appear to be looking at the jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure record art.
But given that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research revealed that YouGov's results are correct, they ignore, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning strolling through the record shops of Berwick Street and leafing through records, while avoiding the staring look of an eerie, 30-year-old fake presenter standing over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
More scientifically, the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says that the record was in a female who is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long.
French court rejects offer on demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to dishonour dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should have the power to tear down 72 provisional shops where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which entail a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also explained that the temporary shops and restaurants often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the tearing down was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run for non-profit purposes and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian stated that the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains militant
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, cycling pro Tony Martin does not want to be defeated.
"I keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and keep fighting," wrote the 31-year-old on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place in Sugarloaf.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He had to analyse in peace what had led to the debacle.
Martin wanted to compete for the title at the World Time Trials in Qatar in October.
"I'm going to look at everything we've changed lately."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-timer world champion, who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday to the 54.5 km Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis professional Sieggemund missed semi-finals
The triumph of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter finals of Rio: The world rankings 32nd from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA no.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, which was plagued by back problems, could only make its impact once and seemed powerless compared to the previous laps.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British woman Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German professional tennis player to win a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarterfinals of the summer games had last been in 1992.
Never before was a German duo in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from this.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
Microsoft did not report on Thursday how much money is going for the takeover.
Beam only launched its offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and confront enemies and provide equipment to players.
The game giant Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event Facebook should help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the start-up, which has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington, USA, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
Therefore, nothing should change for the customers as a result of the takeover.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by online retailer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google's mother alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's speedometers have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flashes are being tested, which are supposed to carry out particularly effective speed indicators.
The futuristic enforcement trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident focal points, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.
The enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: Its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be simultaneously recorded over several tracks.
Variable speed limits and transit bans according to time, lanes and vehicle category can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, it is possible to move the trailer with any car with trailer coupling in the raised condition.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armored and by the way also bulletproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 units, following an order of 150 last year.
UK gets silver in 7-er rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in 7-man rugby came to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis in the finals on Thursday evening, when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, rearrangement, line running and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best shape in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Britishman will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way to go.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
This slopp will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs bounce off out of fun.
It felt like running on buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau was in the corner.
With four minutes left, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A high-altitude tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of play time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou presiding through further weak tackles of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29.0 until the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental mid-term changes and closed the Fijian gap...for four minutes, which was good for the first half conditions, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interim play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the grandstand.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame set the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked in the grass.
Earlier that day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a close semi-final match - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the coach's cancer for rowing victory
There will be no more emotine gold than at these games, and that means something.
From the first rowing to the last 220 hard blows that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was all present when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport who set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39th undefeated commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the way of triumph.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if this is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital running around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual and trying to cope with his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nobody, so a massive thank you goes to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to unlock, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped right now.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the trial, stay in the trial."
It's really important not to be carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover must be at a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the "Veitensteingruppe" water association, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is regarded as "Bavarian-wide exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago, the original sound was said in a contribution by Bayerischer Rundfunk.
A short time later, the Water Forum of the government of Lower Franconia appreciated the Association of Purposes.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was regarded as "exemplary in Bavaria".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Zweckverband Mitarbeiter, 28 years of which as managing director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, produces about 150000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach are members.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water warden in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zweckverband as early as 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and ranged from pipeline construction and maintenance to office and organisational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions, to emergency operations on weekends," the chairman said.
It identified as outstanding events the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the rehabilitation of the high tanks (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There had been no stoppage at all and there had been repeated innovations because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years.
He has committed himself with a lot of heartblood to his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association literally, as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was able to present the Veitenstein Group's success concept for nitrate reduction in front of the Wasserforum in the district of Unterfranken.
He had received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water waiter, and he was a loyal squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the construction of wells and the restructuring of the functional association as highlights.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high tank near Kirchlauter on a 3rd January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, it was necessary to work all night long so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high tank from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
The soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and addresses other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the illness was recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
However, the eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, when I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at La Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he's the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Beziehungsstat in Bargteheide - man shoots at life mate
A 35-year-old man shot and killed his partner at a multi-family house in Bargteheide, Stormarn County, on Friday at 10:45 a.m.
"The man himself called us and claimed to have shot his partner," said a police spokesman.
The perpetrator is on the run, he is publicly searched for.
Now nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about six feet tall, muscular, tanned and bald.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man is bald.
I don't want the man to be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, according to the police.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship act".
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide information about the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a homicide."
"That's all we're saying right now," said a police spokesman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special task force (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - A bright spot for German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared additional costs of millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the sector from the promotion of green electricity are off the table.
It remains with the exemption from the renewable energy levy for the existing plants for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I'm really glad that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption to pay for it.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks would an EEG surcharge of 20 percent be incurred.
However, this was not raised in the steel industry either.
IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on its own electricity generation.
This largely establishes the status quo of the previous scheme.
Gabriel's successful efforts were particularly important for the steel industry.
"With regard to our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"Others have to follow."
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed when reforming emissions trading," said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.
Last year, the situation worsened further when China, the world's largest producer, threw massive steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
In the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel have had an effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable price recovery is.
The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, the prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month of the previous year, as reported by the German Steel Association on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than in the previous year.
The association expects an increasing output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, mind, health: Singing is good for seniors
Ursel Kipp has accompanied singing all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in her teacher's studies she took up the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels more balanced, cheerful and alive overall, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors right from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
By being together regularly, senior citizens can make and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir: "To discuss and organize yourself, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs don't get out of their breath so quickly even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Group of Senior Citizens' Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together was much more important; it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs evokes many memories in older people, often with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even demented people remember long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also required to perform a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focusing on one's own voice and a given rhythm while adapting to the other singers is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
Showing myself: If I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join them.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church leader directly.
Many senior citizens can also be found on the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbours for help in searching the Internet.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats are more sensitive than hangovers to the cries of young animals
In Hanover, biologists have investigated the effect of calling kittens to adult animals.
To their surprise the Meowen did not leave the males cold either - however, they behaved in contrast to the females always the same.
Female cats can recognize the arousal of kittens on the meows of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens who are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the meows of less and strongly excited young animals are either not perceptible or not significant for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the lead author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult males and eight female kittens from the MHH were observed.
On the one hand, they were played by little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who did not yet have their own offspring, reacted differentiatedly to the cries," said Konerding.
They turned to the speaker faster when this call of the more excited kittens played.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noise in humans.
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches for Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match takes place in Turkey.
Before the match of the arch rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is on the agenda.
As soon as the state of emergency was imposed after the coup attempt in July, the government declared that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the attempted coup.
Even before football is not stopped.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
According to this, Sükür, who is now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, in fact this has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" in public places throughout the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
Sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
In particular, fans of the Besiktas Workers' Club traditionally do not belong to the president's friends.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
Lukas Podolski will be the winner of the Cup "Gala".
The Kölner proved his sporting value in the past season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as a top-scorer of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1-0 victory.
The "Fanatik" newspaper cheered him: "He was the best in the field."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the trophy.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record champion reached a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary round knockout in the Champions League, the Lions also left early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it was only sixth place.
The season wasn't good.
The trophy was the only way to win something.
"We did this and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
The season went better for Master Besiktas.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 goals in the season as Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
After the coup attempt, Gomez, who was under contract with the Florence AC and was only loaned to Besiktas, had announced that he would not return after his EM holiday because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, all he has to do is say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club Director Fikret Orman.
To do so, however, the striker would have to be willing to give up around a third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman stated: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal chances at the Olympic Games in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been detained twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Juliana Jefimova, who had claimed her right to start after a doping lock shortly before the games, was mercilessly whistled out and booed out at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a bizarre scene: She was still strutting into the hall with a smile on her face and had provoked her appearance.
When it was clear that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a cheering storm.
However, there are many other athletes who, despite doping history, are taking part in the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already blocked twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion have run even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m relay/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to serve a six-month lock in 2010, after she was shown to take the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, World Champion of 2013 and European Champion of 2010-2016 was tested positively for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the knowing ingestion and was blocked for six months.
The four furthest litters this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and was closed for 21 months.
A penis enlargement agent was responsible, Merritt affirmed.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was subsequently stripped of so many medals.
Tichon lost his World Championship title in 2005 nine years later after being diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver 2004 due to steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship due to testosterone abuse.
He was also awarded the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Court of Sport CAS.
At 80.04 m, he is second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km of walking, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was tested positively only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old World Champion found evidence of the use of a banned dietary supplement, the blockage of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and expired on 13 July.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She had planned her trip home in early September.
It is still unclear whether Austrian citizens will be affected by the further explosions on Phuket Island as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
In Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs had exploded in a nightlife area on Thursday evening.
According to the police, one Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two IEDs went up again, and another person was killed, according to the authorities.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured during the detonation near Patong Beach, which is popular with holidaymakers.
In Surat Thani, on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the IED went into the air in a flower bed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast caused several injuries.
One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, they said.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee said to journalists on Friday morning.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to comment on possible motives - but it was probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received intelligence information about imminent attacks in the south of the country, but they had not been informed of the exact time and location.
It is still unclear which group was behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin there is a palace that has been used for years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry on its homepage recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be strictly followed.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary travels to these provinces are discouraged.
Increased security risk (security level 2) would apply to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence in the years to come.
Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, benefits itself from having brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels, which has been smouldering in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "Identitarian Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also placed the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' indications for efforts against the liberal democratic basic order," said head of constitutional protection Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants are defamed by Islamic faith or from the Middle East in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "multicultural delusion", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitaires".
Maaßen said that his authority had closely coordinated the decision with the state offices.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of constitutional protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-friendly language, often with pop music.
This would be done by Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a covert advertisement for one's own cause.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Most recently there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarian" to AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of that.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind were only relevant from a certain point on.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain persons who are extremist and becomes so extremist.
The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This was not apparent.
In view of the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have seen in recent years that there can be legal terrorism structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, there is no evidence of Germany-wide or Europe-wide governance of legal terrorism.
The previous groups had emerged at regional level or on social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern at the fact that many attacks were carried out by people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right-wing extremists before, who were perhaps politically indifferent or who, for example, chose CDU, SPD or left, but who then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist moods."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internet hit
Olympic or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the clip was selected.
In the social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and finished 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
Following a "well-being belly", the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only hit the 100 meters freestyle with a minute and almost five seconds, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the race of Eric Moussambani attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to compete alone in a 100 meter freestyle forecourt.
In Frenetisch Moussambani was fired at at that time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop on the New Square has been robbed.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her shop at around 5.30 p.m. on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she came back the next morning at 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the impending election defeat so narrowly
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
If nothing happens to the election as US President, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He'll just go on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would not care about it: "Finally, it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV channel CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, said Trump.
He described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State Terrorist Militia (IS).
Within his party more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters the trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently great.
The Post is planning to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
The Group plans to start trading with the transporter shortly.
From next year, Post will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
For months now, the company has been examining whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and parcels, to other companies.
Post board member Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always requests, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn-based company wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles in the near future.
The company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift in its own post-production facility.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and in the long term announced a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're relocating the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK leadership withdraws after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann would become even more uncertain the longer the success promised by him.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the world's number five in the industry is about to start a new career.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
As early as September 1, the management board member Gerhard Hausruckinger took over the management board, the company informed the company.
He is to take on the role of "executor" until a successor is found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the resignation, the company cited "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesman did not want to give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
Investors said on Friday that shareholders were most disappointed at the continuing lack of success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring, however, are still not visible after 5 years," it said.
In view of the last bad GfK business figures, every shareholder becomes worried at some point.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had not been able to stop its loss journey in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Sales decreased by 3.4 percent to EUR 721.2 million in the first half of the year.
Profit in the second quarter was impacted mainly by the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The goodwill write-downs of EUR 139 million, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit, brought the Group a net loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK still had a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
In the event of an accident of a coach with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered severe injuries, the police reported.
According to her information, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid an oncoming truck, which partly drove on the opposite track.
The bus left the street to the right and slipped into a ditch, as reported by a spokeswoman of the police Aurich/Wittmund.
"Due to the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire department freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and an ambulance came to the scene of the accident on state road 2.
The uninjured travellers were taken back from a bus to the Krummhörn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
Investigators called on the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of waste water will be 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater plant from 1 October 2016; 3.36 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously 2.26 euros) and 3.64 euros for Azendorf (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After a comprehensive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, it was found during the approval of the household by the State Councillor's Office Kulmbach that for these waste water plants there were undercovers.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities cost-covering due to legal bases.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As management manager Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and under-coveries from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt explained the serious increases in fees by the fact that all three waste water plants are relatively small facilities with a very small amount of waste water, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the small distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants is slightly declining.
Furthermore, in the previous calculation period, all three plants had incurred considerable renovation and repair costs, not least due to their age.
The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water plant in Azendorf due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged out, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "In addition to these extraordinary expenses came the continued care and maintenance costs, which have to be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still significantly below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that the costs for the operation and maintenance of the three plants are "full-blown" in the case of the low waste water build-up.
Schmidt added that the market community has been spared major maintenance costs for wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned plants would remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Wastewater Treatment Association could not be extended to include these plants because they were in deficit.
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% as measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed compared to the previous month for the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
As in the previous month, prices remained unchanged for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on absurdity.
They can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, feature twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps are made public.
Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past, accusing them of promoting Blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested to some users this week a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "Yellow Face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a major problem that the company has diversity.
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced rasisism, the filter reminded of vile clichés.
Others strongly rejected the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about the photos were widely distributed, wrote that the filter was "harmful and, to say the least, unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-eyed, but that the yellow face has been pulled to the derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older opponents - might rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "so it's much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asking others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, male-only leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either she has no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in her workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a human resources officer who focused on under-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said that she would leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that's not OK."
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, finds Congress Committee
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to give a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a Congressional committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Message information typically nodded off by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly gave a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, and were consistently more positive than analyses by other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that Obama’s leaders have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have been subjected to pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Kansas Republican Congressman, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to minimize the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue.
In addition, further investigation of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense is under way.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," said the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morale among analysts and "excessively gave little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of White House intervention with Centcom analysts on "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were published by The Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's Inspector General, which were initiated after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on any Congressional reports while the Inspector General's investigation was still under way.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).
However, last year’s accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism about the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disagreements of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only provided for a small occupying force in Iraq and spent little time worrying about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, according to government officials, Mr. Hooker's team noted that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this realization was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is on the way
One day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match against India on Thursday that American women won 3-0.
Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember having ever done that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of the people who remembers their gates.
But she knows that: The Americans are in the Olympic competition at 4-0 and are in the first place in their group with the British, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two will win first and second place within their group of six teams.
The first place winner will avoid the strong Dutch women who lead the other group a little longer.
Whatever the outcome of the game on Saturday, the American women have caused a surprising stir with their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places in the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time at the age of three (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), and at the age of 16, she became a US national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team, and with that things began to turn for the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We've been able to pull the rudder around completely.
On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand strike from the near area.
India had entered the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She made a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and blew the ball into the goal to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to score one goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
Amidst the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a raging relay run between competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a burning stick, which is passed from crossbow shooter to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is present for the first time at the Olympic Games and a flock of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names that are broadcast at Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline gym.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event in the same way.
Further from the centre, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign for a long time.
But if I'm modest enough to make arguments for my particular favorite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it debuted in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived for the last 16 years that many of the people I asked didn't know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon-like shaking of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means "jumpboard."
Rising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air and have to make a series of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are rated according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medalists must go on, faster, up and over in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They not only chase the finish line or the exit wall, but in the television broadcast also another mocking goal: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I feel as a bit tiring when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a respite.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
Forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up.
Here, too, there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no vaulting into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general.
If the raising of awareness can only be achieved through the affinization and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymnasts recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new fan base, which is struggling for air.
"One generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses testify that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during gunfire.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government's response was merciless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses claimed that police officers shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos circulating about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now asking for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have consistently led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, effectively silenced dissidents.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
All youth protested.
A generation protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the Eritrean border; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of simmering under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethopia, predominantly Christian highlands, flourished in politics and economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But that too is changing.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which make up around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unpublished illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly savvy at seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using Special Representatives to work on opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, were apparently botched by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked businesses run by Tigray, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge walk."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS had been "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group was not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the presidential candidate's communication skills as to whether he was able to communicate with the American public in a clear and understandable way.
It also brings his associates, who try to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After making the hint at an election campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rowed back with regard to the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely seriously.
When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism beats Mr. Trump as he tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling poll scores.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he received strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I meant that sarcastically."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, to "clarify" depending on how the reaction turns out." said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his polls have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misinterpreting his humor.
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is legitimate political commentary," said Mr. Giuliani on the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbenchers, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by refraining from aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for presidentship.
Once supplanted by the price of the market, Café returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prizes were supplanted from his Bedford Avenue store front.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, excluding the Chelsea Hotel, and verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is change, then it's also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café who owns and manages the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide funds for a new branch, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb used the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also supplanted by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, once lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she'd be on her way.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized it was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they put butter on my everything bagel," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't hold any grudge about the soap store taking over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the café’s cold brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we'll go into her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice bar wants to bottle and sell the cold - brewed coffee.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a fondness for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman's book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will be published on Tuesday by Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, unscrupulous snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple found it appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been lying in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country no longer used to be the land of slag.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: Mysterious foods such as breads and casserole rolls became staples, the casserole roll as a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for many years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried out, as high - calorie and nourishing satisfaction took precedence over taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at noon," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions don't match each other.
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.
As never before or since then, domestic economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and meet the challenge of turning pancakes like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-kuchen-Essen attitude, are tasty.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the millionaire man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully out of touch with reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Ms. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most dismal preparations."
Many of the ways from the Great Depression era to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated that they understood Ziegelman's mother-in-law's eating habits better - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the dishes at Eisenberg's had been cleared, she and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plump dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each grudgingly dipped a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a follow-up three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in Bomb Attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old has died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to Bild-Zeitung, has saved nearly 60,000 lives.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector showing him in an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said loudly, "For me, this is the real jihad."
"If I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had talked in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims at a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks do not grow up until they are 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims leisurely along the bottom of the North Atlantic, reaching an average of just 1,220 metres in an hour.
Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km/h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this slow lifestyle seems to be a recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least about a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.
Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist had long suspected that Greenland sharks would become stone-old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know little about the life style of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
These sharks still make prey: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling the bottom of the icy sea and searching for cadavers from higher layers of water torturing down.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen from Greenland or Spitsbergen between 2010 and 2013 as by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest one was 502 centimetres long.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lenticular core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is already formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lenticular core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 ’ s, when nuclear tests threw larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lenticular nucleus contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it probably celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lenticular core, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimetre long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502-centimetres may even be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only have offspring when they are longer than four metres.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks obviously allow themselves with the multiplication at least one and a half centuries time.
This, too, is likely to be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.
It is no coincidence that such methusetals live mainly in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip on its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a sparing flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that they have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Ground in a double pack
In the most recent meeting, the municipal council focused on issues related to building.
The panel welcomed the statement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the real estate, parcelling and development issues could be clarified and the applications for surveying could be submitted, the sale of the real estate in the residential areas "Strasslweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - expansion section 1) to interested parties no longer stands in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal equally to young families and old people.
As it was said, building contractors can now report to the town hall, and the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots in its September meeting.
In order to be able to respond to requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises, together with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-areas, which was not newly established until the spring of this year.
In the area of Unterzeitlarn, the already designated industrial area is expanded by two parcels in the direction of Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city on the Main thus has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial institutions can continue to operate from London through financial transactions throughout the EU.
The so-called EU passport has so far been approved in Great Britain.
That's what large US banks are using right now.
Several banks have already announced that they will move jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which brings together responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority EIOPA and the Risk Board ESRB, speak.
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"Proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but, like Dublin, it is less efficient in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city scores with easily available commercial properties.
"It's not that easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties were also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the management consultancy Mercer, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg ranked 19th, Dublin ranked 33rd and Paris ranked 37th.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," concludes the IW.
However, despite Brexit vote, London will remain Europe's most important financial centre, according to economists.
This is also reflected in the balance of power: According to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector in London at the end of 2015, compared to 62,500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it from the Hepatits C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million compensation payment for the violation of two Merck patents related to the Blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge exposed a pattern of misbehavior by Merck, including perjury and other unethical acts.
When the lawsuit was brought on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to remission of the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work that was based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left it, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently combing the city after the departure of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have liberated over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish informed Manbij Military Council Reuters, who was allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are doing clean-up work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton made nearly USD 5.3 million in speech honors; the former Secretary of State stated an income of USD 3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's candidate for Vice President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though they are not legally obliged to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"You're on the move," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter regarding the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charities, his business practices, and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already fallen on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump is calling for his tax return to be published.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on economics in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday stating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called for Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subject to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump had "fear" of the voters and not of the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014, and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax return of 2015 showed that they only received USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton's dividends and income taxed at USD 109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox species to prevent elephants from going to people-inhabited settlements - throwing condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, together with the U.S. Nature Conservation, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we've developed the toolkit, we've seen a change of attitude within these communities, and they're much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide's CEO Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing it into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "Chili Cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a firecracker into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A touch quite usually already out to chase the elephant away.
A final possibility is a thrower that shoots a gold - rained fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City council unanimously decides: No new kiosk building on the St. Goar Rhine bank
Normally, the St. Goar companies accept investment projects by traders with a kiss hand - since the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the request for a new sale kiosk on the banks of the Rhine near the Rhine balcony under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but this kiosk does not fit at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU faction.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli code was removed after "Arab" prompt - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli primary, as according to one employee, Arab guests would have "requested".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", skipped his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country pre-election list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was an "intentional decision by the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind this caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the code be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
That's really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in this very hotel chain is even a greater shame.
There's no need to explain that.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a rather large response on the Internet, in which people called it a scandal.
Some assumed that the Kempinski Hotel would have yielded to the alleged demands of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," said another article, which pointed out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident a "accident" and "apologies" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct order not to include Israel in the fast-track list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti spraying on walls against provisional President Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after mass protesters took to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been dismissed from office by a Senate vote.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year with the lifting of sanctions.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown a strong interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upturn was achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Mission abroad issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses Wanted: Drink market raided in Waldbröl
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
With a gun in place, three darkly dressed people, who had mucked up their faces, demanded that the employee of the beverage market hand over cash and then fled on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
The police don't tell you how much money was taken.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is difficult to see.
The perpetrators must have run after the attack towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the car park entrance with the silver-coloured car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Those who have made observations at the time of the crime (at 7.45 p.m.) that are related to the robbery should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Play and fun at summer leisure
The children and young people of the social-educational day group/social group work of the children's protection association Nagold spent eight happy days with their caregivers on their summer break in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet holiday home Hardtwäldle the lively group was accommodated during the first week of school holidays.
Several full day trips were on the agenda.
On the one hand we went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and splash.
Culinaryly, children and caregivers were spoiled with their own prepared personal dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewels of pearls and stones were created, or a Roman mill game was made of wood.
Other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, evenings by the fire and the final "Bunte Abend".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministrators from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Rome pilgrimage of all the ministrates in two years, the Oberministratenrunde St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the final decision was made in favour of the bishop city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the gate of mercy at the Freiburg Cathedral.
16 minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set out.
The evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and blessed the pilgrims.
From Horb there was a train ride to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage from the Münster was started.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches took a rest again and again to sing together a song from specially compiled pilgrim songbook.
The parish homes of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.
At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as fortifying dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to be climbed first about 500 meters in height in humid heat and then climbed again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage in Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived in the late afternoon at the Freiburg Cathedral and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening mass in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by the co-operator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when Brite wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men's sprint at Velodrom in Rio when the British team defended the title of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. Jungspund made the legend proud when he stormed home to take home a victory from New Zealand’s favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the World Championships in London in March, despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in time when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
However, after his lap, Kenny was barely back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at Kenny's and Hoy's side, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately fell on the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags in the grandstand."
We've been together as a team for the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that expect us successful five days in Velodrom.
With the form Kennys it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go for over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win on your own.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal contest of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the finish line in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, in which Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had been arguing with officials yesterday before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time of 4:13,260 in the women's competition that will continue and finish tomorrow.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a host of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas took place in the background, such as the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and bullying allegations as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.
Future of the Portland smelter due to the cancellation of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium melt in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs are at stake in the Alcoa plant in Portland.
No less than 2000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be at risk if closed.
In addition, domino effects could occur, as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, leading to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa smelter in Portland loses money and risks closure.
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently as a result of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the plant to continue operating in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity from the smelter," the company informed.
AGL also stated that the contracts were so-called "security transactions", which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"As a result, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on revenues on AGL from the GJ 18 onwards are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual closing of $187 million in "expected termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts did not affect Alcoa's "ability to operate the smelter or to provide power to the smelter."
The U.S. company said that it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even though it is still guilty of a statement of why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland smelter plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Referring to analysts' statements earlier this week, Stephen Mikkelsen, Head of Operations, said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity a year, and Tomago consumes around 900 megawatts of electricity a year.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
And it wouldn't be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and running at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," wrote Kendall.
The unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?) scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the Rob and Caitlyn problem cases as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) as she forgets her sister's cover and ends with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest put the sentence, "You thought we'd forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a radio station at 8 a.m.), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a size that resembles a picture book rather than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages of the 832 pages of the Wälzer were advertising).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leaked before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "famous models" than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the small chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to make a good snapchat video (even if everything is true of Jenner).
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't appeal to everyone.
Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense with her reality TV story.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, criticized and called her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the displeasure seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
In the truest sense of the word, she's a supermodel.
It runs for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your primer from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she is on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Community law centres reject 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country's most needy are rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is focused on the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need of help, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogation and the like - are already rejected in their requests for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-exploited, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of Queesland Community Law Centres James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centres revealed that thousands of people have been rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the resolution of the Federal Government being lifted.
"Queensland's community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature, and this elevation shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Federal Justice Minister, as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis, to lift these cuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their client communities, and that the Palaszczuk government invests in this important work.
Donald Trump’s election campaign accused after employee allegedly pulled weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had targeted a firearm on an employee in February while they were on a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed in the Charlotte District Court on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini claimed to have waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, " drew a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run into Vincent's knee throat," Bordini stated in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leaders, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," Bordini stated.
The prosecution comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the Second Amendment people - gun owners and gun friends - should take action in case his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and appointed judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint demands damages from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press spokesperson Hope Hicks could not be reached for a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not responded.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the governing parties SPD and CDU are evident.
This resulted in representative surveys by the INSA opinion research institute for the "Image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could rule just further in the north, this is not possible according to the polls in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have good chances of remaining the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party was only close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 per cent (previously 18.4 per cent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the Landtag at 19 per cent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens are moving back to the Schweriner Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only be 23 percent in the Berlin parliamentary election (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It would thus still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Representatives at 14 percent.
At 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, whereas the pirates would miss the move-in in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.
The built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" entered the stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow originate from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
But 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as a "office in pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could reach a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.
Even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser, although agonizingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 Euro.
The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's changed since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The phone business of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and handled to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by vendors who all came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is everyday life for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which 555 million were sold on Samsung and Apple alone.
The worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
Added to this are the well-running business of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
In the meantime, a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone.
The major breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple's triumph began, and the iPhone is still the company's most important product today.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had a look.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian providers like Samsung now have the say.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for staff on the Siemens board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered both a curse and a blessing.
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow's biggest attraction, just as it was back in London in 2012, when we worked hard to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement in Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in growth and leave behind a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to the T2 built in the middle of the world's two most frequented catwalks.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time we steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
According to one of the software manufacturers, for companies that make money with online advertising, attempts to bypass ad blocking are equivalent to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus posted a blog post stating that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the encoding of its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect ad blockages as to which part of the advertising page is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock's spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back and forth fight between the ad-blocking open source community and the surrounding community has been going on since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has become involved in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicators have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use display blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's social network and Instagram mobile app, a speaker reported.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worthwhile investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preferences tool" to give people more control over advertising targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we are planning to address the problem," said a Facebook spokesperson in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman run over on Swiss highway in case of suspected suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call on witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday in a suspected suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the ground.
Several drivers have already been interrogated, but some have still not been identified, said the police, asking them and every witness of the incident to report.
Gilles Hofstetter informed Le Tribune de Geneve of the opening of an investigation, which is a "logical" step in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be reported.
Was a collision avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where one person was walking on the highway in the dark - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent killing after she ran over and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and passed out on the street, heard the court.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has any further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could once have exhibited earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly continued to rotate.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent more dull.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the Sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those of the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect was left -- the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as the Colorado Avalanche's coach and vice president of of hockey operations on Thursday and led a lack of co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative president/general manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations at the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I've been thinking a lot and a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it needs it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
It must also have the right to participate in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not being met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was named the best coach of the league at the 2013–14 Avalanches.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season, falling five points behind the Wild for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference.
As a Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups—two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strikes
Labour disputes regarding the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all parties to the dispute are sitting at the table for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day sessions in the next few weeks, which will start early next year in order to address the problems anew.
The unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group reduced its rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut follows a 10-percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has dismissed thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it rationalizes its operations as a result of its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars rotate at different rates in the star cluster, as well as the correlation between rotation periods and the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which were formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades' "ballet" we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the cluster of stars is so close to the Pleiades, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us about what we would like to learn more, how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes", so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12th.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time all-star game participant in Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was named the most valuable player in the league three times, and won the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signature under a ten-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he has made some milestones.
With the Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar scores in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the fame hall of baseball.
Because as successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
As early as 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal, he was suspended for 211 games until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is regarded as the main suspect of having received performance-promoting remedies for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league might even have done me a favor for 2014, because I have played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said in a suffocating manner at the time.
His farewell days are not silent either.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi etched.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to be in relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy expressions from fans of Yankee Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Got it: Because of a positive doping sample, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping events.
An athlete who got caught almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping events became known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle skater Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - just before the beginning of the already critically eyed athletics competitions, these news come at an untimely pace.
Chen had already been diagnosed last Sunday with diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Court of Sport CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the 50 m freestyle preliminaries.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B sample and for a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will work with the International Court of Sport CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC but the CAS that is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio the news of the positive test at Danekova leaked, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," said the track and field athlete.
According to the report, the banned substance is supposed to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was suspended for the time being, according to BNT the B-sample was already positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov spoke immediately with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping burdened nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" became known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days before, like his brother Tomasz.
Both contest the intake, but both must not start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletics, the Danekowa case in particular is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF had banned the start of the entire Russian team, except for one exception because of systematic doping, and the Kenyan runner nation also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous crimes in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to vomit," Lacourt said on the French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of an engagement with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping cheaters," he said.
Sun had been tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to serve a three-month lock.
Data Stealing: So Perfide Hackers Extort Their Ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of an attack using blackmailer software at least once in the past 12 months, sometimes several times.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
According to the observations of malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks in corporate networks.
If they succeed there, the ransom that is potentially extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing an alarmingly fast evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in a conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has taken place terribly quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt their business completely, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in the company.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, the security researchers at F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and the contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that there are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then seek out more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers to spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better back up their data.
Over 50 percent of the corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on the ability to fend off ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful ejection, the perpetrators will instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that, depending on the type of data, the damage potential is still many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also pick up completely new targets on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get control of a thermostat connected to the Internet.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating system could well be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the rear, it does not seem narrow at any point.
The materials of the interior are well-crafted and seem pleasant, only the cockpit upper side falls off there.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of storage space.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l available for raised and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The seats of the back seat can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The boot can be loaded well, but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he may do his work a little quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasant.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre gasoline engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive".
One of the safety systems is the City Emergency Brake Assist (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the Lane Stop Assist.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when shunting.
The main beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed control reacts to traffic sign recognition and, if necessary, reduces speed.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, App integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to achieve.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued that liability is only conceivable in the case of risks typical of air transport (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk to life, the court said.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Sickness case: When does the organizer pay
After their journey, patients will only get money back if the cause of the illness is clearly to be found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, a family was seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish leave.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which had allegedly polluted the sea water.
The family felt that the trip was defective - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs did not succeed.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was fine.
He therefore did not violate his information obligations, according to the verdict.
Especially as no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state had to react calmly and decisively to terrorist threats at the same time.
It is certain that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not allow this triumph to be granted to the terrorists.
However, if criminals had to leave the country faster, this would increase security and also strengthen the popular support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further strengthening of the security forces, "on a medium four-digit scale over several years".
Sympathy promotion for terrorism must be punished again.
The aim is to improve video surveillance and to amend the law on arms so as to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
According to de Maizière's words, the last much-discussed duty of secrecy for doctors is to be maintained.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wanted to find solutions to reduce the risk to citizens, he said, for example, with regard to mental disorders.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
De Maizière plans to use covert investigators to prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet).
SPD leader Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior had spoken out clearly against actionism.
"This was a slap in the face for the sharp-shooters in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on burqa and the abolition of double nationality.
He considered a general ban on full veiling to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
One could talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green leader Simone Peter accused the Minister of wanting to simulate the power and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet of sayings and a tightening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people of this country".
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It is regularly stuck on the bypass - here a picture of November.
But this is to change: the right-turning lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when driving via the motorway (A 43).
The Landesbetrieb Straßenbau will extend the right turn-off lane by 700 metres next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße.
Drivers can then thread directly from Hammer Straße to the right.
The big advantage is that traffic splits up more early, improving the overall flow on the busy section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The narrowing of the roadway on the feeder irritates the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.
On weekdays, the backlog reaches up to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is steered only one-lane over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be dismantled a good three-quarters of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to accommodate heavy goods traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated working day traffic jam will last cannot be said by the responsible national company.
However, years are to be expected: because the bridge has an official remaining service life until the year 2034.
For the extension of the right turn-off lane, the state enterprise deliberately selected the less traffic-friendly time during the school holidays, because with disabilities could be expected.
The traffic will pass the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday in one lane.
Intercultural travel: cultural activities for schools
The international class of the Waldschule attended the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus attended a performance of the award-winning play "Das Invisiblee Haus" of the Junge Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima Association, 19 students between the ages of eleven and 15 visited the production at the Kleine Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most young people in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic pictures and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Junge Theater Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee and migrant background between 14 and 20 years of age will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre and theatrical language teaching are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: hope for weather improvement
The weather in the south-west of Germany made a dash through the bill on the night of Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was bad for observing the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will see many shooting stars in the sky.
The star scales are perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips against Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep even far before the alarm rings.
This is far from relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently feel that their sleep is not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders and they can be caused by a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood by this is the insomnia, i.e. a sleep disorder.
Many people feel that sleeping through it is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Association of Family Doctors with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Organic, psychological, or behavioral factors, as well as medication, may be involved.
Not infrequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is common, especially in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are related to each other.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you may feel bad, wake up every two to three hours, and perhaps start pondering about everyday problems and worries, give Weeß an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to a doctor with trouble sleeping?
If you do not sleep well in at least three nights a week for a period of one month and if you are impaired during the day, go to the doctor, advise Weess.
The impairment can look quite different: one is tired, sleepless, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any nursing doctors in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine centre at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Weeß advises that in case of sleep problems, first contact the family doctor.
He can check whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what's happening?
For example, doctors are advised to study in the sleep laboratory when snoring with breath dropouts, when sickly tired during the day, when sleepwalkers or when one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, explains Fietze.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just please don't sleep for lunch," says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
Next to the electrodes on the body you wear a nose goggles, a chest strap and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a few adjustment screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and getting up, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping in the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - because then you start to calculate immediately, and that is not at all beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the World Short Track Championships in Doha and set his first world record at the same time.
Now former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has stood up via Facebook to protect himself from his critical ex-team colleagues.
"In a country where an Olympic winner receives a prize of 20,000 € and a Jungle King 150,000 € no one should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The conveyor system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This does not allow us to compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look very closely or even do so on the subject of doping.
"I am not saying that controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered with the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA) nine months before his first start.
That's exactly how it should be with countries.
"Those who cannot be controlled by independent inspectors of WADA/FINA for a certain time before WM/OS may not participate," demanded the election Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream parlor.
Airport: gang of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, two women and two men aged 50 to 61 were arrested by the Düsseldorf police.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage thefts as a gang.
At around 9.30 p.m., civil officers in the Düsseldorf Airport area recognized a gang known to police officers from past theft crimes.
Since the middle of July this year, the two women and two men had committed several crimes, and they had done so jointly, in part and particularly professionally.
The specialists of the crime commission 34 can prove four acts to the thieves, who had entered Germany specifically for the commission of crimes.
They had captured a total of more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between a remnant of cobblestones: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this at first glance, but the police count it as one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the street from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a organic store.
Someone sprayed "ugly" on the facade of a grey house.
Opposite a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here.
Articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are, however, preferably illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor rooms are still occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Senator for the Interior, Henkel, had spoken out several times in favour of a hard action by the police against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
On June 22nd, after the rooms on the ground floor, the cadder forge, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police reportedly patrolled for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and one day later the police and construction workers left under the cheer of sympathizers and local residents.
This summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
They share the concern about rising rents and gentrification with the residents of the house projects.
It doesn't sound like a neighbourhood that mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The trench opened by the Berlin interior senator and the police between squatters and their neighbors apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class quarter, which today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße, very close to the Rigas.
While the Mainzers had been evacuated under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still occupied by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world in recent years: residents from GDR times and former squatters now share their neighbourhoods with them.
This is also reflected in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols of this development: they can be seen by thrown-in windows or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.
No other street was mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-wing autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbours regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: According to statistics, crimes such as assault are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes are property damages, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenement house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.
When it comes to violence, she is appeased: The people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly were not.
Even the famous burning cars have not been in Riga for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than from anywhere else".
Neugebauer has deliberately moved to Rigaer Straße - and stayed.
That's why it was so important to her that the residents get their streets back: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the power of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road is still being taken away from them: faceless new buildings in former building blocks that displace the old inhabitants.
"In the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well-conceived live here," she says.
"Violence and destruction I absolutely cannot approve."
But what should you do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry about paint bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the neighbourhood.
If you move here, you should be aware of it - just like someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organiser.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a point of contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine Kunde from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying wool milk sow, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less mocking than aiming at the large number of desirable tasks - had meant when the administration wanted to announce the position.
An administrative expert with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought, precisely an egg-laying wool-milk-sau.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organisation, working with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been with us for about six weeks.
It has limited a 50 per cent post to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, "that Annika Deuschle supports honorable and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.
Soon new containers will be in Wasenstraße
For some time now, it has been a serious problem to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognised.
The local authorities are responsible for the connection.
They must house the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to Kommune and Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find any private dwellings.
It has not yet worked, according to Deuschle, that one needs private apartments.
Therefore, community homes must be upgraded, as they say so beautifully.
So soon new containers will be placed in Wasenstrasse.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent place of residence, it is internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More seats would be good," says Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help janitors, do charitable work - and this is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will have a positive impact.
This is "no occupational therapy".
But activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So the administration and the volunteers are jumping in here too.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures was a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it takes time and that they can meaningfully bridge the time, for example with language courses.
Anyone who develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also problem cases, says customer honestly, "people with nothing at all." Therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always also to motivate others.
It's all a mammoth task.
A difficult question: after the recent events, are they afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some may call naive." However, a residual risk cannot and does not exclude it.
But the helpers are already sensitive.
These incidents were also the subject of the refugees.
They'd be afraid the assassins would completely discredit them.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and volunteers have to look for activities on the ground and in the region.
They always have in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
Politics is afraid to answer this question clearly.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the ground.
"We have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunden also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the previous people in a sensible way.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Burglars wanted by helicopter
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessful.
Two unknown men forced into an apartment in an apartment house in Lindenweg at 8:50 a.m. on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two of them and ran away from the disenchantment.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled downtown.
The police used several patrol crews as well as a police helicopter for the search.
The search went without success.
The unknown may have been noticed before the action near the apartment or when they fled.
