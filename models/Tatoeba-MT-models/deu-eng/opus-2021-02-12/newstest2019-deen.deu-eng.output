Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Munich-based" candidates deliver with people photographer Tuan during the shooting and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting is available in the video:
DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other like that in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the now months-long debate about the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be the case until a certain point in time," said Grindel.
In July, De 29-year-old Grindel had declared his resignation from the DFB team, and he also explained that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't come about so far".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2.13 p.m. the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in arrears.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire at the arrival.
The roof had to be removed practically completely and fire debris had to be removed to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery for charging at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, for the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open street
What has led Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to take the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live as she apparently wants to take the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan chases the parents and their children.
It accuses the adults of trafficking children.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video following the family along the street.
Apparently she's trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and giving Lohan a slap in the face.
With tears, the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of deaths on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are reported.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Chairman of the Supervisory Board
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla boss Elon Musk caused trouble in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletroautobauer.
The U.S. stock market supervisor sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain Chairman of the Board.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharply guarded - the Party Congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The congress is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they've come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population is voting on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meant Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is thus in the lead in the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry journal "Automobilwoche".
In December 2017, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was detained and on leave of absence, had announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine/gearbox combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018," he said back then.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in the process of reassessing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made "gravity organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities accuse the Audi chief of having approved the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values after the announcement of the exhaust fraud.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently Chief Sales Officer Bram Schot heads the company as acting Chief Sales Officer.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronner Voice".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations available.
Grindel aspires to re-election - Lahm is to be elected to the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" on early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "remarkable" if, after the award for the European Football Championship in 2024, he did not "have the desire to work on the future project".
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM Chief Organiser Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise on this role in the Bureau in the future and would of course be cordially invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
In speculations whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migrant background should become DFB's integration ambassador.
Currently, this office is carried out by the Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says, "the issue is important, we have to take care of it," this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Decrease correctly with half-wise scales
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
Muscle and bone mass can also indicate it.
The body mass index is calculated by the thing, but it's more for the sausages.
Doesn't he say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscle?
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up easily won with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
With 20 points, Rokas Giedraitis was the leading scorer in Berlin.
Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators in his debut match.
Ex-master Brose Bamberg won the compulsory match debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower at the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most striking shooter in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
==References====External links==*BDFutbol profile*BDFutbol profile*BDFutbol profile
The new gamemaker Will Cummings surpassed the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweiger, where NBA star Dennis Schröder is majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were in action - among them also snipers.
The Islamic Association of Ditib is in criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrrufe und Schrecksecond
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 600.000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and I'm ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a moment of terror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shooting, getting scared, and trying to escape.
In a short while, panic arose, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one's trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to get one had to read and share texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience - boom calls for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as judge at the Supreme Court and thus pushed many women to the head.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape of Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women, who reportedly had experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet me at any time in an elevator," Flake now said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends the journalist's dismissal
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the dismissal of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt wasn't the problem, Seibert told the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the process of the press conference.
The journalist's action had created a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
Because of this, he had arranged for personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of espionage activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blamed the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities either: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested at the beginning of September.
Recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but there are still lawsuits against them in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and handsomely: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is known for its humid conversations at the bar of Hamburg's harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller and her guests are toasting some beer, some wine or even higher-percentage drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory vocals.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "Der geilste Tag".
But the trip to the far north didn't get very good for the Municher.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed on it, the eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Directed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - findings that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Inas Night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And splash.
And the round of eggnogs that Ina throws at 3:30, let go too.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to fight the aftergrow.
They ranged from instant broth, fish buns or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the view of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not known how Ina Müller survived the nocturnal drunkenness.
Since she has been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and filth
The entrance to the 36 km long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hoodland in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette dumps, garbage and rubbish, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship railway bike path in the Red Riding Hoodland a more than inglorious sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also by others for a long time, according to the bicycle traffic officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Radverkehrsberat.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reported that he also contributed the topic to the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebrations on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but it also destroys the stalls: the posts are torn out of the ground, trash cans are demolished, signs are bent over, seat furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the main focus here is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "It may set the threshold significantly higher to attack common property.
This would, however, require that a police patrol should come by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
He needed to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequenting of the cycle path so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning track on the Haaße hill.
In case of traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older drivers and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for young and young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family together with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time albattian living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
According to District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, this contest is a novelty.
We have not experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters see themselves connected to?
Lake Hiltruper and Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.
The cultural station was also honored.
Time and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short remodeling breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke knew to report that the recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed a lot on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the favourites of the jury - so that others can listen to their songs.
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer, who especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again in the finale - and even without electronic support they sounded "real good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
She considered the event a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams sitting opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you - the old trick with the red slide - can only decipher once you have put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Second window.
Third cube.
4. Fest".
These are the terms that now need to be encrypted.
Because here we should not guess the terms, but codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encrypter.
He's getting a code card that might say 3.4.2.
In "Decrypto", it is not the terms behind the secret foil that should be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "fix" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible not; because this wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The encrypter notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he took care of the school and knew the window collapse there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the opposite side - but you can better combine them with any clue the encrypter gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, the inscriptions should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre-primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's only about guessing and not about winning points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection of Kulmbach twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute in the Upper City of a passing police patrol, later he also appeared in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized did not comply with the assigned place reference by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he then has to answer for the use of marks of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig plant was home to the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
"When buffers popped at buffers, it was heard all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archived the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squealed and the wagons squealed.
That was just a railroad.
Statements that symbolize Spelt's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its apex in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres.
In order to cope with this, train and push locomotives were needed in the past, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901 the Bavarian parliament approved the construction of a railway depot with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, overhead line and railway mastery.
"The heart was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railway.
From the railway depot (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were also operated.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and push locomotives.
From 1977 onwards, they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10,000 weighings were still in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were broken down, and in 1991 the rest was broken down.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not considered better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated its 50th anniversary of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld, a pompous station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the down.
On June 1st, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the marshalling station Pressig was history.
"The shunters and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have already reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing like Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent in the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina, when the Russian put at number 13 gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
In the context of the series "Art and Pleasure", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special opening "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" in the context of the series "Art and Pleasure".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the opening.
He's been with us since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
A little surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task into proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have been active in the selection of artists in the past and have been involved in designing flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is again a 70 cent special stamp, which they designed, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
As you walk through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property the visitor is on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully provided with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object looks magically sunken and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to devote herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in motion in the wind.
Halfway, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy-figure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albanians: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also breathed their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more Sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albanians from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It will be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Especially for the anniversary they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it became, festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats in the "House of Encounter" as usual, but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was announced: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It's a matter of honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten let the voice sound.
To the occasion cheerful songs were announced.
Almost already set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today".
Matching to the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer wine".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hopping".
Richard Homann, who is one of the fives who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was once again sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece he performs."By the way, this time not only men presented themselves vocally.
The female choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes especially Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a large raffle.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the Allwetterzoo to the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The ascender's marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring finds itself really well in league three.
There's no sign of shyness or freckling, the independents are doing their thing.
And this at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really well.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we already made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring this to the finish line, such a game can tip," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side of such a derby.
It won't break our necks.
I have seen really good volleyball in stages," Annacker did not argue with the 0:3 - and went straight to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents, seems not foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with Regional League Volleyball." In the fourth league, they no longer want to look down.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will arrive in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series could have had a complicity in her marriage out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went off board forever.
The series, which made her a star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she had been married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," Keller tells in conversation with the "Picture on Sunday".
At first she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been quite envious, but "how many men did Hans shy away from talking about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have disguised myself", as she explains further.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman, who in truth I never was, even though I sometimes seemed bold and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I was in the dressing room crying and trying to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why didn't it ever work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively."
The moth, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the glaring shine in which a green carpet has been dipped on the six-blade square blinds him excessively.
But it's just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he stumbles over the square to make himself easier in the "Aquaclean-WC oasis".
This is what the public toilet system, sponsored by a large sanitary company, is called, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The need center on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the Lord's Oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have just entertained at the best level in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book", celebrate the festival start with a party in the three-storey department store just like every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: The works shown are from the whole globe.
What do you not have to think of in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into sneak advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a small volume around the feelers, which a good fairy has attached to him, and two bully bouncers actually wave him in in a generous way.
Inside, the invited crowds rush, dance to live music far after midnight, or let DJ rhythms dictate to each other, and rinse exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the Souterrain, oysters wait for slurring mouths, next door, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is gushing up.
And the hammer is: All the shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The moth studies the sign at the escalator: "Carry a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If that's two separate instructions, he's mistaken in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it certainly has already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry tilts a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who's been promoting that brand for years, isn't here that night either.
But there, between local celebrities, cash desks and kitchen items, a face that appears familiar to the observer passes: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His leading actor shouldn't have gone far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, with almost sixty almost like a choir boy.
They don't talk to him, they don't look at him, they just steal.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as a tangle, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dance
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is pleased about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled in well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to cumbia rhythms, as shown in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
On Saturday, the Mexican second division had defeated the Leones Negros with 2-0.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Sending after last minute break "destructed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: " Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destructed" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - failure - the fourth in the fourth match - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we totally overslept", the ASV trainer was annoyed.
The owners of the house led quickly at 8:1, even the early time out, which Bieletzki had taken, at first did not bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
For the break, the gap was only two goals.
Sending's Bester, Marius Hintze, in particular, arrived in the phase one by one.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst turned out at the 15:15, then the relay changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then?
Engage the impartials in the action.
Bieletzki usually avoids being blamed on others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff collected was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four times until the end - while the decimated ASV failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well against seven men in the back and kept throwing at the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said the completely served Bieletzki.
ASV gate: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Missing woman for 30 years - Police dig after body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old woman from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the woman's remains.
On Saturday, forces dug up a road near Marxgrün.
To this end, the street pavement and several layers below it were removed, as the police and prosecutors shared.
New evidence suggests that the missing person may have been buried not far from where she was at that time.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
Investigators didn't rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court is working intensively on the case together with the prosecutor's office.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monuments Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a remarkable under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officers bordered the spot on a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. stock exchange supervisor SEC filed an out-of-court lawsuit on misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk also resigns from the position of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
He is allowed to remain chairman of the board.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also head of SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, who is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk had explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He had always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market, paying 420 dollars per share, the financing was secured.
Tesla would have been valued at a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, appoint two independent board members and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communication.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel to be Chancellor by 2021
After the scrambles of recent weeks, the GroKo collects several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in an interview - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one meter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only get 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
According to Emnid, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes if the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday.
This means that the large coalition has lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently receive 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
Among the other parties, the range is also wide: The AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, FDP 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the vote.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens still find that Merkel is the right one in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wishes that the grand coalition will hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, with 41 percent in favour of a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also showed a marked loss of popularity for Merkel.
Divided, the Germans also judge whether Merkel should again run for CDU chairmanship in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
Thus, 64 percent of the Union's supporters want candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Hang out at Aldi: reduced price for love happiness
Does Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a meeting place for the great love almost exudes an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargain at the root table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being not so much a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react, you don't talk around the bush for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Rule-right Hollywood Lovestory potential has it if love happiness is preceded by an out-of-the-eye lost-and-found plot.
If the guy also gets in touch with his adored friend under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and co-sorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in an unknown Aldi branch to wish that she will find her dream man with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
She definitely deserves her happy ending à la Hollywood for believing in the magic of getting to know each other.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has been participating in the action "Device against polio - 500 lids for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The illness, called polio, in German, leads from paralysis to death.

Football: Reus and Zorc call for peace for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about form and fitness by Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn't do us any good," said Reus, a friend of Götze, after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen on TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.

Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard with his own.
Wortkarg gave himself, the coach of the football district club VfL Wolbeck, retired for the first time (internally) to ponder about the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
It's all history.
Meanwhile, it is again running around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer example is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only very thinly scrapped past the ascent.
Yes, I'm very pleased with the performance.
"We narrowed down the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and went to each individual after the match to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly over into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes in the front line waited for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more playing parts in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
This almost took revenge when the SCA hit dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Kasten in minute 41 two times in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break the VfL took over the full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed scarcely.
Schroer was also late after 58 minutes with a Thewes entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch again missed a fresh cell cure on the left side.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the courtlords 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The fouled man himself appeared and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right flap hit bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 more minutes, which should be damn long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather to his hand unhappyly in the 80th minute in the penalty room.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
In the final phase Wolbeck had to survive a few minutes before Geske had the victory hit on the push in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Helicopter crashes in Kottingbrunn
At the landing there was an accident on the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m., a drama took place on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
When a helicopter landed, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was captured by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a standstill on the side.
Police, rescue and fire department were immediately notified.
With a large order the forces came to the accident site.
The ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The precise circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigation.
According to firefighter Franz Resperger there was a small fire, which could be deleted quickly.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of September 1st, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which was officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
"Companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise international competitors will pass them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
In comparison, the gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking.
It's a different corporate culture.
Furthermore, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was due solely to positive impulses in the medium-sized enterprises index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would not continue to make a commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If just as many women were recruited for the board of directors every year, a share of 40 percent would have been achieved by 2023," the report says.
Some even make mischief: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?

Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros operating profit with each car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, comes only to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley put on even with each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already proppenvolle Festzelt. "For 60 years, this is an amazing achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of this," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Weinprinzess Lisa II. later symbolically kicked off the stage with the guests.
"It's nice that so many have found their way to Abtswind again." Later, "The Troglauer" created a mood.
On Sunday, on which Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the drinks prices in the afternoon on the occasion of the anniversary as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before one day later in the marquee in the second round.
In Bonn: Emergency doctor car crashes in taxi
An ambulance is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured in the collision of the vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue mission took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an ambulance with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance car had run over a red light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided at a junction with the taxi that was driving at Green.
After the collision, the doctor’s car hurled at a traffic light tower and a tree.
He captured the passer-by who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency personnel.
The 29-year-old notary, who was also severely injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency doctor called in tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, investigate who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we find it uncomfortable
After the embarrassing break in the league cup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat should still be talked about.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot the 3-1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defenders stopped and allowed Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of a previously long-distance insufficient performance.
At present, the mood at Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City is quite different.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to a 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defense bar of the outsider for the first time for the home team.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer a leader in the table
==League career=====League Cup======League Cup======League Cup======League Cup=====References====External links==
As with the Cup-off, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's match in the 25th minute remained the only match of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, barely missed the match after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds had started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea was not able to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and through the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the league.
Like City, London City Clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart was unhappy with Alex Iwobi's entry into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal.
Thanks to the fifth consecutive victory, Arsenal passed Watford and is now immediately behind the big rival Tottenham in fifth place. Wolverhampton continues to make a strong impression under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and finished 8th.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show under the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be presenting their new products from next week along with competitors from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not really play a major role in this.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should still be an important topic at least behind the shining backdrops of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz will be there with their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstädter will be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
But both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext will not start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
A good one million visitors came in 2016.
During the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, there has been enormous damage.
After the earthquakes, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu hundreds had gathered on the beach for a celebration.
It is feared that the number of victims is still rising significantly.
So far, the figures have only come from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other municipalities affected - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorrad-Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and therefore responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season at the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
Already from 10 o'clock the Bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first the biker's early soup was on the program and it could be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given by Father Dirk Grzegorek during the biker service.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical accompaniment.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill rather beats poetically and calmly," says Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday.
Fuchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big festival: After the apple comes the milk
And also at the actual day of action Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice to his amazed spectators.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children were yet able to imagine how to turn it into a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Wrapped in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked over each other the apple pieces, which look a little like häckselgut, layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not that difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the farmer had already finished filled specialties with him.
So he opened his "Treasure Box" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Fuchtorf" was correspondingly large.
In a cosy atmosphere the parents got into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discover the bouncy castle for themselves.
Also active members of the Fuchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games.
The Heimatverein will also offer a day of action in the coming year.
Then, however, according to Gregor Krützkamp, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: after all, the milk will then be around.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season break: "Break situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, much positive was not to be seen in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and pushed: "That's disappointing, of course, because you always do a lot of things."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met the connection, stand with two counters at the very bottom and are in their current constitution a candidate for descent.
Leading by the outstanding Ante Rebic, however, Frankfurt celebrated its first home victory in the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who, after the successful rehearsal for the European League game against Lazio Rome, advanced to the middle of the table with seven points.
Croatia's second world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessen and never to get a grip on Hannover's defenses.
The striker, who had been beaten for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, Allan, who was loaned from Liverpool FC, was in the initial formation of the Frankfurters for the first time.
Lucas Torró's (17th) headball falsified on the net for the first time brought danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back) on short notice.
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty room after a fenced-off corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to stop his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the defender AJ Auxerre who came in the summer.
And Frankfurt went back before the break.
This time, Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who was able to refuel and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the mid-time Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a little more courageously to the front, but sparking ideas remained out until shortly before the end, when at least the connection hit succeeded.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then put it across to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests only show runs, Jovic also met one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter made it to the millions at the opening of the 185.

Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or Sunday thereafter.
The feast service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who is from the 30-year-old war and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From this developed a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar room stands, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite its importance for the Geisinger parish, the service was poorly attended.
After the divine service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the feast of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting visitors to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided the visitors with savoury food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction work, which will last until next year.
Since the scaffolding has already been in place for some time, the damage has been detected more precisely and the individual tenders have been prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has increased, but more has also been found, which was only possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The base plastering works are completed, before the winter the natural stone works are to be started and it is hoped that more than half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" is handed over to its purpose - there were all present at the inauguration date agreed.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users, who have already been living in the residence of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time, depend on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officer building was put to the test for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in its equipment," Bader said in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
The Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both temporally and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between an accessible and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without any help from others.
The head of the social administration of the Schwaben district, Gertrud Kreutmayer, also said similarly: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need resources to be mobile".
The homeliness and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it is no longer to be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new residence in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square meters, which are divided into three residential groups.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schwesig complains of differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, Deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unit.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer than the people in West Germany on average, but would receive 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs reached their recipients on Thursday about a year old.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food in order to make it easier for the animals to get used to.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the Olympic Games in 2032.
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri rocket propulsion test facility as part of the mutual approach.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of commemoration, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archive, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Picture Book" of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New Week, New Chance for the Government
Back to substantive work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition that begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not at last mantra-proclaim the "return to substantive work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what actually is the difference between work and material work, but be it so.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its mandate - to govern - it should not be deterred from doing so with debate on concepts.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blemishes of the last few weeks will probably be shown by Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all the controversy.
First, however, there are again conflicting issues on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labour immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.
While a rapprochement took place over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned legislation on skilled labour immigration.
The SPD calls for a permanent perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "track change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
It is not equal and equal that has joined forces to form the GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
It's a good fight.
Without a dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
But in order to be constructive, dispute must not be built up again for party tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It's still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should argue - but always have the reality of people's lives in mind.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the lane change issue can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, that is why the People's Party must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in sight
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, violate the current law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" her legists had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprised - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question.
She assumed that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and did not want to announce any violations of the applicable service law in front of current cameras".
However, she now has questions to acquit Hartinger of any suspicion.
Police breaking a road in search of women's corpses
Marxgrün - Lange the police did not want to comment on it.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning there has been digging on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
Before that, the investigators had previously used an archeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its guide in repeated use, was finally able to narrow down the relevant area to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said street.
For more than a year now, the Procuratorate and Criminal Police Court have been working on the missing person case.
Again and again a cycle path was closed at Marxgrün and examined with sonar equipment, because the investigators suspect that in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago Heike's body could have been buried here.
Coloured Powder and Eggs: Riots in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But there are riots before that.
The separatists did not forget the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence Referendum on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked with paint powder by the independence advocates, among other things, in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 police officers from the Policia Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to use a rally to honor their colleagues who were in the polls last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
The attempt to prevent citizens from voting had also led to violence at that time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported the Spanish media.
However, some of the approximately 6000 separatists would have tried forcefully to break through the police chain and threw paint bags and eggs at the officers.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, according to the authorities.
On Monday, the first anniversary of the independence referendum will be held.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region from Spain, the central government in Madrid had forced Catalonia under compulsory administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also set out abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain under arrest.
New elections had been held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Congregated perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split up goalless
Red and white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
==References====External links==*FIFA profile*FIFA profile
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, the final light and the third last turned out to be a gathering of perplexity.
The first half was quite manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a torch, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty limit.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Sturmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 meters just over the housing and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a shooting of Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" the quickly performed counter about Sinan Aygün with a slick shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a headball from Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did nothing.
The Ahlener did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but she didn't make any money either.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero." But unfortunately the zero was also at the front.
"This time we weren't as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent didn't want to play here," stated RW Ahlens interim coach.
Offensively, "everything blabbed a bit" against a team that just wanted to defend.
At any rate, I didn't feel like we could get a countergate," Daut said.
To his sorrow, however, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Market: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for whom these donations are intended, are delighted.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky turned bright blue, while the space was still a little empty, but that was to change during the day.
Because: "It's so nice and sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizers of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a decent pinch of humour as always.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer intervened at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" could not be taken away from musically entertaining the more and more growing visitors.
This was so well received that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer was delighted.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased about the many active people with their stands, among them mainly clubs.
"Actually there should be no such thing as a blackboard," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were in action at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful painting - something works here.
Then the Maikranz was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarter.
Many stalls were used for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decopier saw.
Veneer work, beer lid with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought along by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a speciality.
Honeycake in glass, of course, with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
The conviviality is what made the visitors stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without the stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrication with local policy message: No successful advertising for skate facilities
In Lengerich, unknown people have probably hardly promoted the construction of a skate park in a beneficial way.
In several places there are corresponding lubricating plants, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been charged with property damage.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were displayed on signs, among others, at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering had already been discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt bistro after the trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message at the time was "only" left with an Edding, it could have been removed without any problems.
"A few days later, however, it was there again, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign has to be replaced.
This case in particular gets a special note by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There were already commitments, explained Jörg Hesselmann of the urban department School, Sport and Culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate facilities.
After the old LWL clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council finally spoke out in favour of the fire park by a majority.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
A turnaround followed at the end of June.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says on the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is then given to the city council.
It assumes a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Air traffic congestion is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European aviation chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of any improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, we will have strong wind in 2019 and then the storm comes," said Matthias Maas, head of the Air Traffic Control Union, to the German Press Agency at the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures was the long-known shortage of staff in European air traffic control systems, for which there was no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
The market for fully trained pilots is empty across Europe.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal government, the federal states, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, it won't work without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the Federal Air Traffic Control Agency.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot misere.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff savings for national air traffic control systems are now fully operational.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut the air off any further".
At present, EU targets would be agreed by 2024 and further tightening would be feared.
The EU was exposed to constant lobbying by airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high costs of delays would lead to a rethinking of the airlines.
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", Maas said.
The annual intake of 120 pilot pupils over the next five years, announced so far, is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staffing structure is not yet associated with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to Thyssenkrupp interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board of Management at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-stricken group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to have their headquarters in Essen and to be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff reductions beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory body has only eight heads on the capital side.
This is contrasted with ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50% share of the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demonstrations of police and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations in Barcelona by Spanish police and Catalan supporters of independence have resulted in violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, about 3000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police had tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a grand bid.
According to the forces, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
According to the figures, there were also ranges between the participants of the various protest marches.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute with their demonstration to the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly one year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they beat us up a year ago.
A 31-year-old officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights, and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Failing to allow access to personal data of British ministers
A vulnerability in a mobile phone app has resulted in the personal data of ministers and members of the Conservative British Tory Party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known one day before Tory Party Day in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
The police Hannover reported a serious traffic accident on Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed driving their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises for top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star stormer "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia", Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought-in star even without his own goal was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal templates, Juve turned the game after the early backlog through the hit by Dries Mertens (10th minute) and for the time being hung up the worst chaser.
The goal-hunter, who had been picked up by Real Madrid, first put on the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who managed the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preparatory work for the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.) after a corner by headball, who had only to push in shortly before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League as well as in the Portuguese national team the record goal scorer.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goal scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six points ahead of Naples.
The second place against Turin was coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti.
But at the latest after Mario Rui (58.) had already been warned, the lead was decided.
The Portuguese had to get off the course after too hard a climb against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed there.
The German national player has won over Juve.
==References====External links==*FIFA profile*FIFA profile*FIFA profile
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown out of the field in the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is closed for the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West attracted attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, one may only call him "Ye", according to the musician.
"The entity formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he took his stage name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
The tenth album was already released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you," says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
We did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more grippy, we almost never put him in trouble." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar shooting possibilities reads thinly.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, so games can only rarely be made positive.
Football Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after a great preparation by Krause he changed his position.
The hosts only had a double opportunity when Moritz Höne failed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the following shot Jan Blome also found his champion in Sendenhorst Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forgave.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann was also not able to use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line was the match decided (81.).
"We had criticized each other hard before, and that was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about it," he struggled for words.
"We didn't get access to them at all." By which he said probably the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-whites, which were noticed with a collective offensive urge.
Nevertheless, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and pulling from then on his players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, namely Albanians, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class preservation.
GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him with understandable mixed feelings.
"This was by far our best performance in the season," he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2, how we keep against one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
All the more bitterly it seems that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goal hunter Lars Zymner brought the hosts into the lead with his 12th goal in the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2-0 he put over the left side exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
"That was already madness what he did", Lewandovsky recognized the quality of the opponent without envy.
Shortly before the change of sides his own eleven managed to balance: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through to the long toreck (45.).
After the change of sides it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nubel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann settled out (69.).
Despite the excess, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten is what we now have to win," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Gates: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nubel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albrachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There were no winners in the Landesliga duel between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The team leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff stood very well and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Resignation of the entire Bureau of Dynamo Dresden
According to media reports, the entire Presidium of second-tier football player Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media alluded to a joint letter from the committee of Saxony.
There was no confirmation of the club at first.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to collect the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there as a guest.
For example, Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." However, the fact that celebrities often appear at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also an issue during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann is attending a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised to accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 conferences until mid 2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is written in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without limit".
Gun deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks every human idea."
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitalization.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions".
At a meeting on the occasion of the 200th
Karl Marx's birthday will soon be expected by some more visitors in the direction of criticism of capitalism, while others will rather expect a tendency "from left to center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Musical cabaret: gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret girl, Teubner precipitated gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat at the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes also comes up with words until the end of the movement, and on the other hand, he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies him so congenially harmoniously that some may have wanted a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely the way it fit the red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had brought into play a paradox: The satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: what would have emerged from Mozart's composition if "the Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G minor Symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers were presented to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not be taken away from an additional thank you.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police slightly reduced the number of victims.
10 instead of 15 passengers were slightly injured.
Everyone is now released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night to watch.
He was released in the course of the day, said a police spokesman.
The reason for the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus was unbraked frontal against a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG just keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems with Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals alone.
"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We couldn't handle them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
His team missed the concentration in the finale this time.
The ASG was therefore almost behind a lag until the end, at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.) behind for the break.
It was only towards the end that the broader bank of the hostesses became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put back room Merle Klement on left side, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top match at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top match, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
The Blue-Whites won with 3-1 in the second division of the VC Allbau Essen.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
Lenz plays in the top third of the league.
We have now worked on this," said coach Dominik Münch, delighted after an almost impeccable performance of his team with the overthrown leader in the standings.
The first pass was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-champion of the previous year.
Food took on in the bar of two, but it didn't come into play.
We've kept them busy.
Our opponent has opened with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen changed the assumption to three-bars.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food sucked up, and we let ourselves lull a little," Münch continues.
At the 18:17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had the first advantage.
Ostbevern won four sets at the 19:24, but the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," said the exercise manager to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played there consistently and calmly".
About 7:3 and 15:13 brought the blue-white passage four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dirtmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left behind a pile of pieces in the German-Turkish relationship that can only be laboriously combined," said Gökay Sofuoglu, chairman of the TGD, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides had missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of underlining the Muslims' belonging to Germany with German leaders, Erdogan has used the appointment for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The far-reaching exclusion of the German public has "reinforced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost exactly to the day it is then a year ago that we have carried out a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting was so fast in Nottuln eta.
No matter if Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"As always, the program at the next Folktreff is a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and seaman songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer promised his accordion for the first Folktreff "Birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, who played music with flat German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff will be happy to remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten inspired the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend once again a sociable and humorous evening," it says in the invitation of the home club.
If you play an instrument and want to actively participate, you are invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is recommended to be there early enough.
Folk Treff starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are making another step on the way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, informed Linde on Sunday.
This means that approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA are still pending for the multi-billion-dollar merger.
Recently, the chances of an insider's approval had improved there, because Linde promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding questions must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and state care was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses were set for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
Of course, it was then called "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" ("Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land") and was founded by mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit - growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit - growing, about flowers and horticulture no one thought at that time.
"At that time, during the Enlightenment period, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees were to line highways, so-called industrial gardens were built at schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But this is far from exhausting the spectrum.
A natural gardening, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play as important a role as the conveyance of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwügel" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said District Chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
Chestnut collecting was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with smartphone & co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"The district association decides where they should stand," added Landrat Söllner, emphasising the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, left no doubt about it even district managing director and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a presentation through the long history of the district association and reported among other things on the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was ingested.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has a lasting existence, it was there before us and we have to orientate ourselves to it", the expert pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is the incentive for the horticultural associations not to give up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline of insects, and we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta Talks: Canada's Foreign Minister Moves UN Speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they provide both trading partners with an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York due to the time pressure in the struggle for a reissue of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, their spokesman Adam Austen announced.
In the meantime, she is concentrating on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo had stated on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the US would have 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are to be brought to a conclusion, Trump's government wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-designate, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The extreme-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked on the street at the beginning of September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations against Bolsonaro's racist and women's contemptuous statements made themselves mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mingled with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As the ex-mayor of the megacity of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in politics, it has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round achieves an absolute majority, there will be a run-off election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully - no matter who he is competing against.
Bolsonaro is known to incite against homosexuals and blacks and to glorify the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he is shocked with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's Left Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe takes back Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup tale at the gates of Paris.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen reported on Larsen's website.
On the deathbed Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday as a "street boy" who "was against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared at the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark in 2010.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a rewriting of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock by three other bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of stage fright.
Afterwards the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all together with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands inspire the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito"-Rocknacht visibly.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already convinces with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD at the start of the concert evening.
In front of the stage the band dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "Admission" calls are not to be missed, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s, demonstrate that hard rock is not the same as hard rock.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates by the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishchen has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its appearances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China from 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheered solo to the sound that feels even higher than before, running through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, a part of this genre at such a hard rock concert: according to information from the mixing console team, the "Mint Mosquito" Rocknacht at the three-part concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at press air hammer level, but is still significantly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitvals", which "The Ignition" point to on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience doesn't need 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume as usual with the annual metal pitch in the north of the republic at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger", all three groups, of course in a figurative sense, can say in the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A glider crashed on Sunday in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim/Essen airport.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed on the fair parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the pilot is supposed to be a single-seater.
At the time of the accident, the plane had already been in the approach.
The crash site is only a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the border of the two Ruhrgebiet towns and directly at the entrance to Highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at major events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that US President North Korea’s leader Kim is well-disposed despite the nuclear crisis.
But now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married president of the United States has committed himself to a new flame.
Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in public on Saturday.
Before supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia Trump found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although it proves to be quite tough in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he was tough, too, and things went back and forth between us," Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announcement to stop all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
The US President seemed quite aware that the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - which is notorious for his martial threatening gestures - would not be easy for everyone.
In any case, he anticipated the criticism of this at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It's so unpresidial.
But he doesn't care much about it, Trump explained, and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I always told you that it's so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena, but we'd only have 200 people standing out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric as well as on top spoiled by sun full: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre was dressed up on Sunday.

Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya with the help of a mobile phone video, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under mortal danger and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in an attempt to get to Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself, according to his own statement, in mortal danger.
One of his comrades was beaten almost to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria had been sent back to their homes this year with the help of the programme, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
But he had not heard of a call for help via cell phone video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, dominated to a large extent by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front house of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase into the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher notified the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.
Perpetrator description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to spend several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central Franconia, after he had stuck the car away from all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing person since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
According to the figures, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a trip with his SUV across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search, the whereabouts of the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statements, called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns above all arrest waves, freedom of the press and religious freedom.
He therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this".
According to Laschet, he also referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Mr Erdogan then reiterated the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's airworthiness at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the discussion, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearisation of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Secretary of State Ri calls for Washington to come to terms with it.
North Korea's Secretary of State Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions in the UN General Debate.
"The recent stalemate is due to the US building on coercion measures that are deadly to building confidence," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there will be no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that sanctions could force North Korea on the "knee" is "a dream of people who don't know us".
However, in order to build trust, his country had stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed an atomic test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, there had been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict compliance with sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting did not give the many visitors of the House of the Open Door HoT anything: White blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet awaited the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power failure had put the huge two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to make it by themselves," says Westbuer.
And so everyone came along.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Cooks can't do better either," praised one visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people put together," emphasized Rev. Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen caused amazement with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board NRW of the board
Jörg Sartor, head of the Essener Tafel, has given up his post in the Landesverband out of frustration about criticism from his own ranks.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice-Chair of the NRW-Tables, Sartor told the "World on Sunday".
Too many fell in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Landesverband NRW, expressed his understanding of the dpa for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essener Tafel did it."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday" Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels.
One should not take the approach "without us the people in the city starve".
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve to death.
The Essener did not take part in a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet stuff," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who criticized me at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0 guided tour - Gmünder Tagespost

At 2:2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke wins against Mainz for the first time in the season (1:0).
(sda) Schalke has maneuvered four times in the first five league games with early opponents into the sidelines.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it had taken the first place behind the Bavarians in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after a lot of preparation by Evgeni Konopljanka, and the hosts then conserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had made a 0:2 loss against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half they still achieved a 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) matched with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublet in the final phase (86./94.) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
Werder Bremen was already decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in owner, which helped the guests to balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also no failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave Gladbacher a lead twice, finally played 2:2 and have been waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
==References====External links==*BDFutbol profile*BDFutbol profile*BDFutbol profile
At the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second hit after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
In the storm of the foals, Alassane Pléa proves to be a goalgetter.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase by OGC Nice took place for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the 7th match.
After seven laps Gladbach takes fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen maneuvered against the VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable situation.
After 19 minutes the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganese Anastasios Donis finished with his first goal in the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to gain his team: The 23-year-old Serbe collected yellow-red after a jersey match against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back into the game through a curious throw-in-owner (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the overcrowded Stuttgarters back on the Siegesstrasse.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course by means of Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia today, some 1.8 million citizens vote on whether their country's name should be changed to North Macedonia.
In a yes, the almost three decades-long smouldering conflict with the neighbour Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a change of name because of its northern province of the same name and had blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future West integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a member of NATO in the event of a positive outcome to the referendum.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three retirees and hurt them, some of them severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker ransacked at 10 p.m. on Friday in the escape street in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went out on passers-by with his fists clenched and tried to attack them, about his behaviour.
As a result, the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
A short time later it turned out that the suspect had beaten three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists shortly before in Währinger Straße at a tram stop.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered haematoma, contusions and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "image" newspaper that a registered partnership had not been considered for them.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had raised a stir on 30 June 2017.
Thus, he accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "tumbling" herself on the subject.
"That was your shabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the citizens' association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
Because around 400 meters hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Citizens' Association.
And there's been a lot of accumulation.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape cut.
The hedge has already been shorn in the spring.
The breakfast that always follows the work also has a long tradition.
"Everybody should stay strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the Canoeslalom World Championships
The Augsburg-based Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Canoeslalom World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympic track.
Two years ago he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the facility and it all worked out today," said the London 2012 Olympic third.
At the finish, he threw away his paddle with joy and raised both arms to the heights with confidence - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
However, the six remaining starters could not top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec took second place in front of the Russian Pavel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempt to break into a family home this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of this again.
So yesterday the police inspectorate Gauting reported the first attempt to break in this fall.
It is thanks to the alarm system that it stayed at the family house on Königswieser Straße.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system surprised them, however, to the extent that they took flight without prey.

Breaking with Hertha: Catched up with reality: Bavaria against Ajax demanded
The title is unbeatable: FC Bayern "does not want to let go of the defeat in Berlin".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance line under the new coach Niko Kovac should not increase to the larger autumn low for the Munichers.
"A week ago, you had the impression that we were invincible.
Now the reality has caught up with us a little bit," stated Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
If you know us, you know that this really pisses us off, and that's why we're pushing towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal was scored abroad, as at the same time as two compulsory matches in series without victory, the lead in the Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as at the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at the 1:1 with its running intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle-stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, how the last overpowering Bavaria can be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not let this happen and that we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," stressed Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he dealt surprisingly gently with his losers in his native city and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the once again inadequate handling of chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term positive before the international match break - otherwise the tone would probably worsen.
For example, Kovac did not take any extraordinary action before the second king-class appearance of this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round against Ajax begins as planned, which at the start had also defeated AEK Athens with 3-0.
"Now it caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke in particular plain text.
The legal defender appeared in the role as a reminder.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we also have to work it out again, because we don't make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old emphasized shortly before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh match day of the previous season, the Bavarians were already behind Dortmund with five points, which has now taken the lead again with one point advantage.
And so Kimmich said with a wink at least positively that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious accusations.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the power of interpretation in the permanent topic of dispute Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB leader defended the line of association.
On early Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the Causa in the ZDF "Sportstudio" in Mainz.
"In the future, because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams, we must draw very precise conclusions that this does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
He had harshly denounced a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they took pictures with me in England," Erdogan said in the cathedral city on Saturday.
To be honest, as its president, I could not digest the exclusion of our two young men who have ascended to the German national team.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonablely treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with Erdogan's photos.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to stand in front of players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm migrant - that's not possible.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer is to be appointed next to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says, "The issue is important, we have to take care of it," this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 am and 1 pm.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauter Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange since the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had left the road and was driving against a lead post.
Asked about this, the man did not want a police force on site and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has moved to his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and has rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car suffered significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and couldn't remember much more.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 operatives still in service.
About four weeks after the moor fire broke out on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 firefighters are still working on the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to be stable, according to a speaker, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was proclaimed a week earlier on 21 September, because it was feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and spark flight.
Thursday it was then said, an attack of the fire on adjacent municipalities no longer threatened.
At times, more than 1500 operatives tried to control the major fire on site.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for the 2nd and 5th of October.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets that had fired Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand had at times moved up to a hundred kilometers far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that receives damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "image" newspaper that a registered partnership had not been considered for them.
If we get married, we get married.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had raised a stir on 30 June 2017.
Thus, he accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "tumbling" herself on the subject.
"That was your shabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the adoption law.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the same name, the neighboring Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked Skopje's rapprochement with the EU and NATO as a means of exerting pressure.
If the citizens vote 'yes', they will also give the start to their country's Western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner from 1986 dies in the USA in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved in the case of Swisstransplant.
As in Germany, the new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
According to Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation, 15 percent of Swiss citizens are assumed to have a donor card.
But only in five percent of cases would a card be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, relatives do not know the wishes of the deceased.
"You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations of storing information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - per or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered an organ donor, unless he or she disagrees.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in brain computing
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in head computing.
He won the championship in Wolfsburg on the weekend against 39 competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, shared this on Sunday.
16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as main referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were: 14,130 214 x 17,981.822 or 57,809.355 + 28 x 16,448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already two years ago in Bielefeld as a 14-year-old.
With terms like superbrain, genius or prodigy organizer Laue can start little.
"Head calculation can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-based computing competitions.
Among the disciplines is, for example, the square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
In the case of versatility calculation, the candidates get surprise tasks, for which they have to find a solution strategy quickly.
The Germans would also have good chances here, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because there, even in early childhood, head calculation is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Intrusive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams shows herself from her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to point out breast cancer and to fight for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings on top without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of this.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about early breast cancer detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
When her daughter Alexis Olympia was born, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send a bill on the so-called "Symbols Act" in review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, they said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher mountain pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start their annual curing on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday.
The "green ramparts" that are unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for about 200 years.
The trees and shrubs up to five metres wide are "forest substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last retreats.
Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also comes from that time: By "knicking" the branches the dense, interlocked demarcations could develop.
Today, around 45 000 kilometres of hedges extend between the North and Baltic Seas and give the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a replacement habitat.
In one kilometer of kink up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, it withers to a light row of trees, which loses besides biodiversity also wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kink care may only be carried out outside the breeding period from October to March.
After tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia talks about local situation
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes occurred, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately headed back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and the gas stations are completely closed, people steal food and gasoline in part.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partly free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many dead bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who they do not know if they are living or where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but for example at work.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought, "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he did.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi lying on the Pacific Fire Ring not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had contracted a muscle fiber crack in the rear left thigh at the 2-1 match against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga football team announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle fracture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following season.
VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast of downtime.
A muscle break usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle break usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the film festival of San Sebastián, the dance of the most prestigious European festivals closes every year.
Despite all the singing on the cinema, one can sum it up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the Olching fire brigade tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action lasted for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers on Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water-guard station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire department.
The first attempts to capture the duck, however, went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a hearty handle.
The duck injured in the breast was then taken to the LMU Animal Clinic in Oberschleissheim.
But according to the initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard is aiming for World Cup medal
Biathlete Julian Eberhard was in fourth place at the Olympics for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the medal to grab.
Seven tenths of a second was missing in the end on bronze.
"I consciously took time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
You'll have to hit someday, too.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart", he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbospeed
Time is extremely short and the number of interviews planned is very limited.
With a turbo-tempo FBI investigation, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the ultra-thin majority for the coercive candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for investigators until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The latest turn in the drama about Kavanaugh's vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing with Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer threw out angry Tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Justice Committee was to clear the way for the final confirmation of the archconservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumult-like scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called Thursday's heavy pretensions still "disgusting", initially abstained from further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of "luck in misfortune".
In this way, he said, final doubts could be resolved.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply in an election rally because they reject Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely limited the powers of investigators.
One would specifically investigate the well-known accusations of two women, nothing more, a government representative told the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" in the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit is stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You have felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the factor of time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the Königsblauen had managed to bring the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season under control.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11. had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security Tedesco: "In total, the first half was good, both playfully and from pressing"., obviously with increasing playing time more and more the head played a role.
Don't make a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give this out of their hands and therefore kept retreating.
And defends against Mainz with a man and a mouse.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We have all fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man creates."
But in the end, all that matters is victory.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start powerfully in the initial phase and turn it into fireworks," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and bravely, so we have to play games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a shaking victory," said Tedesco: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
So I'm glad we won.
So he wasn't the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzach Valley 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From a distance of about two kilometres, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday at around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon discovered by the police and the fire brigade: an unknown person had lit garbage on a two square meter area on the Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, he seemed to have monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the glow unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy pulling apart and unloading.
The police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
Before them stands the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Cultural Policy" in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and one or the other joke, he brings one of the most conflict-rich topics closer to the audience: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts increasingly arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, while first-generation migrants sit at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always been sitting at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflict.
Therefore, it is not a matter of deciding whether to place oneself politically on the right or on the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, then more and more lively the discussion starts.
And there's a need to speak.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands before us, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "we can find solutions only if we understand what the problem is," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session, he also became an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and Giessen win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first match day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen won in a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.

The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champion Bayern München and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday for a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices is completed - similar to the former local model.
More than 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
"Currently the documents are checked", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Pliening, it is the goal to have the candidate ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
After that, the award could take place.
In total, 50 plots for single and double houses are being created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with an estimated eight housing units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and roads will soon be asphalted.
A single plot as well as two of the apartment houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two apartment houses in the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented housing supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated on the area of the new Landsham-Süd area, housing is created for about 200 people.
Not only that: now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start for the new building of a day care center takes place there.
It will house three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Thus Schalkes Naldo succeeds "great sport" also on the bank
For the third time in a row, not in the starting team: Nevertheless, Naldo would like to thank Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat for the third time in a row in the Schalker start-elf, but on the replacement bench, the understanding would have been great with many people, if the almost two meter tall Brazilian had really talked the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked all his pros for the head coach Domenico Tedesco, the 36-year-old, who all simply call Naldo, joined in and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite being a reservist again, did not hold any grudges.
Wahrscheinlích knows Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best Schalker, that he actually did not get on the siding with his coach - but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "burden control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'll tell you honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting elf.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco explained.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can take a breath right now.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that recently also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself to be an exemplary team player at the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry accelerated its decline in August compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands throughout Europe, the Markit Institute informed on Monday of its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still the 13th month in a row below the 50-point mark, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry hit this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
At the end were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March, with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry - in the third quarter at least - remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone did not fall as strongly as they did since November 2011.
The companies therefore lost jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
Industrial production in China also declined more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers' Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial enterprises.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, storage and prices are raised.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds eighth victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel hurries with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3–0 (1–0) thanks to two matches by Superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league match.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar took PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and made the final in the post-season.
==References====External links==*Official website
Thus Paris also succeeded in the dress rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the season, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory match defeat this season at the 2:3 in Liverpool.
