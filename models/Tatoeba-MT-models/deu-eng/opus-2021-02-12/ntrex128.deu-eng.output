Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
In the case of some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament) gives rise to dismay.
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to 'Welsh Parliament'.
National Assembly members of all political directions fear to become the target of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party National Assembly said that his group was concerned because the name rhymes with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.
For non-Valisian readers: in Welsh, twp stands for 'doof' and pwp for 'Aa'.
A member of the National Assembly of the party Plaid Cymru stated that the whole group was "not happy" and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the change of name, but pointed out the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in Yorkshire-speaking English.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Committee), which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: "The final decision on names for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which gave broad support to the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
With regard to the titles of members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) or WMPs, while the MWP option received the greatest support during a public hearing.
The National Assembly members seem to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle for a consensus could be a problem for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill within weeks.
The Reforms Act will include further changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of National Assembly members and for shaping the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may finally vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
On Sunday voters will decide whether their country's name should be changed to 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The referendum was set to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province similar to Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that it claims to be Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
"Today there are no more both."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People's social life today looks different," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhood, in which people regularly find themselves."
In the case of the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will "be back to the beginning sooner or later".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums in which people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be whites," he said, "and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that held their services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem who refused to hire or support black people.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they commissioned the Glockenspiel.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the Glockenspiel as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who rang the bell in July used other words: 'a treasure of culture' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first chimes played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger chimes in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, some of whom were drawn in by the lay leaders of the church and some by the bishop's diocese.
In July, the parish council – the community leadership committee made up of lay leaders – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass the costs on to the parish council, although it was not involved in the commission of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injured in California 13-year-old diving after Lobstern
In California, according to official reports, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy diving to Lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the channel KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy's cries for help and paddled to the boy with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought first that the boy was happy to have caught a praiser, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!
I have been bitten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy's house, he found that his entire collarbone was torn open.
“I screamed that everyone should get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’, Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The nature of the shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been seen in the area, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the torso area.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to push ahead with the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is attacking boats, Superdrug, and Debenhams with department stores filled with specialized assistants.
As part of a large-scale push to the £2.8 billion UK cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow while fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments will be tested nationwide in eleven branches. If they prove successful, they will be expanded to more stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search for supermarkets for ways to use store space previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, for the first time, the scope of its cosmetic offer doubles to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like Boots.
In addition, the supermarket is re-launching its "boutique" make-up series, making most of the products more vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test outlets in two Sainsbury's stores. The first store opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and a second one will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local consumer goods stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight against discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has set up hundreds of Argos outlets and a number of Habitat outlets, which has increased food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over the distribution of the profits from the drugstore dealer's stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the attractive environment and the favourable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases, which calls into question the previous way of shopping."
Peter Jones "raged" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a business worth £11 million
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is "raging" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million business with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessory brand True.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The "This Morning" presenter, 37, announced her withdrawal on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered "Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones with her very short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new follow-up contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "raging" when television's "Golden Girl" admitted, at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to their new business – worth up to £1.5 million – they could no longer devote enough time to the common homewear and accessory brand True.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would likely have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from True on Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure their long-term future over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to market launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" presenter, one of the UK's most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend their holidays together, and Jones holds a 40 percent share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is supposed to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV show "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night: "We are not commenting on his business affairs."
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would regard as "non-presidential" and for such positive comments about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news presenter:
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's senior diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the US maintained sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and repatriation of the remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population were displaced by Lombok, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for mobilising international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not want international support, so that is a bit difficult," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesman for the Civil Protection Agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international agencies should participate in the relief operations.
In view of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still badly prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, these are not an everyday sight on other coastal areas.
The apparently missing tsunami warning in Palu, despite a warning, has probably contributed to the deaths.
Traveling between Indonesia's numerous islands is a challenge in the best possible case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new catastrophe in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the core of his election campaign and has spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, which is seeking re-election next year, is suffering from financing deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure due to ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes and homes when gangs of Christians and Muslims fought each other on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores deep match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at his team's 0:1 residue, about 27 metres from the Chelsea gate.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sailed high above the penalty room and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"I was just trying to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for me," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw ledge coming and had contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
After a match in the 25th minute Chelsea led through the Belgian star Eden Hazard to the half time with 1-0.
The blues stormer gave a pass with his heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted to the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast doubles pass in the midfield.

Hazard left the defenders behind and ended up with a left-hand shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the back of the net.
Liverpool will be playing at the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will be in London on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in the UEFA Europa League Videoton.
Number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Civil Protection Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the debris of buildings that had been brought to collapse by the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on Friday, which had caused up to six meters of high waves, reported the official Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed
After finding a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask all those who have been near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken up something with a dashcam to contact us. They may have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have announced that they are about to inform the victim's next relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that now the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
It repeats time and again, 'this is so terrible'.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the barrier and another vehicle was in front of the barrier.
Within the barrier were several police officers who monitored the apartment block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and refer to the record entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament becomes the latest monument subject of the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious artefacts of England, reminiscent of the Taliban, by his fanatic puritanic followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell was targeted in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The picture storm in the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is proof of the 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who, according to many, is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today, as one who defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate presentation is the subject of ongoing debates on history.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in southwestern China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man to whom only the last name was called "Yuan" was found dead with a severed artery in the vicinity of a pigsty at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is getting ready to inject vaccines into pigs in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30th, 2005.
He was reported to have arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his muzzle.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighing 250 kilos had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin, to whom the last name was called "Wu," was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or to his cousin.
One market manager told Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent attacks on more people while the police were gathering evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities reportedly are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 290 kilos stuck a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could scare the animal away.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "sustainer".
“They’re just playful.
They like to tweak and are very curious ... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right level of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the USA
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens on the way over the colder water on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding in northern Mexico and the southwest of the USA in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. East Coast time, Pink had winds of 136 km/h, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form over the Pacific that moves east to the west coast of the USA. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the USA.
Rosa will cause up to 25 centimetres of precipitation on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity will produce widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest through interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous flood-like floods, debris floating in the water, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity sometimes leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, precipitation is expected to be up to 5 to 10 centimetres.
Due to the dispersion of tropical rainfall there is the possibility of flood-like floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the impending tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into torrents, and thunderstorms bring local gusts of wind as well as wind that carries dust.
The approaching trough brings heavy rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation of more than one centimetre is possible, which can lead to a small amount of debris floating in the water and to smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and lasts Wednesday.
In October, severe temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, in the middle of the USA, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the USA, a warm beginning of October with widespread temperatures around 27 oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the USA.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million viewers saw the captivating statements of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued. TV stations interrupted their regular program on Friday over a last-minute turn: an agreement negotiated by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, pressed her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen saw the hearing.
The company measured the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which broadcast the hearing, the figures were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audience numbers in offices.
To put this in the right perspective: This corresponds roughly to the number of spectators in a play-off football game or at the Oscar ceremony.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, recorded the highest number of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers at the full-day hearing.
ABC came second with 3.26 million spectators.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in the drama of Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras of CNN and CBS, as protesters in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee loudly harassed him with words.
He stood with his eyes lowered for minutes while he was being scolded. The scene was broadcast live at CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"You have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and added before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee was to vote on the transfer of Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would do so only on condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as demanded by the democratic minority.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations made against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to withdraw from the European Union of using Britain's future for political purposes and undermining the nation's interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her, published on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit by calling a proposal that provides for the mutual collection of duties by Britain and the EU "completely absurd".
Deadly shots at Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shots fired at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for manslaughter, according to Baton Rouge police.
The agency released video footage of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the CBS partner station WAFB, the police secured the glasses at the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was found on the glasses.
After an interview with Simpson, the police claimed that he had confessed to Wayde's deadly shots.
The Advocate reports that the bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coronar's Office published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal police crime lab, the Southern University Police and the local citizens for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional management authority for "their care and their pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of the LSU, Will Wade, said the team was "deeply shocked" and "stood in shock" about Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wade said.
Volcano feeds ashes on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater had increased and within 24 hours 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of grudges and shocks.
Images in social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected increased activity at the volcano 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between the riot police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the riot police, threw eggs at them and also threw paint powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets usually populated with tourists.
In the course of the day, there were also handcuffs with the police, who used their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted 'No forgetting, no forgiveness', while they faced unionists who called 'Long live Spain'.
The local press reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid saw as illegal, but was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
The voters had overwhelmingly opted for independence, although the turnout was low, as the opponents of the secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part with his wife in the separatist protest, said he saw the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulty maintaining the momentum. Many of their best-known leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in prison, waiting for their procedures for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for next year's European Parliament election.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the dismantling of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed by car
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, a crossbow may have been shot at the car.
Menga hit means 1-0 victory over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to a second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved crucial for Gary Holt's team to be able to match Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season without a win away and will face the Hearts next Sunday, which are eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his victory series in the division to six games, meaning head coach Holt has not lost since his takeover of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against boldly playing guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the match, as his directness posed the Rangers with various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the goal. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
This is how the decisive gate came about.
The Rangers allowed for a free kick, and Livingston prepared a chance in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson put Menga in the shooting position, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty room.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but could not overcome the host's defenses, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unchallenged.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend herself.
Scott Pittman was repelled by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow slurred the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Sides repeatedly entered Livingston's penalty room and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required offenses – one by Halkett against the alternate Glenn Middleton and one due to hand play – were denied.
Livingston Phenomenal – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and exceeded the expectations of this upward trend again.
Her way of playing and her team has hardly changed since her return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way in which he has awakened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall continued to trot throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerrard at times, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to penetrate the host team – and that's kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), smiling faces and blue skies prevailed when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then travelled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police cited security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque. However, many supporters were nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also listened. They condemned Erdogan’s policy as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The contrasting protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
In a collision with a car, a cyclist died in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. British summertime near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics took care of the man who died at the scene of the accident.
Months before the accident, another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his nearest relatives.
Road closures and diversions for buses are set up and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officials Hurt in Riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a men's maximum security prison.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still continuing.
Specialised Tornado officials have been involved to end the riots involving eight inmates who are restricted to one wing.
The officials were treated locally for minor injuries to the face.
A Prison Service spokesman said: “It has been used by specially trained prison personnel to resolve an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, police officers were summoned to the prison to deal with serious riots that attacked staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood-like floods (drought areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen early next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert southwest and risk flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about flooding on Mondays and Tuesdays from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and will cross directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix announced in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close to Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation with occasional precipitation up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimetres are likely and occasionally up to 10 centimetres in total.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with Rosa can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, some of these rains are likely to be useful, as drought is currently raging in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category," reports weather.com.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Afterwards, the hurricane will move north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder waters and weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to hit land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
Precipitation can be severe in parts of Mexico, leading to a significant flood risk.
"From Baja California to the north-west of the Sonora Desert, precipitation is expected to be between 7.5 and 15 centimetres, with up to 25 centimetres possible," reports weather.com.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move north across Mexico, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move up through Arizona to the south of Utah until late Tuesday evening.
"The main threat to Rosa or her remains is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-shaped southwest of the USA," informed the National Hurricane Center.
As a result of these rainfalls, landslides are expected in the desert as a result of life-threatening floods and debris drifting in the water, as well as in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After finding a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4:00 a.m. British summer time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
According to the police of Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked all those who had records of what happened on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered "under the vility, anger" of the Democrats.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and outrageous tactics of the Democrats," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "under the tyranny, anger" of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, rejecting the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusation.
The President said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in service to the public," he said to the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican electorate's participation in the mid-elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not kicking, but in reality I'm kicking," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission "to resist and block".
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate on Friday at the latest, said a senior GOP leader to CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, victims increase
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were swept away when gigantic waves hit the beaches due to a severe earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday at a party on the beach of the city of Palu, when at nightfall up to six meters high waves hit the beach, tearing many people to death and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the threat of the tsunami surfaced yesterday, people still went to the beach and did not run away immediately, and they fell victim to it," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency (BNPB) at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it floated cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho. He added that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people had climbed trees on the run from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Civil Protection Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) stated in a statement that the massive earthquake of Friday released energy in response to the 200 times the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown larger, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and stated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the debris of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the damage along the coast could have been 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
According to Nugroho, communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, and there was no information.
According to a declaration by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency was often criticized for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived according to official information at the time of the warning.
Amateur footage published on social media shows a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the street under him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes a water wall crashes on the shore and swam buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The quake and tsunami resulted in a massive power outage that disrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and was reopened only for aid.
A visit by President Joko Widodo to evacuation centers in Palu was planned for Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The World Vision staff from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the workers are housed in tent shelters in the courtyard of their office, but in the words of Canebas they passed by scenes of devastation on the way.
"They said they had seen numerous destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the aid groups began to launch disaster relief with the hard task, some complained that expert foreign helpers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible when the location of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"At the moment, it is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but this status does not apply until now.”
While the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunami sank over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing people hoped for one of the miracles that brightened up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subbandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asia Games that ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, as Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel among the paragliders made the rounds, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, instead of turning to blue checkmarks, only led to grey question marks.
"I think that means that the news was not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal 26,750 US dollars while filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police release on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee of Brink’s filling up an ATM.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to pay more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man came running behind the employee of Brink's" and stole a sack of money intended for the machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the crime scene, but the police did not state how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons with information on the identity of the suspects are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The being officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears on the show as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, cancelled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but, according to West, it has a religious meaning.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said this year in a conversation about his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, became only ‘ye’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album rather reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West used to work, has already written his name with and without hyphens and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of the bloody reprisals against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square and killed 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans with monthly grants for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training led young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
In view of China’s increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research spending in this field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the US government, even though the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much further behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough," Lee said.
The doubling of financial resources could double the chances that the next major AI success would be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranked American Othello player. Later, he was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated former US government technology contests such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the time of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
"It is not China that takes away the top academics, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI.
In Lee's opinion, a changed US immigration policy could also be conducive to US AI efforts.
"I think that people with a doctorate in AI should be offered greencards automatically," he said.
China's State Council presented its next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
According to Lee's words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science are expected to be involved, and the White House also announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month the investment of 2 billion US dollars in the "AI Next" initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, US laws on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change of country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would settle a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's requests for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it claims the Greek territory. Therefore, Greece has vetoed the admission of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name. However, nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign casts doubt that the turnout will reach the 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: 'Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth admitting to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
"I am here to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will vote in the referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia on the change of country name that would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised main, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to much-needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour of this, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
In his words, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would vote in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote 'yes'.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its takeover in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvers through the entire Brighton defense to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton resistance at the Manchester City 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several more defenders at the edge of Brighton's penalty room.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Ryan with his right shoe Brighton goalkeeper Mathew and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We had talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good fun along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few moves to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attack aimed the ball into the net just before it slipped into the net.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim.
Jocker wants to spoil the game for the Rockies
As the Nationals left the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
However, he hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies, who have a lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one Wildcard with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere of the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level I would encounter this year.
Why shouldn't I want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to have jokers thrown in such a situation.
Jocker, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal day of rest on Sunday.
This season, the Washington lawman has a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation in connection with Brett Kavanaugh, whom he had chosen for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the Republican electorate's participation in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones – I'm not kicking in, but I'm actually kicking in, so I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by all means, you see the meanness, the detestableness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The democrats, he said, saw their mission as 'resistance and blocking'.
'And you see that in the last four days,' he said, describing the Democrats as 'angrily and cruel and disgusting and dishonest'.
He named the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud shouts among the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document come out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer accepts all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came as little surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour MEPs to be told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way because she has vigorously opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the censure motion for a different opinion from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that 'the meetings should be inclusive and productive'.
Most of the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were exactly that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'more friendly, gentler' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged by whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader. Colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared similar political views now expected me to turn around and take positions that I would never have agreed with – whether in terms of national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't matter what I say – there's a smear in the social media calling for my election, denouncing the political centre, and saying that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I feel better than some of my colleagues, as the comments addressed to me are mostly of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist abuses every day and yet never give in to it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn demanded last week that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer accept all opinions, and with every motion of censure and every amendment to the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to turn my head and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would 'have no problems'.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, caused by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom literally fell apart in the general school, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most – as a municipal council and as cabinet minister.
I have never made a secret of my political views, not even in the last election.
Nobody in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and about areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday proposal that, given the fact that the country is heading for a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I am not sending this one message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that there are still so many withdrawal threats or political considerations that will not stop me from acting in my best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team climbs to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this highly entertaining game of the day at Tennent's Premiership.
You are now the only of the ten teams unbeaten at the top of the table.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to their superior defenses as well as their better exploitation of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been put to the test in our games so far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have used their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson’s attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been exempted from the Warriors’ game, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot caught a non-increased attempt.
Climo built up the leadership of Ayr with a penalty kick before he scored a hit directly at halftime and then scored an elevated attempt on his own, so that it stood for Ayr at break 17:5.
Melrose, however, started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Afterwards, there was a longer interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the field. After the continuation, Ayr expanded his lead by an attempt by Stafford McDowall raised by Climo.
Then Blair Macpherson, acting as captain of Ayr, received a yellow card, and at the end of a phase of enormous pressure Melrose again had the additional man pay by a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackle without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty lane behind the advancing Ayr package.
Climo has been up since the break after Kyle Rowe had intercepted David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent off flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for a new career in gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems ready for a change to the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was called as managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the leading roles together with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, trapped by land, hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz decorated with dewwork.
A sea-blue flag blows on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Titicacasee to Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our rightful property.
Winning it back is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memory of the 19th-century coastal stretch lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources is still as alive as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice to be delivered on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will follow the ICJ’s judgment on large screens, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand. Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea after decades of sporadic talks.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial fight for his re-election next year, there is also a lot at stake in the verdict on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would change little.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, is not authorised to address Chilean territory and has decided that it will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, the fact that the ICJ's judgment was available six months after the closing statement indicates that the case was "not complicated".
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also be a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has seized upon the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She indicated that Morales' warlike rhetoric has suffocated any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia 'will have an exceptional opportunity to herald a new era of relations with Chile' and an opportunity 'to put an end to the 139-year-long disputes for the benefit of each other', he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never first disarm its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Mr Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to turn the promises made at a summit between the leaders of Singapore’s rivals into action.
His remarks come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to re-launch the deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and US resistance to a declaration to end the Korean war would ever force the North to its knees as "brain-spinning".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to vote in favour of the declaration without Pyongyang taking major disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections of huge headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer have to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed on the catwalk a range of crazy oversized headgear for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their spectacular creations across the catwalk.
The most outstanding piece by Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide edge that almost crushed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple. However, these are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks were covered with sewn-on lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than with Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving gear, including snorkeling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put in another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion watchers predict that the giant headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with a width of 60 centimetres, which from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski all wear.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that blew big waves in the social media sent another great creation over the catwalk: a beach bag made of straw that was almost as big as the model wearing a swimsuit that held the bag.
The bast bag in reddish orange with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I expect large hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has caused so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore."
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to stand out for academic excellence. This continued with further outstanding exam results in 2018 and is only underpinned by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other joint ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest possible level of care for their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as elective subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year's exam show that languages with the highest levels of existence are at the top of the ranking of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students learning foreign languages achieved grade A in the higher exams.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of Mandarin students achieved grade A in the higher exams, while 72 percent of German-learned students obtained grade A in 69 percent of French-learned students and 63 percent of Spanish-learned students also achieved grade A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages are now regarded as elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons given by employers for the problems in filling vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more vacancies require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Irrespective of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people a head start over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken of a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language teaching.
Children who speak several languages, especially those of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese, will teach.
Wherever your child's interests lie, in independent schools a number of languages will always be available with suitably specialised teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future looks like.
At this stage in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, and this must therefore be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James competing for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait will soon come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the preseason.
However, how many minutes he will play is not yet clear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably only play for a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games to prepare at this stage of my career," he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start a series of campaign demonstrations tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five rallies planned for next week, including in his well-meaning places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the pending vote on the confirmation of his election to the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build up support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. (East Coast Time).
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump will probably address the hearings of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on allegations of sexual misconduct that have been conducted in a tense atmosphere this week. The expected Senate vote on confirmation remains suspended for up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to support Republicans who face difficult elections in November.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies next week will serve to "mobilize volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to preserve and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Control of Congress is so important for his plans that the President will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season approaches," said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to name his name to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh media could participate in the rally planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling".
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows willingness to fight to maintain the hope for individuals on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-part games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the momentum is a pure invention as a sport concept, but one in which the players really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were in the lead with six points, and now there are four, so I think that means a little momentum for us," said Jordan Spieth when leaving the venue.
Europe is, of course, an advantage and is four points ahead, while twelve others follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each have three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from tee to green and takes the lead with a good example.
The guttural screams of enthusiasm became louder as he sank an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both after he and Thomas had fallen behind after two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream, which suggests that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really have to kneel down and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
This is all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days and thus undoubtedly wrote the story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" wasn't the only pair that didn't beat Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the rear nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the apparently flowing energy between them and the exuberant crowd underscores that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
To speak of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-man hero of the morning who played with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swedes in a jam that they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of trouble.
The pairs of fours and fours are so fascinating to look at from close up due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don't give, and the way a strategy can change at lightning speed.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day. However, this round of four has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
After the fours and fours on Saturday, Europe is up against the USA with 10:6 and goes with a solid lead into the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari advanced with two victories over the difficult Tiger Woods and was able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to win back the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated in the fours in the morning against the flawed American team and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. won two matches in the four games, but could not make up the gap.
In the 12 singles played on Sunday, Jim Furyk's team needed eight points to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while Molinari and Molinari, who were christened "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, won four points only as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized perfectly and beat the disenchanted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more forceful 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the fours in the morning, returned and played the fours as a partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, not everything went according to their ideas.
Three-time Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup it was only twice that a team came back after it had gone into the singles with a gap of four points. However, as title holder for Furyk's team a draw is enough to keep the trophy.
Since they've only been in second place for two days, it doesn't look like they can launch a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that under these circumstances, the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "essential measures for good will" last year, stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing itself not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the US, there is no trust in our national security, and in these circumstances we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stage-by-stage" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US President-in-Office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim had promised to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is aiming for an official end to the Korean war that took place from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes calls for a relaxation of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on "first denuclearization" and increases the pressure by sanctions to reach its goal through coercion, and is even opposed to the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The assumption that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a fantasy of people who don't know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not discuss plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US head of state had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If South Korea were the other party in the denuclearization issue instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped."
However, the tone of Ris's speech differed enormously from that of his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States after "evil president" Trump Kim called "rocket man" on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened the "full destruction" of North Korea last year, overcrowded Kim at the United Nations with praise for his courage with regard to disarmament steps. However, he said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in force until the denuclearisation of North Korea.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for it: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must definitely continue vigorously until we have achieved full, final and verified denuclearisation."
“The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry out Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, while leaving Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made just to be accused of being "gangster-like" by North Korea hours later.
North Korea vowed this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex when the United States took 'appropriate action'.
He said that Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he wanted were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to sleep enough in one class
A new course at Harvard University will make sure that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture to keep up with caffeine and learn all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unneeded when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the USA.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about it now, in my last year?’
According to her, no one had ever told her how important sleep was. That surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which takes place for the first time this year, explained to the students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the University's health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the image of a room in a dormitory and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They receive information on the effects of caffeine and light as well as on the effects of lack of sleep on the athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged to think about their daily routine using a map of the university grounds with interactive symbols.
"We know that it will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that you have the right to know – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a "night shift" is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
To ensure good sleep enough, the "secret weapon" of all students should be against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, weight gain could be avoided as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course. He took one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study programme before starting their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, students should set an alarm clock for bedtime and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light", which can be caused by electronic screens and LED lighting, and which can get the circadian rhythm off the beat. This leads to problems when falling asleep.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga goal defeats Gerards player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's score for Steven Gerrard's disparately playing team meant a 0-1 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's only second loss in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the Hearts, by far the leading in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-time, and the low-inspiration Rangers seemed to have no chance to balance.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and is only behind Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers are also threatened with further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which Ayr overtook and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players who took a point off the Hearts last week, and should be thrilled how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure at every turn.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after only two minutes, when Menga's first surrender led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal. However, the midfielder missed his chance and missed out.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, he should have been punished, but referee Steven Thomson did not accept the Colombian complaint.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hit in the 34th minute may not match the course of the game, there is no denying that they had earned it for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard traded half-time and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change was almost immediately effective when the winger Morelos put in position, but the impressive Kelly raced off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to make the score to play exactly the game that lies to them, with Lithgow and Halkett getting one long ball at a time.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor stood up well and resisted Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also late demanded a penalty kick after a match with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "In fact, I hear a crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name, however, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" degenerate cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy degenerate cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise degenerate cells.
The method removes immune cells from a patient that are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a lot of cancers common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect degenerate cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2 that is common to many cancers. Subsequently, the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method, in which patients are removed from immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells, has helped in the treatment of a leukaemia type.
Kanye West released a Pro-Trump-Tirade after his appearance at SNL, wearing a MAGA-cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed out at Saturday Night Live in the studio after widely praising US President Donald Trump and saying he wants to run as presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he continued with a canonade against the Democrats and once again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's reviled record was not broadcast, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West with the release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had difficulties backstage because of his headgear.
“They harassed me backstage.
You said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap’.
You bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken realm?" He said he would "dress my superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want it to go on with the world?
Try it with love."
His remarks triggered at least twice calls from the audience, and SNL contributors seemed embarrassed, reported Variety. One person said to the magazine, "It became silent in the studio."
West had been signed late as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many with a lecture entitled "I Love it", in which he was disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU THAT THE MASS IS DETERMINED."
The talk show presenter Karen Hunter tweeted, however, that West is simply himself and that is absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, adopts an ideology that is harmful to my community and gives of itself (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The Being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name into a symbol and then into "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" (The artist formerly known as Prince).

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington attacks toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword-wielding Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such roles on the screen would result in boys often having the feeling of having to be strong in order to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture," Harington said that he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also a member of "Game of Thrones", also 31, admitted that solving the problem was "very important" to him.
"I personally think the question of what went wrong with masculinity is very important at the moment," he said.
"What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now seeing?"
Harington believes that, due to the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives boys the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
Because something has clearly gone wrong with the young men."
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones". He had "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November Harington will be on show in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best thing about "Game of Thrones" was that he had met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so this is how I got my future family and life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
They married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14°% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In contrast to the past, the vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was almost zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 year-on-year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Based on the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has, among other things, promised universal access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked GOP senators' data, criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied claims that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the MPs' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that the claims of "ultra-right-wing" experts and websites were being disseminated.
"Lie, lie and even more hideous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. It was published during the hearing of a Senate committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct committed against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the contributions was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ explanation quickly sparked criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a congressman.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You mustn't be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous for all members of my staff."
Criticism of "Johnny English – One lives only three times" – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-colored new film. This also seems to be true for this revival of the action comedy franchise "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spy Who Sifted It" and resurrected in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now All Right" stuttering.
Will an ironic self-parody on how obviously stupid we are become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the stark-eyed, grimace-cutting and incompetent Johnny English has been extended for the second time for screwing up. His name signals more than anything else that he is a general comical creation for cinema visitors in the non-English-speaking area.
Of course, he's the crazy secret agent again, who bizarrely thinks he's cool and worldly, while in reality he's made up of something Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a crack of this guy, who contributed a single note to the title melody of "The Hour of the Winner" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos behind travellers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the meanwhile forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades were hanging on his helmet for a short while.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to light, but humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-assured comedy elements.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than at adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy mishaps are not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gag in the role of Bean.
The eternally current premise is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British espionage network and exposed the identities of all British agents in action, much to the displeasure of the on-duty agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and distressed figure who is already facing complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script doesn't give much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been exposed and that she has to take someone out of retirement.
This includes the clumsy Johnny English himself, who is now working as a teacher at a chic institution, but who gives unofficial lessons in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers an espionage academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former heavily tested Kumpan Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman of higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always do everything terribly wrong in Her Majesty's secret service, are back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque jokes: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a chic French restaurant, they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house using a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as they are, the subject is already discussed in detail on children's television.
Pretty moderate stuff.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself: "Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?"
Labour denies to work on a plan that will allow the British to work four days a week but will be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants corporate leaders to pass on to workers the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional day off.
This would give employees a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea "fits" the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source said to the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected before the end of the year.
"A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration consistent with the Party's approach to restoring economic balance for workers and with the Party's general industrial policy strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. Already the Green Party promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the overall approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of 'anonymous directors' and 'profit makers' in public utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not get their entire share back, as a Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the board of directors of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds to hand over 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who collect annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in the news magazine "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority could influence Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light, which could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“At the trial, I announced that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
"My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and there should be a bomb bursting," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett vehemently denied this," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all who called her could not confirm it."
It's been 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has this festival helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place for the 7th time this year, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group is trying to combat poverty by encouraging more and more people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks, including volunteering, communication with a leader in the world (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal of combating poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen remains 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of offering a cool free concert a reasonable way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announced that since 2011 the project has recorded more than 19 million actions from its supporters and achieved various goals.
These actions are said to have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least 10 billion US dollars have already been paid out or raised by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the secured funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who promised to help Rwanda with $35 million to combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions calling on Britain to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They replied: “It will be a long and exhausting way with ups and downs.
But similar to the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who perform at this year’s event in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also presenters.
The US could use the Navy to block Russian energy exports – Ministry of Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can rely on the Navy if necessary to prevent Russia's energy from reaching markets including the Middle East, said US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently active in these areas at the invitation of the legitimate government.
"I think the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new markets in the energy sector, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to do this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the seaways remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that Russia's energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the participants in the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as the "voice of electricity consumers" in the US.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they were practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, calling Russia a "one trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when Trump’s government was expanding the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, the government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin, became the "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth USD 11 billion, is an exclusively economic project, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received headwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," says BDI board member Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "examine" a 2020 presidential candidate, says Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "examine" a presidential candidate after the mid-elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to 'examine' a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is steering this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
Warren has not spoken out in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is required before the vote.
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that they should run for 2020.
According to the survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be able to stand.
32 percent of voters supported such candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed.
Other names of prominent Democrats eligible for a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin comments on the post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by track Palin at Donald Trump-Ralley
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, all of this can be felt by other families who feel the effects of the PTSD and part of the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an "elefant in the room" and said about her son and other war veterans that they are coming back changed, that they are coming back more fervently, that they are coming back and wondering if there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military have given the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support an appeal for a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support an appeal to the new US policy that refuses asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a court expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who is questioning politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace-against-sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused her, but that U.S. officials refused to apply for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, nations that are facing major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy repealed a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, state and international legislation."
"The Federal Act requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle", was stated in the court expert statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policies that deny immigrants access to the country have an adverse impact on the US economy, as immigrants could be more likely to act as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour.
In June, Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
"Asylum exists for all those who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or for fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," said Sessions in his policy announcement of 11 June.
It has never been the plan to defuse all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of fatalities doubles in the race over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It's all very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming down her little feverish son in a rescue centre in the destroyed city centre of Palu.
“Every minute comes a new ambulance with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to collect their soaked possessions and collect everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of hospitals damaged by the 7.5 - magnitude earthquake were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated in the outdoor area due to the persistent aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went far too fast.
I think I was trapped under the collapsed walls," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in town was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cries for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place."
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were announced, the US ambassador in China accused the state capital Beijing of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
U.S. Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, an indictment that denies China.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the US elections are in line with the announcement by US officials to Reuters, a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a rampant trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-time Governor of Iowa, who exports large quantities of agricultural products to China, reported that Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in Des Moine's Sunday register, is now doubling this tyranny by placing propaganda ads in its own free press in the US.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the American tradition of freedom of expression and the independent press by switching paid advertising into the Des Moines register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find limited opposition to the newsstand here in Beijing and no real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have about China's disturbing economic development, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans exaggerate female voters against the midterm elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the forthcoming mid-elections, which could be based in particular on women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already reported that they are continuing with a vote.
"You can't undo these things," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last minute move (R-Arizona) was sufficient for an FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow, and they don't forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the Senate hallway called "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold on to the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford’s public statement, detailing their allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could result if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a mess for the GOP," said early last week Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the panel, the final vote or the review of Kavanaugh; it's also about the way the Republicans dealt with it and how they dealt with it," Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, told the news channel to a group that supports the election of Democrats.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree as to who to believe on the basis of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% said that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied about his testimony, while 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an affidavit in front of the Senate Justice Committee last week that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during their studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee suggested that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We need to take action now," he said on the subject of startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so users can create their own personal online storage or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the private and business sectors.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in a browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user alone can decide who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal reinforcement and development of data.
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not exchange views with Facebook and Google on whether to make a comprehensive change that will completely transform their entire business models overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt-Col and priest Bernard Vann won the award for his engagement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the feat for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918, through thick fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he penetrated to the fireline and with the "greatest bravery" led the line forward, before hurried ahead with a single field weapon and shut down three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time something that would make you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero was first and foremost visible through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there were Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed up all night watching an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The bill of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the audience in the United Kingdom was not surprised when suddenly Peppa Pig was on display.
Some remained untouched after they stayed awake until the early hours of the morning to see the fight in particular.
A fan on Twitter described the change to the cartoon character as a kind of bad joke.
"Due to a regulation by the government, this content is not classified as child-free, so it had to be changed to a children's show at 6 a.m.," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in Marketing and Communications at Bellator, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The CEO of Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will work on the schedule to take into account UK viewers in the future.
"I think the problem could be solved in the repeat game," he said.
“But it’s 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday with the audience in the UK, and we’re not going to solve the incident until Sunday our time there, Monday local time.
But we'll hold on.
There was a lot of communication during the change. It was really messed up and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical malfunction.
What was not the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we've been trying to give the fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is quite unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "below" on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who was a water jumper at various Olympic games, says that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at secondary school that he was different from others.
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victories at the Olympic Games are no longer so important to him.
The actual presenter of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses for a few months due to illness.
In the first show of Laverne, he said that he used to consider himself inferior compared to others, as the love for boys and girls was socially totally unacceptable.
He said: "Until now, feeling inferior to others and different from others is reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to not disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is now a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he spoke on this issue because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The triple world champion fell in love with the US film maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference had never been a topic.
He says that if you had to go through so much as a child and a teenager – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley believes that his entire point of view has changed since then.
Last year, he would have turned everything around gold medals.
But for him there are now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his jackpot.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father didn't accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked about was the tickets for London in 2012, as he wanted to be in the front line.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after that that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he continued.
Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
"All I knew was that it was always my dream to dive in front of a local audience at the Olympic Games – that was amazing," he said.
His first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by it. He heard the song in the run-up to the Olympic Games and still caused goosebumps.

Mickelson, who is not in shape at the moment, is sitting on the replacement bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record in his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make a lot of effort so that the whole thing doesn't turn into a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bench on Saturday by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes.
Instead of being the center of the action as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering on others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus not an ideal cast for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself wasn't discouraging enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, newcomer to these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans hit a hot start with four points behind in the 12 individual games, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to that.
"He was fully aware of his role today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is one of the world's best known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week as well.
I didn't think he'd be there for two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it went and that's what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most of the Ryder Cup games held on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully matched the high points of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, had to take 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
"He is funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he is a great person who is popular with the whole team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little more this week. It was fun to watch them.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows it can be over soon with the lead
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead leading into the last singles games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans, but only barely crossed the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, winning a win of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
"The idea remains that we had a big head start in Valderrama, we had a big head start in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only a short one," said Bjørn (pictured in the photo) after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5–3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all team members that it's not over.
It's really starting tomorrow.
Get in your head and do the right thing.
The whole thing won't be over until the scoreboard points.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus lies.
I've always said it, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are fully aware of what is facing us on the other side: the best players in the world."
“ I would never rush it, ” Bjorn continued, rejoicing at the performance of his players on a difficult golf course.
Tomorrow will be a different caliber.
Tomorrow, individual achievements will be in the foreground and that is a completely different matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're being tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make that clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players score better individually than on the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those big turns on the last tournament day. He stood in Brookline on the winning side before he stood on the side of the losers after Europe's "miracles of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he replied to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
If momentum strikes in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out the way we feel, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of making a counter strike, he has to compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
"I chose the boys in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said about his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War period. However, according to local media, it will not be delivered until at least next year due to faulty systems and rapidly increasing costs.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that referred to a military spokesman.
The ship should have been put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are intended to replace the old frigates of the Bremen-Class.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and marine target missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature are longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays can lead to the fact that the state-of-the-art warships, which are supposed to represent Germany as a naval power, will already be obsolete at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
Last year, Fregatte F125, persecuted by the accident, hit the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware errors" that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a battle situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is far too heavy, which leads to performance losses and prevents the Navy from carrying out upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class, which were used by Germany during the Second World War.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, also became a problem.
Apparently, the cost rose to a staggering €3.1 billion compared to the €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Commissioner for Defence of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the navy "is running out of ships capable of operating".
Bartels said that the problem increased over time as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken by the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will trace dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown long ear and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and which species does what.
A map and a report of the habitat will then be created to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for the bats and how these are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and to show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to the loss of living space.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the topic of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who carry out regular examinations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Threeve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Governor David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
"Here in Threeve we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there are many things we don't yet know about bats, so here and in other goods, we do these works that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He stressed the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it was possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many of our species do not know what their populations are like."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape charges against him "fake news" and said that people want to be "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker from the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel on Friday, he allegedly paid her 375,000 dollars to buy her silence on the incident.
In an Instagram live video about his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news" only hours after their release.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or to the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror on the grounds of the accusations they described as "inadmissible reporting on suspicions in the field of privacy" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded compensation for "moral damages at an amount equal to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where, according to records filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was killed by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that she is now trying to cancel the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer he switched to the Italian giant Juve in a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: The UK would ‘ever regret’ the loss of car manufacturers
The UK would "repent forever" if it lost its status as a leading global car manufacturer after Brexit, said Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He continued that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain left the EU.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of border delays on a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis product lines, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will see production stops at our plant at the end of March at an uncontrolled Brexit," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard exit from the EU without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain during a tough Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
Should the UK leave the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be disruptions at the borders, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock at the Derbyshire plant that would last longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa May's Chequers Plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that will enable us, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's broadcast Today.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite union, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "for another week", while the dispute over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has reviewed the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who examines the election interference by Russia, the links between Trump's advisors and Russia, and the President's possible obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumours in Washington for the past month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was addressing the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump and dismissing the President with the help of the 25th amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, as new reports of his supposed resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time, was announced for next Thursday,
Trump said he would prefer not to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid it colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for it. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed for another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
That will prove to be the case, but I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences did not resent the TV reporters' "effekthascherei" but admitted: "I would not deny that they are doing effecthascherei."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President is doing more question-and-answer rounds before him than any president," she said, without providing any precise evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Press conferences will still be held, says Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better to talk to me than to do so.
We try to do this a lot, and you have seen that we have done it a lot in the last few weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this was the case when he made an out of hand and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of a group of reporters.
Minister of Health writes about the Brexit concerns of EU employees of the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health is addressing people from abroad who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and the desire to remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland's decentralised public service.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the UK-EU exit negotiations continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the troubling times these must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, after a head injury that he incurred on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," says Reed.
Trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher and transported away for further examinations.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details on the type or extent of the injury are known yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called red shirt, plays for Tennessee State in his first season after moving over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total to 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for buying real estate in the UK
Foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp tax in the future to buy property in the United Kingdom. According to the new Conservative Party plans, the additional income will benefit homeless people
This step is intended to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp duty will apply to all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance anticipates an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy property in the United Kingdom, with the additional income to the benefit of homeless people.
This step is an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn's success among young voters, promising to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp duty is levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and the additional income is to be added to the government's campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is levied in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago to second homes and residential properties left for rent, could be up to three percent.
The Finance Ministry expects the move to generate more revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK investors, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become 'spirit cities' due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a reduction in the stamp tax in order to allow more young people the first home of their own.
He accused construction companies of holding up real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's "dwelling".
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a spectacular series of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a fixed rental price to a ban on eviction for no good reason.
He also wants to give city councillors more powers in the construction of new dwellings.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving life from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live and work here and build a life.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of homeowners has become too far away for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness remains too big a problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says that it is his ‘biggest goal’ to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge to breathe new life into the club from the north-east of England, which is currently in third place in League One and is missing three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that’s it," Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But when I was a kid, I often saw Scotland playing in Hampden with my father, and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in club management."
Ross' predecessor in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic claimed not to be afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, my success will be measured by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he explained.
"It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only consider my time here to be a success if I bring the club back there."
Ross has a three-year management career, after a phase as deputy boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month career as coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the delegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the margin of the delegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"This was probably a real crossroads," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, even more than playing.
It sounds funny, because I did not do badly, could live well from it and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still doing this in terms of stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I do it. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin in my whole adult life."
You can listen to the whole interview on Sunday 30 September between 12:00 and 13:00 BST at Sportsound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturdays at 17:30, according to a study
The summer heat wave has given Britain’s crisis-stricken pubs a boost, while restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 percent in July, but revenues at restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the management consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, explained: “Persistent sunshine and England’s continued participation in the World Cup for longer than expected meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, in which pubs were able to record sales increases of 2.8 percent. However, restaurant hit it even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinks showed by far the best performance, with an area-adjusted sales development that increased higher than it fell at restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant owners.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Drink sales in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent a month, while food sales declined by three percent."
RSM analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but revenue losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies with a focus on food and it remains to be seen whether the more temperate temperatures in August will provide the much needed respite."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide it from their parents
One study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 pupils in secondary schools has seen an increase in so-called 'fake insta' pages
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a 'main account' to show to their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that it can keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 pupils in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "fake insta" accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news is fueling fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean 'main account' that they could show to their parents, but they also had private accounts.
One mother, who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who called on others to "rape me."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11-18 year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are being tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes "Voice of the Athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council at its annual General Assembly as a non-executive member.
Doyle is Scotland's most prominent athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their far-reaching international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election to the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance of 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, owns four Olympic gold medals and now frequently appears as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a transitory circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell me if or how far I will recover.
It was hard work, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps comparing mothers to cows causes excitement on the net
A manufacturer of milk pumps caused excitement on the net with an advertising clip comparing nursing mothers with milking cows.
To mark the launch of Elvie's first low-noise portable milk pump, the manufacturer of consumer technology published a music video that was not meant to be very serious in order to emphasise the freedom that the pump gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lines like: "Yes, I milk, but you don't see a cock in me" or "if you haven't noticed, they're not udders but my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, advertising published on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the web.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video came across mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say that it minimized the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Just as we do, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their young will be taken from them within a few days of birth," said one comment.
The Elvie milk pump fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Imaginably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: "Such a non-realistic advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement and a woman admitted that she found the song "uncomic".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breast-feeding.
When I was pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: "This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or in toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that all danced in their bras with the discrete pumps.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who use milk pumps claim to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a daring and provocative market launch.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the associated challenges, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and comprehensible way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump allows.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has hit the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski had a double mother on the catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children interned is higher than ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, as intensified rhetoric and measures by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to accommodate children in caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves have been illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become targets for expulsion when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would have to fingerprint and share this data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior customs officer at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to care for unaccompanied minors.
The authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous records in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either a caretaker or a member of a caretaker’s household are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of them are delinquent foreigners.
That's why we will continue to persecute these people," Albence explained.
In order to be able to handle the cases of the children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules, which according to the staff of the accommodations in some children requires to appear in court within one month instead of 60 days after the detention, which was the standard before.
Many will appear by video and not in person to stand in front of an immigration judge for their legal status.
In case of negative decisions, the person is deported quickly.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to the accommodation staff, as well as reports that have become known from the system in the past month, that they are being frightened and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced with a larger facility like Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems, due to the size are more easily overlooked.
They also explained that traumas that many of the children are already suffering can be exacerbated if they are taken to a tent town without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish “occupational troops” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism and were "treated accordingly".
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more people have been expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus 'will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories have been cleansed' by both terrorist groups and 'any illegal foreign presence'.
The United States has stationed about 2000 soldiers in Syria, training and advising mainly Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are hired against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were met and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prevent refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make it possible to return home," he said.
"They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid would be granted to Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib provided the opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive of the Syrian armed forces supported by Russia to the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action would be taken against jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, who would be "extinguished".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee and stated that its work should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Reelection
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers probably hope, an impeachment or a scandal ended his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time'.
So far, there's no sign that the audience is fed up.
Since 2014, CNN has more than doubled its ratings at the best broadcast time to 1.05 million and almost tripled its ratings at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at the best time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the ratings with a total of 3.5 million viewers on important news evenings.
"It's like a fire that magically attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series "Designated Survivor" on ABC, about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh’, Scovell told me.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike everything on television, the stories from Washington can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible reunification of families and the health of the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you become aware that you have already watched six hours of a round of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000-dollar ostrich leather bomber jacket (according to Washington Post, a "clothing piece rich in self-evaluation") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's teary description of Trump's, um, anatomy.
I for my part will never be able to see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"A part of what he does makes it feel like a reality show that he presents to you every night," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "The Three of the Pawnhouse", about Trump's rotating cast and daily action (a fight with the football league NFL to break off the fence, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you won't come back.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crept inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn't get away from the screen, not when judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was on the verge of testifying to the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Donations flood the narrowest races for seats in Congress during the midterm elections
It is not surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the electoral districts, which led to two incumbents in the race for the same seat.
The recently re-signed suburban district in Pittsburg is launching Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The cards were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the Constitution and were manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of campaign funding between the parties' major financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th constituency of the state.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump gained a 20-point lead there.
Political experts give the Democrats easy leadership.
The U.S. tested El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then turned back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partner threw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
US State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all American representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesman for the ministry in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador was consideration given to criminal measures, which in 2017 received an estimated 140 million dollars in American aid, including for drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting the previous year and represented a step forward in efforts to discourage migrants from moving towards the US.
In mid-September, however, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October to signal the importance of the government to the Assembly, according to diplomats.
The three American diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new harsh communications or sanctions from Washington.
A John Bolton government spokesman refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed on the condition of anonymity to comment on the internal discussions.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learning from History
The next big surprise could be the report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible judicial obstruction, for which there is now sufficient evidence in public.
Mueller is now also allegedly investigating whether Trump's campaign team with Russia conspired to attack the American elections.
If the Congressional majority were to change, Trump would be confronted with an organ that would force him to account, precisely at the very time when he passed by to step back before the voters; and possibly before a jury of jurors.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we need to make decisions that will influence how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein got into devil's kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he proposed to secretly record the president and speculated about whether he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and misstatement in office?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress that will make Trump accountable in the mid-elections?
If we fail in these trials, we will have a long winter ahead.
But I don't think we're gonna fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?"

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistically ahead of the match against Vienna
The Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans was unable to make his appearance until the 2-2 match against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
"This was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good," says the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we could make something out of it and we went home with one point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked hard in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this is going to be a tough game because they scored a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we can do this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look ahead, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of pension provision leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although participants in the survey knew exactly how to take care of them, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in Nationwide's study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide's Life Insurance Division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor on board: your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Dispose of legal disputes at the last minute.
Set up a pension authority so that you can hire a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals will meet your needs if you are unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It is not only the financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the drug treatment?"
Who's taking care of the dog?

Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with air rifle
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after working with friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials described the shootings that took place at about 02:30 British time as an 'arbitrary act'.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police were looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. The number of deaths is likely to increase.
Due to the failure of communication systems, auxiliary personnel were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island for a coastal stretch of over 300 km (180 miles).
In 2017, an estimated 299,200 people lived in the administrative district, one administrative unit below the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Civil Protection Agency, Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies on the Seismic Pacific Fire Ring, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya district in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, which is popular among tourists, and claimed more than 500 deaths, especially on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and former vice president candidate, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and resistance to state violence, according to a report published by Alaskan police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up a friend's phone when she wanted to call the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 security deposit has been collected.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when he was asked about his plea, he replied with "Not guilty, quite certain," according to the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three class A offences, which can be punished with up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B irregularity, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been tried.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated in front of the Alaska Veteran’s Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of slapping her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she traced her son's behavior back to a post-traumatic stress disorder following his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake of 7.5 caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the moment the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor calls for rare death penalty for suspects in New York terrorist attack
The New York Attorney's Office is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the terrorist attack in New York City, which cost eight lives. This is a rare sentence that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
Thirty-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up from the Home Depot hardware store to carry out a terrorist attack, driving on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight ofer "targeted" and inflicted "consciously" severe bodily injuries, according to the statement of intent for the death penalty claim filed in the southern district of New York.
According to the court record, both charges could be punished with death.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Court of Investigation of Saipov presented a 22-point indictment, which includes eight charges of murder against the background of organised crime, which are normally used by federal lawyers in cases of organised crime, as well as an indictment of the violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack called for "fundamental planning and intent", according to the prosecutors, who described the way in which Saipov carried out the act as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted damage, pain and losses on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement explained.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal offense was committed in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple guilty of conspiracy to espionage the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, witnessed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court records.
He told investigators to feel good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also demanded that the flag of ISIS be hung in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were "of course disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty will only prolong the trauma suffered by all parties, rather than accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life-long prison sentence without the possibility of dismissal," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest action in the context of the Tories Conference.
Ukip's former party leader said that politicians "must feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, while a Theresa Mays party MP suggested that Farage lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would be "already out" if Farage were Brexit ministers.
The challenge facing May in reconciling her deeply disputed part was exacerbated by the fact that members of your party who are in favour of staying in the EU participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping her Chequer compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, she should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
Bone explained at the 'Leave Means Leave' demonstration in Solihull that 'Chequers belong to the garbage'.
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were responsible, we would be out there already,' he explained.
The Wellingborough MP added: ‘I will stand up for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.’
Stressing his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the referendum in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people had changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unpopular in public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who actually go through the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Minister will keep their jobs if you keep their promises.’
In a speech, Farage said that politicians must ‘felt the pressure’ if they are in the process of deceiving the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,’ says Farage.
‘They’re trying to cheat Brexit, and that’s why we’re here today to tell them: ‘You won’t get away with it’.
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
‘We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, which has helped us to win the referendum and will never come to rest, as long as we are not an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.’
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners from the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party that was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security issues with a party app when the conference was opened.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, just like all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ said Adonis.
‘This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine’ presidential candidate
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would "examine the presidential nomination."
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about their future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election for the Senate against the Republican MP in the Massachusetts Parliament Geoff Diehl, who was vice-chairman of Trump's election campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the center of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been its 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for women "to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top."
Arrest after death shots on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of the fatal shots fired at LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man to be seen on the shots.
20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury on his head and died as a result of this injury," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, according to the sports media portal 247sports.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the crime scene and possession of a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after his team has given him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes's stable order would play a major role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas made a good start and it was almost as if he was leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the pits and let Hamilton hit the traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits one lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-to-wheel maneuver, in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside, with the risk of enduring two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in one of the back places of the field and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for most of the race as he held on to his tire to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the box in the 44th round and did not manage to take a step in the remaining eight laps, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me pass.
The team has done an excellent job to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A Case of Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election campaign on Saturday, insisting that she did not pass on to the press the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not address his statement directly to the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are "common, malicious and dishonest."
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and malicious and dishonest," the President said.
“When you look at the leaks and say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Published the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment, please.
Did we... no, we didn't publish it," he added by mimicking the senator's voice.
Feinstein was added to the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and it was published at the beginning of September. However, Feinstein denied that the Leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for secrecy."
Your denial didn’t seem to be well received by the president, who said at the campaign on Saturday night: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defense of the judge's candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the Democrats claimed that the accusations would be used for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You can see the meanness, the malice, they don't care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to get power and control," said the president, according to the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for the defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday with a 5-3 victory in the return match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early with two goals, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made up for the home team before Dwyer re-established the Giants.
Francois Bouchard balanced out for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for Adam Keefe's men who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the previous three games.
Dwyer’s opening gate took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a submission by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford provided the template when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie to his goal after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the lead of the Giants before the half-time break when he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced again with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half. Nielsen then secured his team victory with a fifth goal after just under half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home at Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Air traffic controllers died after making sure hundreds of people on an airplane escaped the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake that caused a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks can still be felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was collapsing.
Agung died later in the hospital.
According to Australia's ABC News, Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this news," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could increase to several thousand. The country's civil protection authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to increase, as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Department.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you to work all day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, killing over 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports a missing person after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight that plunged into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports a missing person after claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that they cannot say anything about the whereabouts of a passenger by Saturday afternoon.
The airline stated to work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water when trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, but were in a stable state.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both declared that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was flying over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others could wade through deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors who were working nearby to improve a dock were rushing to the rescue with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people were killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed her case on Saturday in the retrial of a case in which a man is accused of having banished a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their night of death using cell phone calls.
Rowlett said to have received position data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford entered the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been to the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
But cell phone records pointed out that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that, some time after Chamberer's death, Tellis released their messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone.
"He cut them off from his life," says Hale.
The defense is expected to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then be brought before the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that Hip Hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social commitment.
They want to go back to his roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York nanny suing couple for dismissal after "racist" SMS
A New York nanny sued a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from the mother complaining that she was "still a black".
The couple denied being racist and compared the dispute with "extortion".
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new day-mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEINE, BUT A WAR", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice. Twice.
After recognizing her faux pas, Plasco-Flaxman released Maurice and claimed that the open-minded African-American day-mother had done a bad job and that she had expected a Philippine woman instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims a claim for compensation for the $350 a day, which she would have spent over six months, the job for which she had originally been booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," she told the newspaper on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the racism accusations, arguing that the dismissal was the reasonable step, fearing Maurice, after insulting them, that they could no longer trust.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," explained husband Joel Plasco to the post office.
“But would you entrust your children to a person to whom they were rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case to "extortion" and stated that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“You want to charge such a person?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
As the lawsuit continues, the couple was quickly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it's very funny with today's knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had had no problem with it, his work would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of his release after his death last year was "bittersweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, which she describes as a "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and did not brag," said Jankel.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who does something special: you are proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself the responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looked really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance," says Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, telling me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart on the pump slowly resounded and left her body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the moment when everything went down.
There was nothing I could do but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane along with the other passengers who didn't know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women hang cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up maps on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for counseling.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she explained.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and that he had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room."
However, he quit his job before his death because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide by his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: "I am always afraid that this could have a follow-up effect."
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been with for 15 years, shortly after his mother had died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at a low point. When the children unpacked their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a major trauma to her, but that she had to go through it: “It is tearing a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in suspension while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could actually get something like this, that is, a limited time and scope investigation, we might be able to get a little concord," Flake said on Saturday. He fears that the committee will "break apart" in the party political stalemate.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance can be traced back to the timing alone.
The mid-elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans did not perform well as expected, they would be considerably weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush at the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, in which there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice President, to decide on a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors sinking under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, based on data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, said that 1127 defectors were registered last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park cited stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices of human smugglers as the main factors.
Pyongyang did not speak publicly about this.
The vast majority of defectors from the north are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China views the defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often uses violence to bring them back.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations.
This was due to the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, at which they generally agreed to work towards a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust the US, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally at first," said Mir Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not fit for the post at the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t resist the impression that a woman who acted like this would have been called ‘hysterical’,” said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
In an emotional way, Kavanaugh denied all accusations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost screamed and was about to burst into tears when he talked about his family and his high school days.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputational murder" organized by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was biased towards Democrats.
"I believe that with these statements and the way in which he drew on the Clintons and the Democrats, he himself has declared himself unfit," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if he were confirmed and the Democrats were to win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say so much: if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judgeship," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington D.C.
Pelosi further said that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade abortion principle decision, as he is regarded as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, biased person to go to this court and expect us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful’,” said Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She went on to say: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she would also cry when she became angry but developed a technique. If she became angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to: “You may think that I am sad because I am crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought that was awesome."
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I cried because of an indescribable anger, and was grabbed by the collar by an older woman, an undercool manager, whom I was always a little afraid of, and pulled into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re pissed off.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with yourself, because they believe that you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado congressman, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy.
"That was not a well thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation: ‘Snowlights and the Seven Dwarves’.
As the election campaign had already progressed, she was down on fundraising, and she vowed not to run if she wasn't going to get $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who donated $1,000 to men only supported their campaign with $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she asked herself.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made fundraising and direct addressing of voters instead of delegates so difficult, as well as the anger about sexism that she was close to tears.
"It could have been assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“It could have been believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She cried"?"
Why Beijing Could Benefit from US-China Trade War
The opening bellows of the US-China trade war were deafening. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a gap between countries in the long run, my experts.
Donald Trump, the American president, fired the first warning earlier this year when he imposed punitive tariffs on important Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new punitive tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, effectively affecting half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing struck back in the same way each time and recently imposed fines of five to ten percent on US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China swore to answer every measure taken by the US, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon stumble.
To get Washington to give in would mean giving in. However, a public wrinkle against the US would be far too shameful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized," says Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, said the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer," he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomed aid to rebuild the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won back the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the US.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with much of the tournament, sank his tee on the 16th course (par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win the trophy back.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have made a contribution," said emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot John Rahm, who won 2-1 in the individual encounters against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday.
I am so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I have been watching on TV since my childhood," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had problems finding the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have done high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the boys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put pressure on Europe.
We didn't make anything of it.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players performed well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're going to look ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull your hat.
We were defeated."
