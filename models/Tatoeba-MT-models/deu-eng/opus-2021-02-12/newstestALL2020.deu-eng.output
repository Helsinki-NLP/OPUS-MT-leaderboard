Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in Rouen, France, considered to be particularly dangerous, was extinguished, and the prefecture of Normandy reported on Friday. The fire broke out at night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with around 200 fire extinguishers.
The fire could be stopped
Buildings within a radius of 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. Additives for lubricants are produced at the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine. The factory is part of the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work at the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas escaped methane thiol through a leak and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the waste water system of the city after an industrial accident.
Woman quits her job to look for 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and for that she quit her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days was missing every trace of the bitch - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they were going to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had panicked dog
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the front desk. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But days have been weeks. "I have never given up. I have never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake" who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a phone call: A man called and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered, according to "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her."
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27th, 2019
Six machine guns of the type MG3 have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear, and the opposition speaks of a "fearing" scale.
With the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is evident from a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which is reported by the editorial network Germany.
According to the paper from the office of Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one part of the gun and 3474 rounds of ammunition have reappeared so far. The still missing weapons and parts of the weapons include six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven guns of the type G3, four guns of the type G36, six signal guns as well as two pistols of the type P8. In addition, 30 gun pipes for machine guns of the type MG3 are missing.
The amount of gun and munitions losses in the Bundeswehr is "awesome," said left-wing member of the Bundestag Martina Renner. This is all the more true as little has been found in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance sheet". Renner criticized that the listing did not show whether the missing munitions were also the ones found in connection with the investigations against the suspected Bundeswehr officer Franco A.. "Even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for the possession of these munitions," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas this Friday. Ship observation data from Refinitiv showed that the tanker was moving and leaving the Iranian port. Port Rashid was declared as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but at first it remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was raised on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on the charge of violating security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belongs to Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region had increased immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel Appreciates the Courage of People in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor reminded, among other things, of the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "State security was taken away from terror," she said.
Musk Aspires to Delivery Record
Tesla's quarter may have a record. Despite the delivery boom, the electric car company has recently suffered losses.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, Musk's circular continued. The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly. To do so, Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of over six percent. Price hasn’t increased that much in almost four months. Tesla delivered a good 95000 cars in the second quarter, thus reaching its previous best.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. Six-digit figures are required for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
Mystery Solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found out this with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress was also made on the question why children resist tickling so violently, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the approaching of a tickling hand triggers laughter before the touch. This lies on a deep layer in the cerebrum, which triggers laughter already with the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats react with "Laughter" in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans. This "Laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-touching
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and contact by others - that is, people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers found out in the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the respective area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-contact. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves. During the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh have been intensified.
But if the self-contact and the contact by others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between the self-contact and the contact by others. The new findings suggest that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-contact activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they sometimes broke off this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showed flight behaviour or fright. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Large fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in Rouen, France, considered to be particularly dangerous, was extinguished, and the prefecture of Normandy informed AFP on Friday that the fire had broken out on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no harmful substances are said to have leaked. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticizes his own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session in Parliament following the lifting of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement if Brussels does not agree to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, it is unclear how he intends to achieve this.
About Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and reunite this country would be to complete the exit of the EU." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya Attacks Revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They remind of the roses that thousands of people had left in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Among others Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to open.
On 22 July 2011, law-terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first set off a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then shot dozens of participants in a summer camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers’ Party on the island of Utöya. 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran frees British tankers
The UN General Debate did not solve the Iran conflict, but now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to sink back into the sea. It could be a piece of the puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been detained in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, according to the shipping company Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, explained shipping company head Erik Hånell. At noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told the Swedish TV channel SVT.
The Foreign Ministry in London described the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on July 19 on the charge that they had disregarded the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in view of the difficult and exhausting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar at the beginning of July when a supertanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been destined for Syria, was put on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the US.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. London vehemently rejected the idea that it was a trade in order to free the "Stena Impero".
The Strait of Hormus is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region had increased immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The US had left the international nuclear agreement in 2018 alone, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a more stringent and extended agreement to other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign security forces, wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf with the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf.
With its protectionist economic policy, India is building a better future.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war winner." Given the punitive tariffs imposed on Chinese producers by America’s President Donald Trump, foreign producers in the People’s Republic are forced to re-dispose. Financial leaders of Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country call India one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. Of course, this has not only to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more significant role to play in the world’s far-reaching production chain.
But now India itself has come to Trump’s attention. Derogating from the white house’s haudegen as the “kingdom of tariffs”, America deprived the emerging country of trade concessions for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, friction with India is, of course, just a side-show. America also looks at the world’s largest democracy through its security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China’s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvage of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh himself into safety.
However, the problem lies in a different place: The empirically substantiated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult situation in the socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness, which for too long suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state. Companies now receive faster building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more gripping insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for liquidating companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. Much has changed for the better in India from an economic perspective in the first five years of Modi. However, this does not apply in trade policy. Inspired by this, the national conservative government even set new barriers to protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, Modi is attached to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows all too well what kind of vocabulary western managers like. In essence, however, the "India First" advocate never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the foreclosure of their industries belong to the tribal voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
The funeral of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac will be buried next week in Paris. The former head of state will be buried on Monday in the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, reported the news agency AFP, referring to the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. On Sunday, a public funeral ceremony was scheduled in Paris’ Invalidendom, according to media reports.
Bringing the competitor to the finish line: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The top of the world was already in the finish line long ago, when heartwarming scenes took place in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium. Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to wave dangerously in the first forerun of the men over 5000 meters. He could barely hold himself on his feet about 300 meters before the finish line, ran in an unhealthy way, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly undercut him and supported him with the last half of the stadium round to the finish line. However, the forces were still sufficient for both of them to stop the watch running after the finish line. As if the scene had not already been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. Shy, he did not want to talk about his exploits at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he should not have even started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
That’s what he did on the evening – and much more intensely than he would have thought. Because this feat will remain in memory. Especially as Dabo even left his competitor Busby ahead of the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this preliminary run. In the end, it had done nothing, because the Busby, who only got to the finish line with much help, was disqualified at the end by the World Light Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had started to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this succeeded with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millionsmash: Egyptians Prepare for Wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible anti-government protests. An increased police presence was observed in the centre of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations were closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed.
Already in recent days, the police had stepped up their road controls and partly searched the mobile phones of pedestrians on news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there had been protests with hundreds of participants against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. Egyptian builder and actor Mohammed Ali, who was living in exile in Spain, who started the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "millions march" in central places in the country for this Friday. Ali calls for a "people's revolution". The man is not "good" for most young Egyptians either, because he was a sub-contractor for the army, but his messages are coming.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to increase according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be independently confirmed at first. The government also did not confirm or comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily arrested," "just because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW reported, referring to lawyers arrested. According to their lawyers, the allegations against the arrested range from "spreading false information" to membership in a "terrorist association." In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces questioned and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, and according to HRW information, also random passersby.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealers: Mail order dealers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be exempted from VAT on donations in kind, the Ministry explained to a question of the Greens-Bundestag group, which the newspapers of the Funke-Mediengruppe reported on Friday. However, traders could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they had to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the German citizens send back every sixth package of orders on the Internet. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - ended up in the garbage. According to current legal situation, to donate them would cost the companies additional money, because the financial authorities evaluate donations in kind like a turnover, which is then subject to VAT.
Green Group member Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies can evaluate non-sale products accordingly and donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other shops from fashion shops to DIY stores.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksys' work "emphasises the re-formation of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes." From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in the Bristol Museum in southwestern Britain in 2009, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had exhibited the painting again, at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change ownership for a million dollars.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a hard trade with the opposition at the first meeting of the House of Commons following the suspension of a forced break by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to implement the Brexit, which had already been postponed twice on 31 October, even without any agreements with the EU if necessary.
This is not the first time Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has intervened in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in south-eastern England, he painted a picture depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the factory every day when they enter the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
According to his top advisor, the fierce verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings at a book presentation on Friday. "We enjoy it. We will quit (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them, among other things, of "betrayal" of the people. He dismissed as "humbug" accusations that he could put the MPs in danger because they could become targets of death threats.
Mr Cummings said that the only way to calm down was if MEPs finally respected the British' decision to leave the EU. It was not surprising that people were upset that Britain had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the Bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak to each other with respect," said one statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan’s Prime Minister Khan Calls for Uno Intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance at the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the Uno General Debate in New York on Friday. "If that goes badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers dominate one part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn autonomy status from the Indian Kashmir region and thus suddenly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It shoots at the population with sharp ammunition, more than 2000 prisoners in the prisons join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything in its power to avoid a scenario like that of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions into the streets. And that’s a problem that el-Sisi’s regime can’t handle, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who you are financing: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the suppression but also the biggest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER boss: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
Two months of testing was carried out to determine whether the complex plant mesh in the BER fire protection system works in conjunction. Operators are satisfied with the process. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspections in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Chairman of the Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport Chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the timetable for commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should not be too large any more.The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the construction office in the course of the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables still have to be repaired; the Tüv wants to check them by February. "In order to create the conditions here for the start of flight operations, there is still a need to work intensively on the processing of the defects," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dowels on which the cable paths hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the crossing to the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily. The problems had led the project three years ago into another crisis. This time it is about smoke aprons, which run down in a fire like a screen, so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there will be new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally it should go into operation in 2011. Since the start of construction in 2006, the costs have increased from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the responsible parties are planning to expand the airport. This is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board will take place on 18 October, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Head of finance Heike Fölster is moving to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen retires next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She had put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Automats for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and blew up a lot of vending machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of blown-up cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police caught a 33-year-old German on Bürgerstraße and Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the introduction of explosive explosions into the crime unit with a particularly serious case of the theft, which was led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "He apparently financed his drug addiction with the loot." Four times alone, the bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on Bürgerstraße between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least €60,000!
The vending machine bomber is now in pre-trial custody and the police investigation against him continues.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further machine sprinkling in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is revising its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the competition with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights departing from Vienna", a press spokesman from Austrian Airlines confirmed to APA on Friday. "AviationNetOnline" had previously reported on this.
The Vienna base of Lufthansa’s Eurowings airliner will be de facto disbanded. Four of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft will remain in Vienna. These will be taken over by the AUA in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel, from January 2020. In future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the speaker explained. The flight times will be coordinated with connecting flights. The goal is, on the one hand, to strengthen the hub in Vienna and, on the other hand, to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna will only serve as a production company for the group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome will be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants will come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number will no longer be handled in Terminal 1, but in the same way as the AUA in Terminal 3.
A prize fight broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki-Pleite. Ryanair’s subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would be increased to 16 aircraft next summer. For this purpose, the Irish low-cost airline will send four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called “wetlease”, which the union criticized as a bypass construct to the collective agreement.
On Friday, Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair, said that Lauda will have passed the AUA in five years' time: "We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years' time."
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four marries. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) during the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month.
"We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly wait to be married," the couple, who have been together since October 2018 according to UK media reports, reported in the official announcement.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the years to come, full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and were also published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. The palace will announce more information about the date, place and everything else in the coming months.
It is certain, however, that the marriage of number nine of the British succession and the real estate mogul will be a similar celebration as the marriage of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition – there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the genetic material of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Via the analysis of the genetic material of 9000 people, Hamburg-based and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. The high mountain hospital Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved from Switzerland.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the main influencing risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not well known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Centre at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-causing changes in the DNA - so-called mutations -, according to the hospital. Each year about 200 would be added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Centre. New insights into the interaction between the heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a firm will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The hospital of the foundation in Davos has so far mainly dealt with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be established on the local medical campus and a professorship for bioinformatics is to be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics company living in Switzerland said that he had been operated on at an open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". According to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 test subjects. The scientists assured us that the genetic decoding is strictly concerned with the protection of the anonymised data. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to the UKE, a human genome can be decoded within 24 hours. The cost of this would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to start on 1 October, all 9000 samples are expected to be analyzed by the end of 2020. Initial results are expected the following year.
Nigerian police frees hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. According to evidence from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some minor victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been detained under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. Indeed, the protégés had been held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions," said Sabo. About a hundred pupils, including children aged nine years, had been chained up in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran school had existed for about ten years. Residents had drawn the attention of the authorities to repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents had been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They had not suspected of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee agency, therefore, more than 40,000 people fled over the border to the neighboring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and Tortured: Nigeria's Police Release 400 Children from School
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria released almost 400 students from appalling conditions. "Many of them were chained up and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
The children had been discovered there on Thursday after an indication in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "unworthy of man". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been held at their school like slaves and laid on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed emaciated and injured pupils in a clearly poor health condition.
World Football Election: Further accusations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Association is awarding the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. Lionel Messi is the sixth honor and thus the record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations came from other countries to the FIFA. Egypt was not judged at all - with a curious reason.
Much of the Fifa has proven to be objectionable in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Footballer election has not been suspected of being messy so far - if one refrains from the voteable national coaches and national team captains of the member federations often vote more in sympathy than objectively.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, there are now further inconsistencies: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
Fifa apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan’s Trainer Also Surprised
There is also an outcry from Sudan about the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was judged: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was taken in the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: "Did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
On Friday, the association reported: True, but of course it was not intentional. The completed electoral documents had been "mistakenly" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, according to a message from the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually been elected. "We take responsibility for the administrative error", said the communication. Both Rosa's and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases have now been examined by the FIFA, but stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans call for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have spoken out openly for an official investigation against US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said Republican Governor of Vermont State, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are established." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott Trump observed Biden "for years".
The Republicans have been holding back so far with criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower affair, and few have shown uneasiness about it. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also called for the investigation. “It’s a deeply disturbing situation,” said Baker. “The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it.”
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, have no formal say in the case against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, first Republican senators have also expressed criticism of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second parliamentary chamber, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also report that there were first cracks among Republicans internally.
The affair could lead to the initiation of an impeachment procedure against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into this, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no exact timetable for the impeachment procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment effort. However, the decision on a real impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the chances of success of such a procedure are low. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board of Rackete's Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, reportedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had sailed the port of Lampedusa illegally with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now there are new serious accusations against Rackete. Three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects were arrested in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any reliable information," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police reported in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured, and even murdered. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence," the communication said at that time.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. Therefore, it is quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed up."
Italy's right-wing ex-Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini immediately requested an apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk Aspires to Delivery Record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote to Tesla employees in an email published by the industry blog "Electrek".
Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's circular continued. The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly. To do so, Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of over six percent. Price hasn’t increased that much in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous best.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit figures are required for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
US budget dispute: once again just a bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in expenditure ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning on October 1st. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21st. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have occurred on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration will be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the 2019 financial year to be completed on Monday. This is because the Congress could not agree on the 12 expenditure laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit for the time being from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly capable of being a majority.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the Wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are disrupting the plans for the construction of the Wall and its financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the building of the wall the ghosts separate
At present it is unclear how the parties want to get closer on this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the background of the Congress' continued inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the funding of the federal administration would automatically continue at the previous year's level, prohibiting the travel activities of parliamentarians and holding back their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilisation will also be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill allowing all women to claim in vitro fertilisation, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations significantly.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also opposed to this innovation.
The new regulation is the core part of a bioethics law, which was defended by Health Minister Agnès Buzyn as "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the costs of artificial insemination for all women are to be borne by the social security.
Insemination with semen from dead husband further prohibited
By a very small majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the semen of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is permitted "post-mortem". In Germany, in the past, there have been cases in which women complain in vain about the delivery of the semen of a deceased person. Opponents of the move in Paris argued that such a child bears a "particularly grave fate".
On the other hand, many members of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken out in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be subjected to a "double mourning" if her wish for a child remained unfulfilled due to the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can in future be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
Until now, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot produce children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - however, it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: calls for a flight levy for universities are getting louder
A lot is being flown at the universities. Therefore, the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future too. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on a climate levy on flights from universities and higher education institutions, which was postponed before the summer break, is coming up again. After the country's Rectors' Conference had reacted sceptically to a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six universities in Baden-Württemberg and a school of education argue for compensation for service flights. This is the first step "urgently necessary", and at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, according to their opinion. The cabinet decision originally planned in July is meanwhile still on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the Greens' submission.
Russia once again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the prisoners were reported to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a shooting between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no casualties, they said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. North Korean fishermen were therefore on the move in Russian territorial waters. According to their own information, the coast guard of Russia is patrolling their marine biological resources there.
30,000 squid seized
During the new inspections, 30,000 squids had been discovered and confiscated on the boats. Furthermore, according to the data, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and transported to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s fisheries authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there for some time this year, according to the media.
Georgi Martynov, head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the far eastern Primorje region, recently also complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed.
In the future, only 18.000: USA lowers asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shutting itself off from those seeking protection: According to the State Department in Washington, the upper limit for the legal immigration of refugees is being further lowered. In future, mainly threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs from October 2019 to September 2020 in the United States, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department explained. In the almost past marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
In recent years, President Donald Trump’s government has drastically reduced the willingness to accept protection seekers from all over the world. Barack Obama’s predecessor government had seen far higher reception limits.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee program in 1980. Nevertheless, the State Department called the US "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the language use of the incumbent US president.
A "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. His hard course in migration policy has received a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to close off. In order to be able to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selenskyj affair and a potentially imminent impeachment proceedings.
The US government wants to focus on the reception of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and have thereby become in danger, as the statement by the State Department shows. However, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken in from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration at the US south border to Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a reception station for apes in the USA at the request of the Argentine judiciary. "Sandra", born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person", therefore her release is mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, she is to live in the free enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, "Sandra" has to endure a 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before being transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights, which was initiated by animal conservationists in 2014, has contributed to the transformation of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and education centre for the preservation of biodiversity will be established there.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Hussar ride at the nearly 3000 meter high Great Peak in the Italian Alps.
Without net, double bottom or other tools, the Swiss defeated the 550-metre-high north face of the Great Peak in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom of fraud, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus he defeated the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of Europe's six most important north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sporting goods manufacturer Nike recorded a significant profit increase, with net profit rising to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (just under €1.3 billion), 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period up to the end of August. Nike’s sales increased most strongly with a 22 percent increase in China. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited in the People’s Republic of China from its approach of directing itself to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Head of Finance Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to react to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and called on his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted late Thursday. He reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma adherent should never visit the club's game again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against rival black players. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. One has to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist chants at the first league match between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence last Sunday.
But there were also discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now imposed bans on 38 rioting fans of record champion Juventus Turin. Four of them are no longer allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed. Therefore, the rest are subject to bans of four to seven years.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. Among other things, the twelve are accused of serious extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had started the investigation with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders were behind the black market with tickets. They had "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and allegedly blackmailed Juventus employees in order to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the Generation Z is political - whole generations are considered with grippy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This was the official start of the crab catch at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun on 21 September, which also heralded the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee's Public Relations Department.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started to breed crabs in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that has provided high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun’s economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively engaged in a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as in technology-based crab farming, and the city has taken care of promoting greater efficiency in agriculture and farmers’ incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services" and has carefully built up the service network for "authorizations under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending" to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local benefits of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a signpost to locate smart high-end manufacturing companies, biomedicine and medical companies, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health industries, and organic farming companies that are leaders in the "3+2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national tourism zone covering all areas and tourist sites of national importance. Here, the environmental and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape have been integrated, the state of buildings for civil services and for the public service has been greatly improved, the areas "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" have been vigorously developed and the development of cultural tourism has been promoted at a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and the USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. In return, the United States had promised to end all sanctions in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted Iran’s counterpart on Twitter: “I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no.”
Ruhani describes the events as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had urged that a meeting be held. "And America says I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The nature of the sanctions that were to be ended had been up for debate. "And they clearly said that we are lifting all the sanctions."
However, this move had not taken place in an acceptable manner, Ruhani criticized. Given the current sanctions and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes shook Western Turkey in a very short time, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. As a result, the fear of a disaster is growing.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 on Thursday shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built housing collapses – among other things, the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces that have been registered as shelters in the centre have long been built up. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August had the Istanbul Civil Engineering Chamber warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul are not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the earthquake on Thursday was in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as reported by the civil protection authority Afad. A minor aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that no casualties or damage had been reported at first. TRT, the state station, showed people running out of their homes in panic. Pupils were taken out of the buildings for security reasons in the Silivri district. Some students were crying, as can be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian earth plates. Turkey is constantly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly quake was in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. During the earthquake on Thursday it hit again the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with everything they need to stand next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big quake comes is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured and that some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom), according to which two minarets of mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On the social networks, many users reported panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday’s, writes one user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned of aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the quake is 1:59 p.m. (local time). According to CNN Turkey, only a few minutes after the first quake, there was an aftershock with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it could be felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the civil protection authority Afad informed already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually unload - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy reckons that the earthquake is now a warning. This has made it more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a major earthquake," Ersoy told the transmitter. "Early or later the great quake will also come."
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania there had also been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also at Lake Constance the earth had trembled this year.
Parliament: New ignition fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide for new explosives in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the U.S. Democrats are encouraged: The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian President provides important clues for investigations against the President. Trump himself once again sees himself as the victim of a "witch hunt." Moreover, he questioned the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passengers locked in toilet - pilot redirected
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight was diverted from United Airlines. According to the US media, the toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco.
At an off schedule stopover in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time), the woman was finally released from the narrow cabin. She had been locked in it for about an hour, U.S. media wrote invoking other passengers. Passengers had to change the plane to continue their flight to San Francisco.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which according to the U.S. media is supposed to come from flight 1554, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. Initially, it was open to whether the woman was getting compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", British hit author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "Die Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on 27 November, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) informed. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is determined to let nothing and nobody stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If the parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once, if Brexiteers in high positions almost implore the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write." McEwan had only appeared in the spring of the novel "Machines Like Me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first story, published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into an enormous vermin," gradually being excluded from family and society, and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands head," said Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria’s rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce the noise pollution caused by freight trains. Moreover, sections of the railway links between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travel cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all trips until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travels "could not be started for insolvency reasons", the company announced on Thursday evening.
Bookings by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid for or paid for in full, are also affected. The company left open the question of travel starting on 1 November 2019. In consultation with the insolvency insurance company, the further procedure was examined, according to the company.
Thomas Cook in Germany was in the throes of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money back to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday onwards, hotels abroad, which currently still host Thomas Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from Zurich Insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer required to make extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without presenting separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as one Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook travelers are not required to pay hotel bills individually or otherwise from these hotels," said Spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their accommodation on site, so some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
The insurance spokesman said how many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook holidaymakers from Germany were still on the road. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return travel of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are still on the road. Thomas Cook customers, who want to fly on holiday, look bad. On late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travels until 31 October will be cancelled. This also applies to those bookings that have already been paid.
The company left open the question of travel starting on 1 November 2019. In consultation with the insolvency insurance company, the further procedure was examined. In principle, the insurance company Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about possibilities of refunding the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys mine in Angola
For a long time Prince Harry has continued the engagement of Lady Diana. In Africa he is now walking directly on the tracks of his mother.
In Angola, British Prince Harry detonated and destroyed an explosive mine with a blue shard jacket.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit in front of TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded in the savannah landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa Harry then wanted to walk in the city of Huambo directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same blastmaster who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to travel the way she was going back then. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She too had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly stated that he would not guarantee a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements have been made in the polarizing British for a long time. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the UK hovers over the Blond Schopf like a Damocles sword. His suspension of the parliament in order to be able to carry out its Brexit course stubbornly by the end of the week was cancelled earlier this week. And a law passed by the parliament obliges Johnson to effect an extension of the bilateral talks in the event of failed negotiations with the EU by 31 October. Johnson, however, had categorically ruled this out again and again.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
But the pressure does not seem to go far past Johnson either. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he suggested that if there was a disagreement, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And it's best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running out for Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have about six weeks left to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. However, the recent talks have again failed to achieve a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a new postponement of the exit date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister’s words. She fears that Johnson might somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
U.S. authorities: Other e-cigarette deaths
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the US has risen to 12. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injured in this context, the US health agency CDC informed. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine" there have already been more than 900 people affected, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage is known in Europe so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared millions of times in online networks, where the construction contractor and actor living in Spain is calling for a "people's revolution." For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes mass demonstrations with one million participants in central places of the country.
The security authorities are alarmed at any rate. In the center of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. In recent days the police had already strengthened their road controls and partly searched the mobile phones of pedestrians on news and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW reported under appeal to lawyers arrested.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox of Greenland Expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. When he arrived at the port of Hamburg, he was greeted by skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg, who had taken the race yacht "Malizia" across the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher. He had waited for years for the young generation to speak. One knows for decades that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under exclusion from the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the waste of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, a drone of Greenlandic glacial ice was surveyed and nets were fished for microplastics, they said.
The polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "struggle for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model," Skipper Boris Herrmann said at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades."
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: this seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which caused heated reactions.
"Such cases harm Rome's reputation. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the Association of Travel Guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The restaurant owners responded promptly. Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not apparent from the invoice. A tip of up to 20 percent of the invoice is also normal, the innkeeper said.
A phone call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an impeachment procedure after the turbulent revelations of recent days, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is of weeks before a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the whistleblower, who finally brought the conversation out of concern for the national security and for the democracy of the USA with his complaint to the public, is monstrous: The president misused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the election 2020. He used the dependence of Ukraine thereby blackmailfully and thus wanted to force them to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be traced in the meanwhile published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reproduce the complete text. However, the phone call of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the focus, besides Trump, is above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view, the story begins in May 2019, when Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine are reported by the New York Times. He wants to meet with the newly elected president Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are sensitive. "We don't interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation into what we have the right to do," he says to the newspaper. One might think it is inappropriate, but "there is nothing illegal about it." Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine, for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could prove to be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former mayor of New York seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies, which are fixed on Trump's rival candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, in order to construct an occasion for the Russia investigations in the USA. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will be talking about on the phone with Selenskyj in July. Giulianis and the President’s version reads: former Vice President and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, as the Obama administration’s Ukraine representative, has urged the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Schokin, in order to stop the investigation of the gas company on whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden worked. Biden senior has been financially blackmailing Ukraine to cover up the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact, the process was a little different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General leave, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also accused of deeply corrupt conduct himself, the US government was far from being the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Interferences with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, the UK and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allerstörungen.de users report that Facebook has not been loading since about 3.30 p.m. again and again. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disruption, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by interference
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had been cancelled for several hours. And, as in the previous cases, this time users use Twitter mainly to make their anger air.
Polish Scientists Saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the ice of Antarctica by the Chilean Air Force. They were on their way with a dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we got the news, at about ten we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the dinghy".
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977 and 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER wirelessly charge
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should still not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come onto the market, which support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If a mobile phone is charged normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In case of wireless charging, however, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role in this. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but also does not last that long. Therefore, the lifetime is lower. Therefore, the researchers advise that the smartphone should always be charged by cable. Since a battery exchange is always associated with high costs for modern smartphones, this is probably a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of a battery exchange once again - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salads and tedious plug-flipping. Since Qi (which stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, in which exceptionally even Apple participates, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest Stau photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and set a record, his expedition operator informed.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: from him comes a photo of mountain climbers on Mount Everest, which went viral in the spring.
The image of the mass crowd triggered a debate about stronger safety measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and the highest summit of the earth. In May, eleven climbers had died during the ascent within a few days.
One problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. One reason for this is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to enable him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman reported on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This is usually done when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. Their killing is theoretically subject to the death penalty.
Holden British oil tanker leaving Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it was established by Iran. According to the news agency IRNA, the seafaring agency Bandar Abbas announced this. Iranian Revolutionary Guards had imposed the British flag tanker on 19 July on charges of disregarding the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the review
The House of Commons' responsible economic committee wants to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook in a comprehensive manner. It is about the salary packages of the board of directors as well as the question why the British government did not want to contribute financially to the company fighting for survival. "Our interest is in the supervision of the company as well as the control by external accountants," stated the chairman of the committee Rachel Reeves in London. "It is obvious that we are dealing with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the familial increased risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as familial eating habits are therefore likely to weigh more heavily than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual intestinal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk Increases Tesla Shares
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla staff published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it was further in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to get the cars to customers quickly. Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of circulation with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased that much in almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered a good 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous best.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. Six-digit figures are required for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there have been losses.
Will the British government bypass Brexit law? Johnson reserved
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a low profile as to whether he is looking for ways of circumventing the law against an unregulated Brexit recently passed by Parliament. On Friday, he merely told journalists that his government would abide by the law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the exit date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after leaving the EU.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is through an agreement."
Iran apparently ramps up uranium enrichment
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on European contractors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. “Unfortunately, European states show inability or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions,” said Rohani at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday. In the event that they did not abide by their promises, he promised “further steps” away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained in return the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the US unilaterally stepped out of the agreement to force Iran to change course with "maximum pressure" in the policy of the Middle East considered aggressive. The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and now again relies on tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran responded lastly with a resurgence of the limited uranium enrichment in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or prepared for use the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to bear their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of US sanctions, Rohani speculated. Nevertheless, there would be further talks that hopefully would bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran’s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the crowds changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US estimate that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen had committed to the attack, but this was considered a false confession by the US. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations have to provide evidence of this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders could not have done that in the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they only claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, France’s President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, Rohani demanded that the far-reaching sanctions imposed by the US administration be lifted. He called on the government in Washington to turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet of other star crisscrossing solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was first achieved. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn on other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The well-traveled comet had been discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Follow-up observations by various observatories confirmed not only that it was an unknown comet, but also that it did not come from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017 only the second interstellar object, which was sighted during a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov provides astronomers with a rare chance to gain close insights into a foreign solar system before disappearing on never-again. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the Sun at this distance," reported Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa in a statement.
According to the analyses, the comet is on the road on a hyperbolic orbit that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially listed under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was named 2I/Borisov, the first part of which indicates that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov was already spotted in the approach. Thus, the researchers will stay for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and can then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already conducted the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object for 2 to 16 kilometres in a first study. Images of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already acquired a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles those of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way of researching certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often they are. One of the next interstellar visitors might be able to intercept a planned satellite mission by the European space agency Esa.
Until 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German for example comet interceptor) on a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, it is to either lurk for an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just in time before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, the new mega-airport in the south of China's capital city is home to China United Airlines' first passenger aircraft, a special honour for the captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are scheduled to be handled annually at the new airport, and by 2025, 72 million are expected to be handled. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “Seestern” because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four runways to be expanded to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly said that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the – and much smaller – capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has been postponed so far. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger plane landed after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours, the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming of making this supersonic-speed flight possible, which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire is developing for the 2030s, a special drive (Synergic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish this," said agency director Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date, the Concorde covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003 and took three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft, the "X-Plane", together with the US space authority Nasa. Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on his homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft could also be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable cream travel equipment".
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about the US President's possible abuse of power, Donald Trump wants to track down potential leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday in front of employees of the U.S. embassy at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy", and in the past they were "a bit different" than they are today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tippers. The event was actually not public. However, several U.S. media broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the President’s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced preparations for an impeachment trial against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Following great public pressure, the descriptions of the whistleblower had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, Whistleblower claims to have received information from several government officials that the U.S. president "uses the power of his office" to get another country involved in the U.S. election in 2020 in his favor.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This concerns former business of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice. Biden is ahead in the race for the Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of concealing the Ukrainian phone call: Leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been drawn up. However, this had been removed from a database, which was usually intended for this purpose, after the discussion by White House lawyers, and instead was stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not known to the public. The "New York Times" reported that it should be an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called whistleblower had spread second-hand information that would have proved to be incorrect. Therefore, there might be no tippers or spies at all.
As Trump spoke in New York about those who were supposed to have leaked information to the whistleblower, he was outraged. US House of Representatives Chairman Nancy Pelosi reacted with concern and complained that Trump’s statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
Various investigations against Trump and his surroundings have been going on in the House of Representatives for months now in various committees. In view of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead investigations with new force in order to initiate a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
"The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said Adam Schiff, head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things and again demanded the resignation of the chairman of the committee. Trump regularly insulted Schiff and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign affairs sectors, most of whom were under democratic but also Republican presidents, supported the democrats' investigation for a possible impeachment procedure in a statement published on Friday. Should the allegations prove true, Trump said it would be "an unscrupulous abuse of power."
There is no exact timetable for the further process. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could use what is known as an impeachment procedure. However, the decision to withdraw from office would be taken in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the chances of success of such a procedure are low. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW works council: jobs are being "scrubbed" down
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concerns the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros from ten billion euros to 2023. Of these, 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
A key to this is personnel costs. The "future pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be reduced by the car manufacturer if it is proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security applies until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in the production, which were not actually at the disposition, are "slowly" dismantled by another way - i.e. by the official course. Thus, free-coming regular jobs would often not be filled again.
In these cases, the works council had no possibility of forcing the re-occupation. Meanwhile, in many places, there was a lack of staff who were increasingly concentrated in work, the concerns about a gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants would become greater. Thus, the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world, was also growing. VW only said: "As agreed, the employment volume is adjusted socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and centrally manage new projects. This is also intended to reduce costs and speed up decisions – the aim behind this is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. At a manager conference in Berlin Andreas Tostmann, Chief Production Officer, said: "We are well advised to make ourselves resilient to the crisis, especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the USA and China."
There are already successes in this direction: for example, this year, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would decrease compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. VW does not mention exact figures on the production time, according to information from our newspaper, it amounts to around 7 in the Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg parent plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars have to be built each year to ensure that the plant is sufficiently profitable. However, in 2018 the capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the decreasing demand for diesel and the problems with the conversion to the new WLTP fuel consumption and exhaust gas test method.
As production director Tostmann announced last year, however, "perspectively" one million cars are to roll off the production line in Wolfsburg. This is supposed to make the bundling of the golf production in the parent plant possible - because the Zwickau plant will hand over the golf production through the conversion to the location for e-car production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build up e-mobility, it should remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburg for the time being.
Forced to Prostitution with Voodoo: Traffickers Sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have taken oaths, been smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six alleged traffickers have to go to prison for this.
On Friday, six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months in Bochum. The accused had sent young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. To force their obedience, the Nigerian women who wanted to leave had to take a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest in their homeland.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in dinghy boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arrived in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to work off the alleged squealer costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the intrusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians to brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and psychologically difficult to do," said judge Isabel Hoffmann during the verdict. "Some were really disgusted."
The verdicts are in the form of industrial and gang infiltration of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants' union Ufo has once again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "inform on 14 October about the industrial action measures in the LH Group", informed Ufo tariff board Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to negotiate collective bargaining with the Ufo for months. This also concerns the question whether the union has lawfully terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to have it determined that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal against it. "I consider it unlikely that a second court sees the case completely differently," said Ufo board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt to have the status of UFO as a trade union reviewed by the court.The company argues that the union has not set up an authorised board of directors for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, during which numerous members of the board as well as of the advisory board resigned, including the long-standing union leader Nicoley Baublies. Ufo had suspended an initial vote on cabin workers' strikes at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about their leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is about to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia intends to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the tourism commission stated, the aim is to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult for tourists to access. Visas are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the ErzkonservativeKingdom hopes for more income from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two of the most important oil rigs in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churai oil field. As a result, national oil production fell sharply, oil prices rising. It is expected that it will take several weeks for the Kingdom’s oil production to return to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in their Instagram stories on Thursday (local time). Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colourful suits printed with bananas on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry churchly next weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers gave themselves the "yes" word in a New York registry office. There had not been a major celebration at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police reported. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had sent an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use during the search. The cause of the accident still has to be determined. The crash site lies about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, reported the World Nature Conservation Union IUCN in Brussels on Friday. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of these are not found on any other continent. 58 percent of these 265 are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "at risk", "strongly endangered", "at risk of extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct". In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species as endangered worldwide.
Scotch and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) is particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency. "Most of them are threatened because the populations are small or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild ordinary horse chestnuts. They have been regarded as "hazardous" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat, besides a fungus, is the Balkan miner moth. It spreads from south-eastern Europe over the whole continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe on less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrubs and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists also produced new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority".
Earthquake in front of Istanbul: 34 injured reported
The recent earthquake in Turkey injured 34 people. According to the figures, there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the quake the previous day there had been almost 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 on Thursday shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, announced Oktay. In the past 20 years Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian earth plates.
One of the heaviest quakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul at that time. More than 17,000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday a quake of magnitude 4.6 shook the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the half-time show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl, announced by the singers on Twitter. "It won't be any bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is very excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had been dreaming of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL lasts 100 years and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She could hardly wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she was honored to be on one of the largest stages in the world alongside another artist and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queen" were on a stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining audiences
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you’ve dropped the number of viewers last time: This February, the show attracted the fewest viewers in the US for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
In the run-up to the half-time show of the previous Super Bowl, there had been turmoil: In the dispute over dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear last February according to media reports. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, at that time the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, got to his knees in the 2016/17 season in front of NFL games at the National Anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been clubless since March 2017 and has no longer contested NFL-partie. He accuses the clubs of not hiring him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to face a high level of bankruptcy by travel provider Thomas Cook. Credit Suisse is also at risk of high write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans, writes the "Financial Times" in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse would probably have to write down up to £1.8 billion (about €2 billion) on their books in total, according to the report. This was shown by estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners.
Creditors of bonds would have to accept write-downs of £900 million to £1 billion and lenders of £550 to £825 million. The amounts actually to be written off are likely to be at the upper end of the range, one expert told the paper.
The extent of the losses of the creditors in the end will become apparent after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person close to the proceedings did not exude too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook’s 40 or so aircraft were “old” in the UK and many of the properties were in poor locations. Most money could probably be taken out by selling the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, it was further said.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any reliable information," said the spokesperson of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy and were accused of raping, torture and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organisations could not check who they had sent on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29th and had rammed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day the three suspects arrived there as well. The captain is under investigation for aiding illegal immigration.
USA warn federal government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great," Pai told the "Handelsblatt" regarding the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security authorities.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," continued the FCC CEO. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand from suppliers a "declaration of trust".
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "Handelsblatt" reports, relying on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not just hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It would be "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque. The employee company, which allegedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
The U.S. would have found that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the U.S. position.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
During the night, local residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French town of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities the facilities would not open up on Friday as a precaution, the responsible prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injured. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that after the extinguishing smell will spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture 240 firefighters as well as 90 police officers and gendarmes were in action at the fire village.
A gigantic black smoke column had risen from the chemical factory before. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city centre.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident had occurred in Seveso near Milan, Italy.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples at first. However, pollution of the nearby Seine cannot be ruled out. In the river dams had been built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 2:40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause was initially unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine River between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest and now, the sooner the better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is faltering, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to make the necessary decisions".
Le Maire said that action would have to be taken by those states that would have budgetary room for more investment, including Germany.
France has no room for manoeuvre, the Minister added, pointing to his country’s high public debt, which is more than 98 percent of GDP. French public debt must be “stabilised” and “denied,” said Le Maire.
In recent years, appeals have repeatedly been made to Germany from France to make more public investments in order to stimulate the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to manage its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is thus reacting to the protests of the Yellow Vest movement, among other things. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson evades question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson harshly criticizes the "capitulation law" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-brexit. Critics fear, however, that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician evades this possibility.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a low profile on whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit – despite the law recently passed by Parliament, which is exactly what he wants to prevent. Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by the law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the date of withdrawal should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law until after leaving the EU. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to reach an agreement."
Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said that he regards the political disputes surrounding Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the intended exit from the EU would still be achieved: "We will enjoy this, we will win, we will leave the EU (ed.): don't worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" at a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, now serves as the chief strategist in the British government seat of Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (pockets) plunges deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the illustrated book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona, until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, a few hundred of them are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course there is always one in the center: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephones in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland also led a very normal life. Thus, according to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And also it has not always been tidyed up with the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to snap it at the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney.

"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from its neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies had withdrawn "because of the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran secretly pursues a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
U.S. government wants to restrict reception of refugees
On Thursday, the US State Department stated that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said that while the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
The US government wants to focus on the reception of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the State Department statement shows. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, will receive a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The programme, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the programme’s history. Even the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama left the White House, the figure was almost 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted horribly to the announced lowering of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would thus continue to damage its leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US, both legally and illegally. According to his own information, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a snitch"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage. Whoever has given the informant, who accuses him of abuse of power, "comes close to a snitch," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. Several US media report this in agreement.
So Trump spoke to employees of the American UN mission. When he was asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This comes close to a snitch." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayals, we used to deal with it a bit differently than we do now."
Observers considered the latter remark to be a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticized Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. Moreover, it was an attempt to hinder a congress inquiry into a possible impeachment procedure against him, wrote the chairmen of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Supervision in the House of Representatives.
The whistleblower accuses the president of using his office in order to request interference from another country in the U.S. election in 2020 in a now published complaint. Specifically, his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer was about: In the conversation Trump advised him to initiate investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informant are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA’s foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat capsized: baby and toddlers drown in Aegean
Again and again people try to come from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. However, the often too small boats regularly capsize. In the sinking of a dinghy seven migrants have now died - among them five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios seven migrants were killed in the sinking of a dinghy boat. Among the fatalities were also a baby and four other children, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is said to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known from which countries the migrants come from. Currently hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in too small boats. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The Who cancel concert
A U.S. concert by the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end due to the indisposition of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to work. In the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should let it go while it still runs".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey "can't really speak now." Townsend promised the audience to get their money's worth at a reparation concert. However, an appointment is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver scheduled performances canceled The Who. They are to be made up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear billions of dollars in revenue.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. A few days ago, the company had sold founder Adam Neumann as boss, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for the executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times" reports that WeWork has stopped the completion of new rentals with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly out of the market.
WeWork rents large office space over the long term and leases it to members in some small units at short notice. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork burns money at a breathtaking speed with this business. Last year, the company incurred a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs are said to have increased to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars by renting more and more large areas. To limit the loss, the new management is now said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented nearly 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months. WeWork’s new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new areas that came onto the market at that time. Without WeWork’s expansion, the office vacancy in the U.S. metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the “Business Insider”. Similarly, in London, WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in the best location.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could be noticeably shifting without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis, which was bought last year by savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the expected billions of revenues. They do not have access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork usually takes place by each of the subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia once again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 poachers who had illegally fished in the waters were arrested, according to the Russian national intelligence service FSB to the Interfax agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them injured. This time, there were no casualties, they said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian territorial waters. According to their own information, the coast guard of Russia is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources. During the new inspections 30,000 squids have been discovered. In addition, according to three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the coast guard detected a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there for some time in 2019, according to the media.
Georgi Martynov, head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the far eastern Primorje region, recently also complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. They also brought small creatures out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decommissioned. Even the ships themselves would not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured during the arrests the previous week. According to the FSB, a North Korean also wounded later died of his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one after it had opened fire.
USA impose entry ban on ex-President Castro
The United States has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, which the American Foreign Ministry explained in a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in "great human rights violations." As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he is presided over a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, Fidel Castro's brother, who had died, was also guilty of human rights abuses by the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said American foreign minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had declared entry bans against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro’s government to bring him to his knees and to give power to the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro’s closest allies. The Socialist Caribbean Island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are expected to start because of the time lag before the protests across Europe to North America. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how great the worldwide popularity of this Friday after the record participation of the previous week will be. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people went on strike for the climate. We will do it again this Friday!" she wrote on Twitter. So far there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
A good third of all demonstrators worldwide - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to Fridays for Future estimates. According to a list of the movement, demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had stood before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 in order to call on the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This led to the Fridays for Future movement within a short time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against earth heating and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be reduced to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived in New York just under a month ago after a two-week transatlantic cruise with a high-sea racing yacht, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke with a strong conscience to the heads of state and government of the world. In her native Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony, which will change fire safety. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow, according to the Tass agency. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes nevertheless must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, the penalty will be higher. According to the Ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also meat skewers on the balcony are not allowed.
Attack against Cybercriminals - Investigators Raise Servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time launched a large server provider for illegal business on the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected to have hosted numerous websites in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Mosel, via the international criminals operating their activities.
This was announced by the Attorney General’s Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Among other things, suspect customers are said to have been the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had smashed in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the cyber bunker, according to the Attorney General's Office.
Such a hoster had been removed for the first time in Germany, it was said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9 there were searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon the investigators want to inform about further details.
New Global Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
Protests are planned in at least 65 cities in Germany, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests Who are Thunberg's backers?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. This makes it all the more surprising that a 16-year-old girl, of all people in power at this time, is holding the mirror in front of the people of power. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and encourages young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time, he also managed to win a crowd of young people for himself and persuaded them to cross the sea to enter the promised country, similar to the way Greta Thunberg recently set out on a sailing boat to America.
But is there a shadowy side to this? Why does it take a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has sold far reaching, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also tried and tested followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably too big on some successors. This is also not without reason, because the action was very well seen in the media around the world and there is a lot of money flowing thanks to the impressive action.
Is it morally right to enrich oneself financially when saving the world? Is it even more authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue campaign? No matter which position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question seemingly pious intentions of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is breaking through our solar system right now.
Astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet of another star is currently crossing our solar system. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
This body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked up to the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was seen during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and currently moves on a so-called hyperbolic path that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before the time comes, astronomers will be able to observe him closely, because, unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in its approach, which means that it can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and will be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the U.S. Space Agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings on comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comet - because as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our colleague Javier Licandro, added de León.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids keep the researchers busy. Only recently a giant asteroid passed the earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson horrified at brother
Boris Johnson becomes more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister, with clear words, scourges the warlike language of the prime minister as "flavorless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly upgrading - at least verbally. At the House of Commons Question Time this Wednesday, this was met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime, other critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the broadcaster Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, pulled out, quartered, tarred and feathered." She considered this to be extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had taken part in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
In particular, she stumbled upon the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly member of the House who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 referendum. Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons that the best way to honor their memory was by going through Brexit. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member of parliament who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," now criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come from the far-right camp, which feels strengthened by "this kind of language."
The widower of Cox also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand passionately and resolutely for what one believes - no matter what one thinks. But one must never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned from office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory's deputy. "In recent months, I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson’s language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. According to the Times, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is “not worthy of this country”. In a joint statement, they stated: “In recent days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside the Parliament. We should speak with respect to each other.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is setting a strong signal in the year of its 100th anniversary: in the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots perform, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming final of the US Football League NFL, announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the US," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2nd in Miami. In the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl putting two women on the stage this time - and two Latins," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and will be shown in German cinemas in the drama "Hustlers" starting in November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the US every time. This year, many also regard the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sports event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. Usually, the NFL finale is watched by well over 100 million TV viewers, and it is now extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, political controversy precipitated. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who, in protest against police violence against blacks, refused to rise up at the play of the national anthem and had been harshly attacked by US President Donald Trump among others. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 appeared was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber is adding Egypt's ruler: But Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad for the time being.
The two men who have an influence on whether blood is flowing again on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad. One of them floated back to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who removed Muslim brother Mohammed Morsi, the country’s first freely elected head of state, in 2013, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi’s action against political Islam and lost no syllable about the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt’s security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had “no reason to worry,” Sisi said at the airport in the microphones of the state television. “The Egyptians don’t let themselves be misled.”
In the opinion of the president, this is what the other man is trying to mislead, who is currently determining what is happening on the streets. Mohamed Ali of course remained abroad, where he evades the access of the security forces, who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafés, living rooms and tearooms: With his YouTube channel "Mohamed's Secrets", Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president indulges in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said there. Ali accuses the army leadership on which Sisi bases his reign of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with these gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a construction contractor, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After last week, for the first time since Sisis Griff had demonstrated thousands against his rule and nearly 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "millions march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would really venture into the streets. But there were some minor protests, for example in Giza near Cairo and in Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests, whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos could not be verified independently at first. Security circles said that the police had stopped the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators tore banners with the president's portrait to pieces last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the outposts. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city centre were closed for "maintenance work", most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And in Rabaa Square, where supporters of the overthrown Muslim brother Morsi were entrenched in 2013 until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent discontented people from gathering: Sisi's Future Party, of all people, wanted to hold a grand rally here for the president.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers." However, as a backslider, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different testing possibilities.
Anyone who enters into an internet contract does not need to blindly trust the speed information provided by the providers. Customers can themselves check how much of it is actually achieved in case of anomalies.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre Bayern.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities. For example, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated", says the Bayern Consumer Centre on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised performance. This is best done by writing a letter of formal notice.
If this does not affect anything even after several requests, customers can terminate their contract and may also demand damages. However, in the absence of success, only the legal remedy will help.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
The Governor of Vermont was the first high-ranking Republican to speak out for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are established," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the President - is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump observed Biden "for years."
Up to now, Republicans have been holding back with criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have shown uneasiness about it. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned several times against Trump’s policies, such as the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Further Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how things should continue with the movies around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". Several U.S. media report this in agreement. According to this, the cinema launch should already be established: In the USA, the film will start from 16 July 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidey's path continues in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel is said to have made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also includes Marvel, would participate in the revenues of Spider-Man films with 30 percent. However, the news is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the grand finale. In the last episode, there were many happy endings and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, were paid a charming tribute. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a last farewell as Rachel Zane, at least for new scenes. Instead, some reviews showed the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his serving sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) steps straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a significant remark about his suit. Whether he actually threw over a skirt, the stunned Harvey wants to know about the groom, only to then snippishly remark: "Louis, you are not the prince of England".
Aegean: Baby and four more children drown in boat crash
A baby and four other children drowned while capping a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea. Seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced his intention to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wanted to "inform Turkey about the refugee situation", said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens, in order to be able to help deal with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson for the European Commission confirmed Seehofer's planned trip with EU Commissioner for the Interior Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, according to the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in numbers has led to doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which allows the EU to send back all refugees and migrants illegally coming to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take in a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side due to a lack of staff. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, almost 29 400 people are waiting for Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 migrats are currently housed in a camp with capacities for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 have there been so many, the state radio reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "very certain" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system caused high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time and led to increased heart attacks. Above all, people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo breakdown
The leader of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign, was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian green boss holds a reusable cup in her hand in a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Green Party, never held the reusable coffee cup with metal straw in her hand. On the party's website she was on a photo with this cup, talking to citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a nasty (Papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss has to answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the Fake News party was producing in order to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection", in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons, in which Trudeau is also finding it increasingly difficult due to a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and fanned the discussion about fake news. A user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and affirmed on her blog that she did not know about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she put it correctly, is made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokesperson of the party said that it was only about placing the party logo in the picture, not about covering up something. From the photo on the website only a section can be seen.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asked her over-engaged team: "If they want to work on a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also come to Shitstorms because of their use of one-way plastic or because of air travels - but their pictures were not photoshopped. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: life-long flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng is said to have been promised an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class free of charge.
This case shows, however, how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram follow Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30th she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the way out, Jaqueline refused to upgrade, even though she presented an e-mail in which Cathay Pacific allegedly offered her an upgrade. The letter said that the influencer had received it from an airline marketing staff member, while the airline accused Jaqueline of falsifying the e-mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman presented the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were sceptical: they were following up at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail allegedly came is said to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline staff at the airport cancelled Jaquelines Ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about €1,280) she had to buy a new flight tick to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had refunded her the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. The airline’s terms and conditions also state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices give way according to report on armistice in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest possible time on Friday afternoon. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the course slide was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities had brought five percent of global oil production to a halt in mid-September. The Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, one can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Raw Materials Strategy Department at the Saxo Bank of Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices are thus continuing their downward trend over the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent nearly $65.
Most recently, Bloomberg, relying on insiders, had reported that repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia progressed faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. According to this, the production volume had reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved again towards the original quantity.
Recently, there have been several press releases referring to insiders reporting on rapid progress made by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, resource experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relief in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way to leaving the port more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recently issued release.The crew now prepared the departure while the ship is still at anchor, shipping director Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the US announced that it would transfer defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian arch-enemy in Saudi Arabia. Fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and Great Britain had pushed oil prices up sharply in recent weeks.
Allegations against Trump are intensifying
In the case of the US President Donald Trump’s possible abuse of power, allegations of cover-up against the White House have been made. Several leading government officials had made intensive efforts to prevent access to the text of the conversation at the end of July following a dispute between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. This was declared by an anonymous whistleblower. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of “hiddenness”. Trump spoke of a “witch hunt”.
North Korea deems Trump and Kim’s third summit to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that in the nuclear dispute there will soon be a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. Kim Kye-gwan, senior diplomat, said Friday, according to the agency KCNA, the purpose and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in implementing agreements reached at the first summit in Singapore.
The US had not done anything to implement the summit's decisions last year, said the adviser to the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticised the US sanctions and the joint military manoeuvres of the US and South Korea. However, he hoped for Trump's "wise" and "courageous" decision to bring it closer again.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit meeting with Kim was to bring about before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have stalled since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. In doing so, they agreed to revive the discussions, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapon manufacturers to help with mine clearance
In Angola, British Prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed an explosive mine. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near Dirico, he produced the ignition circuit. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded. Looking at the goal of getting Angola free of mines by 2025, he later demanded in front of running TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names stand on these weapons, but who have not helped to clear the way to commit themselves to help".
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of an early interest rate cut, the pound is losing its value against the euro.
Frankfurt’s speculation that the Bank of England (BoE) would cut interest rates soon increases the pound sterling, and the British currency on Friday was reduced by up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars.
Sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who talked about a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, as Saunders is regarded as a defender of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the broker house ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy caused by the Brexit hack without directly signaling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU on 31 October, if necessary, even without a divorce agreement.
More: The British Prime Minister took a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Materials from the Moscow analysis laboratory are being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's integrity chief of the Athletics World Association.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia come to the fore - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and only to some extent. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: They were forged.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed, and the Wada had closed the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. After an individual examination, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes compete under neutral flags at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, while 168 Russian athletes competed at the winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the various sports, and in summer the World Cup with the host took place in Russia.
Missing positive findings
The following September, the Wada picked up the Rusada ban again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data was to provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during state doping. They were to help punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Athletics World Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory have been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force received the right data," said David Howman in the Friday interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung". "We found numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower and those that they received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing, which were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup Not Affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization to hold on to the spell of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put manipulations in the room and asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the renewed suspension of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
