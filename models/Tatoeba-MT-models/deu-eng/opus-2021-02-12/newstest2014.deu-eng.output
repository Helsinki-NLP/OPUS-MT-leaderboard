Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday in Gutach the new B 33 pedestrian ramp at the village parking lot was put into operation - within sight of the older town hall ramp.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or tortoise craze?
That question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The town hall lamp was installed at that time, because it secures the way to school," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel secure both cyclists as well as bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
The plant, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"The high traffic and pedestrian traffic required another traffic light to ensure their safety," says Eckert.
Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg confirms this.
"According to current measurements on the B 33, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about ten percent are heavy goods traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of a further traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety is just what happens here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a roundabout was also considered, but due to the narrowness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before when selecting the location of the traffic lights: "By means of a transporter specially loaded with particularly long logs, we tested whether these vehicles can go out from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without bending the traffic lights."
The traffic light system itself, which costs around EUR 15 000, is the "most modern thing currently available on the market," explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights can be clearly seen by the drivers, for example, even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new only eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, comes immediately green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be stopped.
"If a group or disabled people cross the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone is safe on the road," explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver has to think along as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: As soon as the traffic light for pedestrians showed green, an upper-class vehicle rushed through - in bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The Carinthian poet has often described the catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - speechlessness, the tendency to raw violence and dull sexuality, narrowness and joylessness.
The Büchner Prize winner is mainly known as a prose author, while theatrical texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prose Texts Gerhard Fresacher therefore composes a collage of prose texts for his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in Garage X at Petersplatz.
The theatre maker, for example, combines elements from the autobiographically coined novel "Der Leibneigen" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd) (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa, on which the text material is copied and masturbated - the eight-piece ensemble shuffles through.
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text.
The 70-minute performance overwashes the original with a wealth of directorial ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses get involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic realizations.
They are touched hard, dipped with their heads under water, tacked against the wall with their evening robes.
Compressed in cellophane or bodice, they stoke through the production on dangerously high sticks, either monologizing loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly conveyed in this strenuous way.
The evening has the best moments when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end the overturned performance calms down a bit, and Winkler's subsequent absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of every car.
The devices that record every kilometer driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing American roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the kilometers driven – and possibly where they were driven – and then using the information to calculate tax rulings.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of concerns about data protection.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we're going to use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record the miles driven with all California drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by the taxes, pays Americans at the pump, is broke.
But in America, not as much fuel is fueled as it used to be.
Cars consume less fuel.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per litre) has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by a cent at high fuel prices.
"The fuel tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert in traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most sensible option in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the federal state's ambitious, legally established climate change goals.
However, Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also delighted with the idea of letting drivers pay for their journey.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in a report in 2011 had asked Congress to move towards mile-based settlement.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of rural MPs who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 riders for the country's largest experiment, is the most committed.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could follow any of their movements.
"Concerning Big Brother and such things was a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Nevada Department of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance devices."
There was no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that the state can use to record the miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
This, Khan says, would also reassure the public.
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not start to help states with the taxation of motorists.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles driven.
But the devices tested by her are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made big mistakes.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average miles driven by all the residents of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a tax-paying device that can also pay parking fees, pay insurance only for miles driven, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time to help drivers avoid traffic jams.
"Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said that Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they too pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats well
The volunteer fire brigade did its autumn main test with flying colors despite a shortage of personnel.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Division commander Hans Kammerer had selected the estate Feder in Burgberger Straße in his exercise assumption.
There a short circuit is said to have been created during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two breathing protectors of the weir prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead him into the open.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow stairway to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw bales in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first fire attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made via an overfloor hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
During the exercise, Hans Kammerer also wanted to show what needs to be done with little staff available.
In case of emergency, support will be provided through the Königsfeld daily operation group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf also let himself be informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow come from.
In the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he investigated this important question together with the executive heads of the vocational schools as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the parents' advisory boards.
"Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thomas School, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the district grammar school and the vocational school centre in the Waldstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness in the county.
"It is important not only to look at the family phase, but also to look after the care of relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also pointed out that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor, is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies often retain the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the President of the Landtag.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
"Continue to remain stubborn and make public transport better," he explained to the local politicians present.
Enjoying an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then a vespers.
In the past, the elderly people were entertained in the rest area.
Meanwhile, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with common melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as a front delineation of the old school yard standing before the renovation to Kirchstraße is to be again included on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first works of the renovation of the front school yard, a small angular wall was installed to stabilize and relieve the static relief of the over one hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the state monument office is to be included in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be carried out by experts, which will then be put on the table by the municipal council to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two wings of the school built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of renovation must be renovated from the ground up and placed on a new substructure in the foreseeable future.
The historical wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, one hundred years old, is in need of renovation, especially due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, and has a bow inclination to the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which is done by the current fortification work.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was already planned in the years 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures brought a shift.
An important word in the historical reconstruction of the school wall, which has even been used for filming, will be the Landesdenkmalamt.
If specifications come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument conservationists.
The pupils of the Bräunlingen primary school, who are now taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also taken part in the ongoing discussions on the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up holistic education at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," said Özdemir the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the Jazz location Stuttgart.
Thus Özdemir, who is regarded as a favourite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, the latter is pushing for a reorganisation of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the study programme Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US border: "Super Tunnel" discovered to smuggle drugs
On the border between Mexico and the US, investigators discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
According to the U.S. customs authorities, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.
The tunnel had not been used, according to the data.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig under the radar," said U.S. District Attorney General Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Referring to the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was so equipped that electrically operated wagons could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened as a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, according to the press conference in San Diego.
It was the first time, however, that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities, not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug investigation in San Diego.
They'd do anything to get to the US.
No details were disclosed to the arrested, at least one being Mexicans, they said.
You have to expect prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger's festive year
The Jubilee of the City of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250th anniversary.
Return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in a good eight weeks, the anniversary year is due.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were mentioned together for the first time in 794.
In churches a document was made, in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen as well as in church houses.
Kirchen-Hausen will be the 1250 in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Come and celebrate again.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a celebration around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festive weekend is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
On the occasion of the anniversary, city music director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, 27 and 28 September.
A new chronicle will also be published on the occasion of the Geisinger Stadtjubiläum.
"It should not only be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today's Geisingen celebrates its birthday in 2014, in 1974 today's space was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on November 21st or 22nd in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Fools' Guild Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a tradition evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has a banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a document of donation, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which at that time was a court place.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly in 2014, in addition the municipal reform is also 40 years ago.
Council to target track installations
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the councillors have decided.
Schiltach has to take 220 000 euros into his hand for this.
The Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railway line in the coming year.
In particular, the safety at level crossings is to be increased - there are regularly collisions of trains with other vehicles nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must contribute one third of the costs, while the rest are shared by the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's mayor Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the "Am Hirschen" bah crossing.
There the city plans to build a bulge at the level of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, could also be on-board without having to block the tracks.
Greßhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp put the mood of the critics to the point with his statement: "Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transports.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition, Haas argued that the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed.
Since Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel had to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of the proposed widening of the road.
Despite this, the majority of people agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing with the condition that the necessary supporting wall is built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to around 5.5 meters if necessary for encounter traffic.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could cause a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the strongly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had had examined the conversion plans of the railway from the Breinlinger engineering office, because it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was then still possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be excluded that the inclinations of the road could lead to longer vehicles being mounted.
The city, in turn, bears the responsibility for this as a road load carrier.
The restructuring could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the removal of wood and the bending functioned in the current state of support, one should not agree to the conversion of the level crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, too, the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other level crossings, because there is the centre stop next to it, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be slowed down at this point to such an extent that no collision threatened.
In the majority of cases, approval was refused, since the city of Schiltach would have to "bathe out" the problem with on-board vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The committee considers the conversions at the level crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" to be unproblematic, for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been made.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far-off worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets in other stars.
Whether there are lives on at least some of them, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Should one look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or looking for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions that the European space agency Esa is asking itself.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make research a decisive step forward.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were under discussion, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Numerous committees examine the proposals, check with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme, initiated in 2007, are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to answer this question, the "Cheops" space telescope is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity will be investigated in greater detail.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
Using larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to indicate biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately provide information about the conditions for the emergence of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it plays an important role with the planetary system.
In our solar system these processes can be examined exemplarily.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved an M-Class mission (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa provides for the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Space offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what is it made of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the common matter, consisting of stars, planets and living beings like us, there are dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters together, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved an M mission here, the launch of which is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the selection procedure.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves, has the best chances of obtaining approval as an L mission.
This is what physicists mean by changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do this, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission includes a detector consisting of two or three probes stationed in space.
In contrast to installations on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves created by the Big Bang and thus provide new insights into the emergence of the cosmos.
Four other proposals still compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
Among other things, proposals have already been made for the return of samples from Mars, the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as solar physics.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US intelligence service, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify to the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a breach of loyalty and attempts to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no defence is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The prosecution filed by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by claims that the NSA has intercepted Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, Member of Parliament, who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said that the opportunity should be taken to hear Snowden as a witness if this was possible "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a member of the Green Party, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
When Snowden stated in Germany, he needed an assurance that he was "safe" there, the MEP said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he would be exposed to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had driven him out of his home country.
However, he was touched by the global response to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities 'when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved'.
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers who wish to stow hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for one piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if it was stated in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers could keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier stated that if the fee is paid in advance, 25 US dollars will be charged and 100 US dollars will be charged to passengers who only paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the fee of $100 is aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Airlines started charging fees for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to bypass these have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee wasn't really about making money.
It was about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who had clearly expressed that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a piece of luggage free of charge at Frontier's gate, but the next person will have to pay 100 dollars for a similar piece of baggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures were being changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the gate.
Frontier's new hand baggage charge only comes into effect in summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to use them.
They argue that the transportation of luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have so far left the finger of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand baggage three years ago, and later followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airliner.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the hand baggage charge would bring in US$50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand baggage charge.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest I've experienced in my aviation career," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and gripping discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding was running like lubricated."
Frontier also follows Spirit for the $2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought soda or juice could keep the whole can and refill coffee free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to charge for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed this seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had moved in.
Frontier's move to collect hand baggage fees if passengers don't buy directly from the airline is the recent initiative that aims to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company started to allocate half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were once again reduced to 25 percent of the flight distance.
A flight with Frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third party therefore only earns customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue decreased by 9 percent and flight capacity shrunk by just under 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report published by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republic has tried to control Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs From the Bible
More than 40 women attended the last women's breakfast this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish house were "speaking words from the Bible" and "speakings from the Middle Ages".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, responded to the biblical proverbs in a lecture.
"Words contain wisdom, precepts, or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding scriptures and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like, "Let the wooden eye be watchful, as scales fall from the eyes, and let an eye be drawn to someone whom the Lord gives in his sleep, and washes his hands in innocence."
Several times the speaker also told her listeners what the saying was.
The church councillor Christel Dehner took on the phrases of the Middle Ages: All good things are three, blue, a little banged.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges to the past".
Finally, a raffle was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously described before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for the unskilled in tourism
Today, a pilot project for the tourism industry is launched at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work in the industry as unskilled workers will be qualified as experts for hotels and restaurants over the course of three winters.
"What is new about this is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits were manifold: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would have trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA states that an "internal mistake" and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency stated late Friday that a mistake had crippled its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as has been claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the spy agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack was not true.
In the early evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and that it is still not available to some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman had told ABC News that the Authority's sensitive internal network was "in no way compromised".
According to the speaker, secret information is not in danger.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency, is now found in the bright light of the public and, following the revelations made in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad, is subjected to sharp criticism – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted Cyper operation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "but we had hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Head of Office at the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far reacted cautiously when it comes to recruitment.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We hardly have any skilled workers in the trade, in the health care and in the care of the elderly".
Since September, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been coming in again due to the seasons.
The winter season starts there in mid-December.
The entire background report can be found in the Allgäuer advertisement sheet of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Profit losses at Bombardier after decline in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decrease in net profit on Thursday after falling orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway division.
Nor did Bombardier, based in Montreal, publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could be commercialized in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago was followed by only three more take-offs, which makes it questionable whether the test phase will proceed as planned.
The results fell short of the forecasts and led to a price fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation from "outperform" to "sector perform" on Thursday in view of the fact that the share has a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker aircraft deliveries were expected to a large extent, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series will be able to catapult the company to the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, binding orders for the CSeries at 177 are moderate so far, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the Company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet airliner are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, management also assured analysts and media that the program was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected," said Beaudoin at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates had been scheduled during the aircraft's service life.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and then add a revision period, which we have done.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly after, it was said from the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical as to whether the first customer can take a CSeries aircraft into service twelve months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier stated that it is reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test – although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars, or 8 cents per share, of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share the previous year.
Adjusted earnings per share remain at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly, falling from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of 4.56 billion dollars, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer claims to have delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace sector amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September, unchanged from 31 December.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment rose by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order backlog in the transport sector on 30 September was 32.6 billion dollars, slightly higher than on 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to corporate management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share declined by 8.5 percent and amounted to 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette will join the board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Los Angeles Airport Shots
An unknown person fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at LAX airport.
While the airport management told Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama was constantly informed about the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses stated that they saw a shooter with a rifle in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people were in panic seeking protection.
Travelers would have screamed and children would have cried.
Panic had erupted among those waiting, many had hidden behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the security agency TSA had suffered a gunshot injury on the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
After that, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots were reported to have been fired near a security area.
Airport building evacuated
On TV pictures, numerous ambulances and police cars were shown in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken out of the building to safety.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special task force and a rifle lying on the ground.
According to the airport management, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were closed, resulting in long backlogs, according to CNN.
Except for landings, air traffic had been temporarily stopped, it said.
However, there were also several pilots on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" by criminalists, was arrested in his home in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta used Class A drugs regularly after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain illicit information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Crown Court of Liverpool after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted possession of cocaine in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out during their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs under the lawyer's garbage can with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it became known that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests of Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to the 'lawyer's secret'.
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he ran an office under his private address as well as at the workplace, and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was announced that he had called important actors in drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, "A criminal attorney should know better than anyone that you don't break the law."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender, as he has become too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these people.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered the police investigation as much as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus discredited his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any misconduct and claimed, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said, "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal lawyer to a criminal the moment he started buying drugs from organized criminals."
His addiction to cocaine led to hopeless compromise and made him sensitive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who asked him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also resulted in a conviction in three cases of possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of conspiracy to trade in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two divine services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which inspired the audience in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two divine services with the performance of the Deutsche Messe by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary Mass will be held from 19 on during the evening Mass in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. at the divine service in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The fair is performed as part of the divine services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism gives way to increasing confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, fundamental things will change, for example, in the pastoral unit Haslach (SE).
There is only one parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is nothing to change about the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new one hesitantly but increasingly gives way to a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals about the future composition and the size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six committees with the chief ministers of the pastoral care team ranged from.
On the basis of a presentation, regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach as a parish will in future form a body of public law, which will enter into the rights and duties of the so far six individual parishes.
There will be only one parish council and one foundation council in which the pastor Kraft is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, in the six parishes so-called community teams are formed locally.
Their task in the future will be to promote the Church's life in the place.
The question of the finances of the individual parish then showed considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes are preserved for specific purposes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the municipality as a whole.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then all parishes meet, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes have been invested", relativized Haslach's parish councillor Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the committee in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had set themselves the task of "Being One, Stay Five" in 2006 and had to find out that it was not so easy.
The committees of the Haslach Pastoral Unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the parish teams.
Further meetings will be organised and agreed at a further joint meeting of all six fora next spring.
In the end, the parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is becoming more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year for a family of four Prüllendorf.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is fixed annually in October by the four operators of the large power lines.
These figures measure the additional costs they incur from the energy transition, which they can levy through a surcharge on the electricity price.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform its customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, with the number more likely to be close to the 2 cent.
Traffic lights on permanent red: watch out for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
Then what do you do - drive in red?
If a affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is free, he can continue driving, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period had to be "adequate", which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises you to wait at least five minutes before the traffic light is expected to malfunction.
However, anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court Hamm.
In the case under negotiation, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped a little later to green.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Municipal Council welcomes sound budget
Whenever community council meetings are about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipality of Herdwangen-Schönach is well-filled and the administration no longer knows debts since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be recognised as a complete success.
This became clear when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was over EUR 1 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also about EUR 1 million higher than the figure at around EUR 1.8 million.
The surplus was mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipality's share of income tax.
The wealth budget was again clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As fewer investments were made in the 2012 financial year than planned, the addition of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like this out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the councillors were visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to forego high lifting rates in the past.
However, according to Gerster, this in turn has often reduced subsidies from the country.
There are prerequisites for these subsidies from various balancing poles.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain rates of increase.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, as investments are due in the coming years for which we would like subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermter's story at the men's singing club Cecilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was solemnly honored.
As usual, Hubert Wermter stood on stage in the colours of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the choir, which has become more than popular.
Wermter was also active in the club, including as a member of the committee for 28 years.
Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Officer on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him with a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst, since the choir is also a church choir.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German choir association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the award ceremony, the 31st autumn festival took place in the usual course: With the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singers' department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer invited a colourful mix of choirs and singing styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, her Brüder".
For their honoring singer Hubert Wermter they prepared a little ribbon - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choir songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "Wann du durchgehst durchs Tal".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "impulse choir" - provided the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir took the Neapolitan folk style "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the "impulse choir" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singer section of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home with "Was isch der Schwab?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories, which the children were busy at noon.
Children's Dreams Come True
The kindergartens and day nurseries in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wants to support the institutions in the realization of their building and beautification wishes.
Does kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day nurseries and crèches from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or beautification request for your facility, you can apply with it to the Schwarzwälder messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten building site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material of a maximum value of 2000 euros and on one (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide for many diligent construction workers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and should then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outrages controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and we may ask ourselves: what does Parliament not think about simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" was read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punishable and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we call on him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to The Star, the new law effectively strangles the media, while The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered "a severe blow" and called the draft "draconic".
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they published photos of security cameras showing how the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping mall.
Chief of Police David Kimaiyo responded with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate them, even if the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry.
According to the new law, media houses can be punished by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single penalty can bankrupt most radio stations."
In addition, the paper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's 'live blogosphere'.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in the nation who describes Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
"Leaving politicians to themselves, leading the country to bankruptcy and returning us to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already caused public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reinstated their substantial salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month – among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for FC
Despite the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose any of its importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had wished for a more pleasant ceremony last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play along.
So all those who came without an umbrella or couldn't hold such a thing for some reason had to look after them.
This was the case with the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as many speakers.
Therefore, the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, became wet.
His thanks went first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the participating companies and members of the association who contributed.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rustic pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the state parliament member Karl Rombach.
Further greetings spoke for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn hit the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee was considered.
Both have been discarded.
Six years ago, thoughts came up about the creation of an artificial turf sports ground, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning began two years ago when FC took over Schabelstube in Erbpacht, agreed to a €100,000 contribution for the construction of the square and approved the country's €104,000 funding.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros in the total cost of 560 000 euros, summarising Klumpp.
The construction of the 68 x 108 metre artificial grass field began on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of soil were removed, half of which was used for the installation of a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD continued their coalition negotiations on home affairs and justice.
To this end, the relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, member bribery and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
This is likely to involve, among other things, the issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting views.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its rejection of a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flatrate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive", explained the SPD negotiator on the subject of traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
Evasive traffic on country roads threatened, which were already the main focus of accidents.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from the point of view of Pronolds.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing föhnwelle on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be really summer again?" was actually not the question on Friday evening on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.

Drivers seriously injured in an accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old passenger car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on her way to Grefrath by car on the Kempen outer ring at around 9.15 p.m.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Toeniser Straße, she missed the oncoming car of the 37-year-old.
The driving fence collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Konstanz: Locking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left turn-off lane in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old driver behind the BMW was also damaged.
In total, some 15,000 property damage occurred, the police reported.
The road had to be closed during the accident, they continued.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will be no more announcements like this at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements fall away - the noise level is thus to be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of announcements concerning individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already refrain from the noisy calls.
The elimination of these announcements - on average around 200 personal calls by the loudspeakers in one day - should make things quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements were perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flights or departure times is lost here a bit," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car pulling with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1:30 p.m.
They have a Scottish tradition, but have a Swabian touch on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half metres long and weighs between 25 and 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't matter what the distance is," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown off vertically, should roll over once and then come straight to lying down.
This is rated with the most points.
When throwing horseshoes it depends on the target accuracy.
From a distance of eight metres, a stake is thrown.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by participants carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a vat are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team two can then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
You can already train from 10 o'clock.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the Scottish skirt.
But Swabian costume is also allowed.
For the "Outfit" the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish Swabian Highlander games and the tractor pumping, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action is already on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening the brass music friends get their money's worth.
At 7 p.m., the birabo-holy brass music from Schömberg will create the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fast polkas and marches.
Their repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as a singing host and black sausage baron, from Weilen, will be present.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Fools' Guild.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for the morning party, from 2 p.m. the Bauernkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then end the festival.
The start is already on Friday the Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf.
Other program items on Saturday and Sunday include the Oldtimer and Tug Meeting, exhibitions of companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the corn labyrinth, the artisans' market and sheep shears.
Specially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncing castle, tractor driving (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream, for example, is a quark substitute.
The Vegetarian Federation also mentions the World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, substitute yoghurt with soy yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Flapable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also herbal alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of apple must or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable.
Loosen are doughs instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of edible starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silk tofu can also serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany currently feed vegan, i.e. purely plant-like.
Sleepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of Schwarzwald-Gymnasium got to know the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we headed for Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which makes a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time difference, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city doesn't sleep", the day was decided in Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached on the second day by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then we went through the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11th.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the 373-meter-high viewing platform of the Empire State Building, while enjoying the view.
Afterwards, the hustle and bustle of New York's streets passed over the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a brief stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have arrived in their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
This year, too, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated on the name day of Saint Hubert in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
According to legend, St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter who converted through a vision and was later appointed bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhornbläsergruppe der Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) according to old, originally French melodies.
The brass wear riding clothes, because they primarily accompany riders, horses and dogs on tow hunts.
The solemn Mass will take place on Sunday, November 3rd, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to the encyclopedia, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve within sight of the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to remain the pure feeling of Déjà Vu.
After all, the café with its beautiful name has exactly this as its goal: to make an actual stay not only mental, but also tangible, always recurring.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at Opschlag 8 immediately gives the viewer a good feeling.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually filled fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the attractive café at Opschlag: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"We don't have a specific target group," emphasises Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here would like to address young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of café lovers.
The sympathetic owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew yourself in a variety of variations.
Expressofane
Daniel Büttner is more the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she reveals to the NRZ.
There were already two events in the bright café.
Actually, one thing.
Because the harbour festival took place outside - Café Déjà Vu did not profit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner isn't a fan of event evenings: "You can't make it right for everyone".
And with an event I always only address those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible".
In other words, Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thank you at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had gladly come.
In the club's restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence entirely in the sign of the music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is also always the right festivity to perform honors.
This time, the special award "Singer of the Year" pleased the secretary Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written down a lot for us, but you have also made many rounds for us, for which we thank you very much", says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went this year to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribber, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
==References====External links==* Official website
The board of directors especially thanked the team of club host Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had conjured up a menu of the extra class and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for his regular choral rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 pm in the club's restaurant.
"We are always welcome to hear new voices that are joyful in singing," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets for poverty reduction
The United Nations is now starting to develop a number of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals for Poverty Reduction announced twelve years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing "sustainable development goals" to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They have been included in the final draft of the document which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated at the summit that the time had come to "think beyond national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realise our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball Oberligisten continues to be in a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that at all.
Everyone is still fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"I don't even know how such a victory tastes anymore," Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-liga reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out any trees, Malmon raises the index finger in advance.
Many players I have still trained in the A-Youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also important to wait to see if there will be any reinforcements from the first," the SG coach explains.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous appearances.
Above all in the cover work and in the shift game, it had a huge impact.
The exploitation of opportunities also definitely needs to be improved.
So I hope that my players finally got their heads off during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to make peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the independence square of the capital.
For two weeks now, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
A lot is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA into the country over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
On Wednesday, he told AFP, the French news agency, that Dhlakama sees himself as a "loser" who "will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously," said Mazanga.
Earlier talks between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who hit their heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacities Renamo has, but she has carried out riotous attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port that mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga replied cautiously to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the frustration about the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country's future and that they should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life," says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthur legend demonstrated how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths were "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland argued for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that among authors and teachers who are "excessively didactic" children would be "completely shut down" because in entertaining stories the messages would be "sublime".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "One can pursue certain intentions, but one should keep them in the background if possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally represented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years came to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely entertaining scene play.
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, scriptwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining play, which received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time leaps from youth to approaching retirement.
On 22 October 1913 Hansjakob comes home to his children's heaven, to his Freihof.
And then began the scene play, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his role as the great son of the city.
Stilecht he drove with the two-spinner and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he received with much applause by the audience, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to get involved in the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected music pieces and thus rounded off the performance.
At the awarding of the honorary citizenship, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler was honoured, who, together with a part of the city council, was waiting for him on behalf of the then incumbent Hättich.
The three king singers who led Hansjakob to the exclamation made their wait: "Oh how beautiful, there again youth memories of my own three kings come alive".
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentagskinder with their loud "Out, Out".
At the time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the home earth, behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene play.
A lot of applause and many words of praise came from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants is growing
The chances of the league remaining of the sportingly descended Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
If there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project dispenses with an application for a possible return seat.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
However, a first breath of relief from Ludwigsburg was not to be heard.
"We didn't deal with the Wildcard procedure, so long as it wasn't clear that Düsseldorf won't get a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Up to 23 May, Düsseldorf Baskets will still be able to submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic potential for the Bundesliga.
Until now, however, the license has been denied to the Rhine countries twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Church of the Lord's Supper in the spotlight
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the cultural and tourism office is dedicating the last of this year's public themed tours to the Church of the Lord's Supper on Sunday, 27 October.
After visiting the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerloch period is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning conclusion is a visit to the Upper Supper Church.
There, the leaders get the story of the construction of the church told and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also looks at the painting of the Lord's Supper created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the other half-hour guided tour is at 3 pm at the Atomkeller Museum.
Tickets are available at the cash desk of the Atomkellermuseum.
For questions and information, the Haigerloch Tourist Office is available.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. military.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax Agency on the basis of unspecified circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally, it said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted their source.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatened extradition there, they continued.
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams fought for the title at the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end, the endurance of the team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
The tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
Five games per team were planned, each playing against each other.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the Wanderpokal to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
Second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team reached the bronze troupe.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful conclusion of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday programme, to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, the right thing for every age is there.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop is also used.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or gyres, the young guests can prove their craft skills.
Also the many old games, such as wheelbarrow racing or stilt running, promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 14 o'clock.
On an off-road tour, the children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or are still lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who will be doing his jokes with the museum guests from 11 o'clock.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner is enjoying a cosy and fairy tale.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o'clock.
In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broom binder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can look over their shoulders during their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday programme.

Brill beeping disturbs local residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the dump.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the camp site in front of the dike.
Two huge blue dump and return chargers distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every time the handling equipment moves, a shrill warning noise sounds across the terrain.
"The signals serve safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, this can be heard far from the wind - and so there were already some complaints from people from the city north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals were now being kept quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to focus on open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on the coal import for power plants and is one of the big ones in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 meter deep sink in front of the terminal, Capesize Bulkcarrier can also be handled here.
"This year we want to crack the 3 million-ton mark at the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, the imported coal goes to power plants in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant then goes to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayerns basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not reduce the huge optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe that we will also win against the best team in Europe in the past two years," said Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
During their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munich-based companies sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to turn a 15-point residue 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour, before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made reckless mistakes again," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of Munich, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays Innovation has been expanded, as it was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of Caroline's stand-up institution, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too well-known to perform in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year's event will feature performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians participating in the festival this year have become known through more unconventional ways, such as shows on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known for a sitcom on cable television (the ironic, slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on "Saturday Night Live" as well as on "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial themes W. Barlau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting takes place at Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in Larry's entire work's comedy DNA," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he's here, sometimes he goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks to himself, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here."
Iran Satisfied with Process of Nuclear Negotiations
Iran is pleased with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five United Nations veto powers and Germany.
"After years, an agreement had been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of the last few years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and was also optimistic that both sides would come to a solution in the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Killing Game Cam Wheels with Machete
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 - and 12 - year - old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
They would then have played football in front of their homes in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five - year - old half - sister of the younger one, who had taken her with her, should testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the crime in front of the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
Among other reasons, the elder mentioned a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric juvenile hospital.
Pimp must go to jail
For exploitative trafficking in human beings, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession in the course of a trial agreement.
According to this, he met women in five cases via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the streets after a few weeks against her will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He kept the income of the women, some of whom had been earning for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he placed contacts between women and the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their income.
In court, the defendant first claimed that he was suffering a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about the psychological limitation and thus a limited ability to blame, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to question any of the women who were harmed.
A police officer reported that at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking could be identified after an initial notification by telephone surveillance measures.
The intercepted conversations were characterized by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another Witness, in whom one of the women had found bruises all over her body, had not made any statement to this day.
It was "a completely broken personality" who regarded violence and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has detached himself from these circles and wants to lead a normal life after detention," he said.
Oil price continues to decline up to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil grade for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel in Europe in the late morning in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price fall of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there were indications of stronger demand from two reports of activity growth in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, with growth rising to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude oil, a reference value for international crude oil also used by US refineries, fell by 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks NYPD's stop-and-frisk decision
On Thursday, a federal appeals court in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had called for changes to the stop-and-frisk program ("seeking and searching") of the New York police department, and released the judge from the case.
The Second U.S. Court of Appeal declared that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions were suspended until a decision was taken on an appeal by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city was in violation of the Constitution with the way in which the program for stopping and questioning people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring centre to assist the police in amending their directive and the corresponding training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality, partly due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they inadequately targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot programme of body-worn cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons released after police control.
An oral hearing on the city's appeal is planned after 14 March 2014.
Stop-and-Frisk tactics have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
Controls of this kind have existed for decades in various forms, but the number of recorded controls increased during the term of the non-party mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, who belonged to all minorities, filed a lawsuit that developed into a class action.
Proponents of NYPD's stop-and-frisk program change say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as influence the way other police bureaus use the regime.
Opponents believe that the changes will dampen the morale of the police, but not crime; money will also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after thousands of jobs have been lost in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD implemented the controls.
The Happiness of the Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the deployments were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Bundesgrenzschutzfahrzeug.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning, according to Henne, to work with the association in an advisory capacity.
In 2008, the Schleeh carpentry company from Baiersbronn created the sickbay in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of almost a week.
Hen also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the maternity clinic in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
One learns a lot in Africa as a doctor, says hen, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, one could not make as many trips as planned, but for this many doctors came to Germany to listen in different areas.
In addition, containers of material are regularly sent to Africa, including medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local colour by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into mobile goat stables and describing the experiences of the musicians from Stammheim who traditionally support the association during their trip to Mauritania.
As his personal motivation, he mentioned his work in the field of auditing as a young MP.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he had decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also demands global love for people.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Secretary of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey Court that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper asked private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and tracked them, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
"According to the prosecutor's office, Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, is no one standing in front of people's homes and hoping to catch them in the act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories in an investigative way: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, it can't be otherwise.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors about Clarke's affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editor when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone on at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
During the research, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to publish tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Blunkett for an affair with a married woman when he himself had been dating the co-indicted Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned Reich tax, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends inconclusively.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of associations and associations at the Paris Élysée-Palast on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, announced Jean-Pierre Louvel, Chief Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF).
The games in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 scheduled between 29 November and 2 December are therefore out of date.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the Gemeindehalle to be explained the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring in ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The flood, which struck Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009, was a major event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, according to Häussler.
A river basin survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The aim is to protect as many built-up plots as possible," says Häussler.
According to the German Weather Service, the planning of the protection against a flood that can be expected every 100 years is based on statistics.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent increase.
In professional circles this is referred to as "HQ 100aClimate".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häussler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aclimate, about four million euros have to be invested in gechingen, whereby the municipality can expect state subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Häussler pointed out that funding would only exist if an overall approach was implemented.
The municipality is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case scenario, implementation could start in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer Tal.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why more dams and retention basins were not planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal.
In addition, one is obliged to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
There was displeasure among residents of the old town, who have to suffer again and again from an overload of the canal network even in normal thunderstorm rains.
The problem is known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häussler pointed out that the directives for canal systems were different from those for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two to three years of rain events can be endured.
To dimension the sewers larger would devour millions.
Severely injured after collision
On early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could say little about the accident.
However, there were various testimonies that were to be evaluated.
It is certain that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so heavily trapped that it took the fire department less than half an hour to get her out of the wreck.
The actual cause of the accident initially remained unexplained.
Both victims came to nearby hospitals.
The track remained closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostoyevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Astonishingly the relationship in the exterior: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who has something in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with its 118 stories distributes two thousand ones.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security madness and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences; his late books read themselves like a mixture of John's revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator of his creature.
That's the Blade Runner problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" dates from 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
The principle of "pre-crime" is being developed here, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles ours horribly, mutants look to the future - and the police intervene.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the agency.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And, "There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a penitentiary full of pesudo-criminals."
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal thought from being put into practice.
Dick's story looks like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA's interception rush.
Anticipating the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice also works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the controller himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system's freaking out.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Takes not only mistakes and sacrifices into purchase, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Spokesperson around Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. affairs surrounding Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Attorney's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Before that, the Green MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Interior Intelligence Service, he was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas, and the action led to an exchange of words between the USA and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the US did not use opportunities for foreign espionage "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profit."
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower, began publishing his cornucopia of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure they can take the director at their word.
Reports of the US National Security Agency spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtaining data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company's paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The leaking of Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone bugged, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management is certainly also a potential target.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITTi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now represented almost as much a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consultant company EY.
However, in the documents leaked by Snowden, there has been no evidence that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of the US espionage agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction and is potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, about ten percent of non-U.S.-based members rejected plans to use an American provider after revelations about US data mining activities with Prism.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't exist a year ago – it says: where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage takes place is no surprise.
That's always been the case.
"It has been an issue for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial level, just as we are, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business management usually does not brag about the countermeasures that have been taken, as this gives the attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or leaving a laptop unguarded in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board at Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting, so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access," warns the BAT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, France, Russia, and Israel were ranked second behind China in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The secret services know very well that even if they cooperate in the fight against terror, all countries spy on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, how at least the wedding party succeeds, gave now a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important providers were represented around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has returned.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the dresses, often boasted and embroidered, are closed, often with a veil, at the back they go down the back and often end up in a train.
However, as Stefanie Koch of the fashion house Kleidermüller emphasizes, the spirits separate.
For men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The important thing is the selection of the restaurant, was explained.
Jewelryless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the Remise.
If you then want to drive up with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for him.
"Coaching is also popular for june parties," he says.
Romance is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
Elisabeth Keidel explained that the "after wedding photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - thus shooting series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding board, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successful
Once again, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured fifth place, and with the 15 month old Marley he finished with 87 points in 12th place.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in class 1, faced the critical eyes of the judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teenager's parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestler mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, explained the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat behind the grandstand in the school gym.
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the 17-year-old's family doubted.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson's lawyer, to FoxNews.com.
They never thought he died the way the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that it is without logic, that it violates the laws of physics as well as common sense," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in a body bag," he comments.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death a crime?
That's what Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of "position-related suffocation".
However, a second autopsy revealed another cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Department was not ready to comment immediately upon our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities have to release all surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained clues as to how he died.
CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government as the number of school-aged children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who have allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have in stock epinephrine – the Auto-Injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used – to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislators have recently amended the rules to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels as if something is pressing on my tongue", "My tongue feels as if a hair is lying on it" or "My tongue is tingling".
Parents of intersexual children can choose "gender indeterminate"
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third sex for children born with indiscriminate genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can indicate 'indeterminate' or 'undefined' on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding sex assignment operations in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person said years later: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and scarred.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children are born every year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group that is diagnosed with "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. suggest that the best available information on gender assignment should be used if a determination is not possible, rather than waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if at all – for surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds after a good cause".
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not," he said.
One could make a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child actually develops his or her sexual identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexuals are to be distinguished from transsexuals or transgenders, because their status is not gender-related, but is determined by their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female exclusively, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were found in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination suffered by intersexual and transgender people in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or 'third sex' on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the first "genderless" person in the world after a court had granted life-long retention of "undefined" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third allocation, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, arguing: "If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we are twisting two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a sex at birth.
"Parents are already stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said to the parents' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Just ten years ago, medicine viewed sex as something that could be extinguished and then rebuilt.
However, the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned, now that it is known how complex gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex they have assigned.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a 'psychiatric emergency'," said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with indiscriminate genitalia is based on Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable.
He coined the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental impulses – such as how parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and thus shaped whether a person considers himself male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed during a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation, but it was not," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he changed back to the male sex and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations came to the public, who are "not happy with the result".
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he was to receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him barren.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project to ensure that intersexuals are perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law can "encourage stamping and stigmatisation".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child a 'undefined'," she said.
We fear that this favours intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know how the law will affect us, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this point in time.
When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorizes" both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz's daughter, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in children's psychiatry.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have a child through adoption or surrogate motherhood.
"The law gives parents room, so they don't have to make quick decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write 'male' or 'female'.
In this way everything is in order – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can't be undone.
"This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they think they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that's wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decisions.
Unknowns hurt girls by shot from car
Unknown people have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in shots fired from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired an air-pressure gun on a group of children in Genthin on Thursday night.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left calf.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disk broke.
Then they drove away.
The detectives were investigating it on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to ejecting children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the owners of the house recognized this in good time and removed the eggs immediately, no damage to property could have occurred.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller were also ignited in the city area, but no damage to property was also caused here.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel trims were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man has found all his wheel-dressing blinds in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to continue to act.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new place for my husband and me for some time now.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the worry, that in old age the many steps to the house and in the apartment can no longer cope, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties woman has had to experience on her own what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
Recently a book of her has been published on the topic 'Happy Living in Age - Which Housing Is the Best for Me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age', she begins to tell.
When she moved to the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Today, Waltraud Ries thinks differently with his mid-fifty.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most of them displace it as long as they can.
Only the others get old,' she says, smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great, do you think about it.
'But then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 residential models for self-determined living in old age.
'What type of housing you choose, however, is always an individual decision', she explains.
The solution was not for old age.
Even those who can afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also become ill.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language one can also unite in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author gives to those who want to relocate.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often quoted pensioner's apartment.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and quirks
"For me such a shared apartment would be nothing," she says with a wink.
Especially not like in a student flat with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'When you're old, you just need your retreats, too,' says Ries.
Nevertheless, the book author does not want to exclude the fact that a senior citizen living together can still work.
But then this had to be different than in the classic student-WG.
And sometimes you just want your peace,' she believes.
With this opinion, at least in the state capital, she is not alone.
'Most of the old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the Bürgerservice Leben im Alter der Landeshauptstadt.
Your department advises people on the topic of getting older.
Therefore, especially older people would often also accept inconveniences and restrictions, only in order to be able to stay in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the age-appropriate conversion of their house or apartment, first of all, inform themselves thoroughly and not commission the firstest craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat lift, the interior designer explains.
But the existing apartment cannot always be remodeled according to age and thus barrier-free, even if it is so beautiful.
This was the experience Waltraud Ries had to make.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the path paved with stairs up to the apartment door would be the far bigger obstacle.
She'll keep looking until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she's more scared than the spider at her apartment door.
USA wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its attitude towards former U.S. intelligence agent Edward Snowden.
He was further accused of having disclosed illicitly secret information.
As a result, he has to face criminal proceedings in the US, said U.S. State Department spokesperson Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent statements would not change that.
Before that, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, had appealed to the US not to further threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele's statements were those of a parliamentarian and not of a German member of the government.
Secret service unveiler Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee, who was wanted by the USA, in an unaddressed letter that Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
According to a translation distributed by Ströbele, the text of the letter is as follows:
To the responsible parties
I've been asked to write you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear, while the risks that have been taken have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
Nevertheless, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this negative attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate adequately and legally in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to having a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private person.
The sale was approved by the municipal council at its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," emphasizes Maier.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, such as heating, looking at the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Place Concert at High Summer Temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
As conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the baton at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The president Manuela Honeck presented the music pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first musician's shock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to The New York Times.
The unveiling is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book, and on Thursday night, she reported that the president's top advisors had conducted "extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011" to find out if it would look better for Obama's dwindling hope of re-election if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Policy Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the campaign's and White House's efforts, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on poll scores of replacing former Secretary of State Clinton with Vice President Clinton.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader of Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisors, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
"Double Down" claims that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite their "close personal relationship" before finally deciding against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible polls at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley described the investigations as 'obliged care', Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that significant efforts had been made during the campaign to re-election to find out whether such a move paid off in terms of ballot boxes.
"Campaigns don't spend so much money on surveys and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was "conscious," the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama had not known about the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the elections.
"Possible," Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
In the design of the Internet service, has e-mail been technically implemented in the same way as conventional mail?
The design of early Internet services focused on making communication possible.
Therefore, in the basic technical protocols, care has not been taken to create a stable foundation for a sound-proof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
When user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call his provider for the content.
Are conventional e-mails read along their way through the network?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way.
The provider of the sender usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have yet another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability of unauthorized persons reading an e-mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement agencies and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying activities.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against co-reading.
It is also possible to mask the metadata of an e-mail communication with a high level of technical effort, so that it is not even easy to identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a August 2013 study by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While Yahoo-Mail's shares had last fallen, GMail was able to increase significantly from Google.
Mother buried in the forest and pension collected
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care money.
In order to be able to continue collecting pension and care allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations.
At first, he covered up the death of the 89-year-olds, then he took the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
According to this, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time it was noticeable that no more medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It came out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and that he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old had finally acknowledged the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime.
Want some ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing ice cream in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a glowing treat.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists to make the glowing protein artificially.
When consumed, the ice cream reacts with the tongue, raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shines – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But that's what it tastes good for.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is in itself impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League after six days of play.
Now, for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow, the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend, is coming.
With this game, the season begins anew for us.
"I hope that we finally have our heads clear," says Ehlers, who is cautiously optimistic.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his entire squad at his disposal.
Daverden, too, like us, relies on speed play.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase the coverage, which has left anything but a safe impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's not why we're the favorite, because in Derby, everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to go back to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
Joost Windßuß, who is active at the A-Jugend-Bundesliga HC Bremen with doubles rights, is celebrating his season debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I have become more of a Halloween muffel.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I am not going to do so again this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the US Retail Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion US dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft punk spacemen will make it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We disguised our dogs last year and were not alone with it to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars on costumes for their pets this year, says the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
As far as candy is concerned, we're not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of candy bars, lollipops, candies and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who move through the neighborhood with the slogan "sweet or treat".
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not pretend – eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is sugar sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't solved yet.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that generate $500 million in revenue, America Haunts says, and that includes the wonderful photos where you pee in your pants and then put your friends on Facebook where you don't get rid of them again, and then the guy you're standing on leaves a comment like "nice face expression."
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from the very beginning.
Fortunately, the "baby in pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the front yard, is probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.

Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue workers hide charred corpse
The fire brigade had to move out in Helmbrechts late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night.
The rescue personnel are picking up a charred body from the house.
Rescuers found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already beating out a window.
The operatives went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building was no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest regional church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor’s profession.
Background is a possible lack of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in a conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine yourself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche for the first time commissioned a pastor on a full job to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien refers this to the process of de-churchization: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and I can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be close to the people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live on it well.
Certainly more is being paid in the free economy, but theologians have a safe employer for that.
This is a response to the young people of today who are concerned not only with careers but also with meaningful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of theology begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could be difficult to fill posts in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become President of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior features racing seats and six-point harness as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from bowler-work mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the rigour and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day in February at the Defender Challenge as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firemen called for the rescue of a puppy who was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky outcrop in a quarry
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her predicament
Firefighters beat themselves to the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The fire department managed to secure a puppy that was stuck in a rock wall on a 15 - metre - high ledge.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who owns the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby again and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and published cries for help on social networks when she ran into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker who led his dog saw Ruby stranded on the 15 meter high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the site and roped away to rescue Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move any muscle during her rescue – she was frozen like stiff.
But now she's fine.
She ate some dog pies afterwards.
That was a pretty unusual assignment.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby was very lucky."
There was the possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination but did not detect anything except fatigue and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her back in your arms.
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added, "We were afraid she would fall, but she stayed upstairs."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker and that "he hit me when I was 18".
She added, "That was a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he has ever attempted to approach Katy Perry."
The representative added: 'Maybe she confused him with someone else.'
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones Tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed at first place this week.
George Kerevan: European Unbundling Gives Scots the Choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire-backed border along the Hadrianswall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not play a role in the headlines, as expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
As Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, continuing non-respect for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
Actually, it's not a story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance according to the European whistle?
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
That is the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project has officially died.
Across the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to win almost five million votes in the September Bundestag election and effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket, which is forced on the national economy by sticking to the single currency, many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe has a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the Brussels "green" energy directives – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage fixings in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, there is a revolt, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimation and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, with which the struggling French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive by-election and thus placed the ruling socialists in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically bring benefits to the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something more like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) nations' that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold onto the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of being flattered by the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be in the Atlantic rain alone.
Where is Scotland with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (finally) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can put themselves where.
I suspect that Scotland could do quite well in a looser European network, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar thinking countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same thing to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and implemented) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to get austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Grow up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the Pediatrics Association of American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually this is not an indication that puberty is now rapidly on the rise," Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hairs, and body odor, are evident in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarchs (the first period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it will take at least two to three years to reach the menarch," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is "flickeif" when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth boost before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
In case of rapid progress, tests by an endicronologist may be indicated so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and the defence against another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age companions."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how to handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter got her days at the age of ten.
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are the cause.
Boys get into puberty similar to girls in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys are growing facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards full-blown previous puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is even common in babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to speak to their child.
"This can mean having a conversation sooner than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders
Between leading aircraft manufacturers there has been a dispute over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, which sets the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always the ones that airlines strive for the most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
This week, Airbus demanded an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US-American archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is decisive for the economic results that the new "mini-jumbo" design is expected to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized 777X will hold 406 people in tourist class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the start of a new advertising war and showed lenders a picture of three people sitting in a restaurant squeezed together, with the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turboprops," says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
People are getting fatter in the face of changed eating habits, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to data from the US Department of Health.
According to US health statistics, the waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a seating concept from the 1950s when the average body circumference of the newly baptized jet set was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out which show that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus' numbers on seat dimensions and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines balance fares and equipment.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
"It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," explains Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow-free, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the fight is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion after list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results partly depend on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row for existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper fares.
"Eightteen inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offering is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, cabin furniture expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-travelling jet sellers even carry tape dimensions with them to measure the equipment in the competition.
Even if they advertise comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not sold one according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of greater cabin adaptability and offered wide seats on the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to blow, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could put an end to the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before testing on humans, further trials are needed, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop using all the methods available on the market, but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents a smoker from experiencing a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a "time-out", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the scientific journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, turning liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if certain, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use it to stop.
"They then know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it anymore because of the nicotine vaccine, and this will help them to quit the habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former minister of the Labor Party, Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, is being investigated by state corruption supervision.
The former NSW Minister denies that he has changed the rules on leased property at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings in three land plots on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigations into whether Obeid had influenced various ministers of state to extend leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without a call for tenders after their expiry in August 2005.
Now they are investigating the accusation that Tripodi had known of Obeids' hidden interest in the properties after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole had testified accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had urged public tenders for leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer maturities.
In 2009, the leases for the Circular Quay companies, which earned $2.5 million annually to the Obeids, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally advocated public tenders.
However, he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged a change in the government’s lease arrangements.
A telephone record submitted to ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Ministry of Port after working under Obeid at the Fisheries Authority.
Mr Anthony Wheaty Tripodi, Vice-President of the Commission, asked: 'Was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial leasing arrangements?'
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was being discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighter planes attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to 'genuine testing'
The government is considering a 'genuine test' for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used via a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was published today, after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as an insult by Australia's neighbors.
"Speaking statements such as 'foreigners should be in the back' and 'Australians first' are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions were demanding a sheltered labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region received an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The proposed discussion outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the 'genuine criterion' is adopted, a person applying for a visa could be checked to see whether 'the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally associated with the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking'.
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The troubled nine - year - old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father’s death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study has been announced by the UK Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England be established as early as the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
In the name of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unmistakably" campaign for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail connection has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian flight passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode".
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian companies are observing the decision that US airlines have to do tons of work to implement, but are not pursuing immediate plans to amend their regulations.
The CASA also stated that it would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
"CASA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft", it was announced.
The subject is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already had discussions with CASA about extending the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and says that people are open to change, but these must be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome CASA's review of the certification of electronic devices, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a speaker.
Qantas said that they would remain with the current regulations until further notice.
"Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices may not be used at take-off and landing, and we do not have any plans to change that at the moment," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of the decision on US companies varies according to the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate mobile radio interference and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer training.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases with poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stowed safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats at take-off and landing.
In front of the precinct derby against Schalke, fellow BVB supporters with flares had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before the Bundesliga's Friday match against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustic that offered itself to the viewer in Signal Iduna Park just before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German runner-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart.
Most of the guests were heard with their songs.
The south grandstand, on the other hand, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quiet: no songs, no battle calls.
The platform of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint cheering, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the grandstand a large flag with the inscription "Section Stadium Ban" blew alone.
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always was the first BVB player to enter the course, short-term cheers started.
When his teammates followed, there were loud singing and waving scarves - but not everywhere.
There was no movement in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grandstand.
The fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a celebration mood.
Only five minutes before the whistle, the Capo climbed its podium - and the tension, which had been almost tangible with hands, was released in a loud scream when Dickel asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium as usual.
As always, it was the turn of the south grandstand - and finally the loudest place in the stadium was here again as usual.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derbysieger gets up" came with the start from the south grandstand, everything was again as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Right in front of the regional derby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired flares into the audience and onto the pitch - and almost scored goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was whistled late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fans representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," announced the BVB boss at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned Ultras from playing a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I didn't do that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"That's going to be a big deal," assured Watzke.
You can be curious how the reactions on the south grandstand will turn out.
Pawnshops are booming in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings in a pawnshop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore to pay her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I have just bought a house where all my money is in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative employee and her husband also works, she explains that the monthly family income is not sufficient.
Indeed, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pledgeing jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore require an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent required by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
Pawnshops, however, offer the advantage that no verification of creditworthiness or proof of income is required, which is why loans are possible faster than at banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pawnshops after families feel pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in developed economies, families with lower and middle incomes are looking for pawnshops to compensate for the difference in the stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's described growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the Agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has just come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that, in view of rising costs, people in the middle to the lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the last two years have reinforced the trend towards pawning personal items, as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the 200 pawnshops of the city state are gold.
People say to themselves, "The price of gold looks good, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and get it back next month."
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent increase in customers in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only have more favorable interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own, and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household training," she explains.
The pawn lending business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pawnshops are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax's stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
"This includes wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies that need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Edward Snowden, a secret service unveiler, has a fundamental interest in helping Germany clarify the increasingly explosive NSA spy.
Following the presentation of the Green Party member Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-secret service employee would testify to a German prosecutor's office or to an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the bailout package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided upon after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for electoral services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and grey star treatments, are to be carried out to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after inpatient stays, specialist training, services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that hospital staff affected me have said are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if "they were not accompanied by genuine reforms that would bring the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for having responded to his request for urgent aid, which he had first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state's public health system from the list of concerns," Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these electoral achievements will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
However, Peter Dutton, the health spokesman for the opposition at federal level, believes that today's announcement is only a "paved solution".
"We are in today's situation because the Labor State Government has deducted 430 million dollars from the healthcare system," he told ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government rips almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretends that it's good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also heavier than necessary.
The story, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the moving story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination with another.
The film never slips into lust or sensation – and that's where its problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tormented penitent shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, says a surveillance group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gunfire ammunition facilities, the global chemical weapons surveillance group said on Thursday, while in the north of the country there have been serious clashes near one of the sites where toxic substances are suspected to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed almost three years ago since the start of the civil war.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date of
1 November, which the Damascus-based organization, based in The Hague, had set up to destroy or make 'inoperable' all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machines for the mixing of chemicals into toxic gas and for the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still needs to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
It is believed that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, experts saying there was a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities, as reported by the UK-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory.
The activist group, which is tracking the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 are government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting against the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said that there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not give any details.
The fighting underscores the danger posed by chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is "now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has witnessed their destruction."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to safety concerns the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "disbanded ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program there had been relocated to other aforementioned facilities which had been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I am wary of the bravery and courage shown by all of you in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, to which many Alawites belong, to split Shia Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there had been a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger over judgment for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted indignantly to the verdict for the last of the instigators who were brought to justice, because Umar Patek was supposed to be shot in a stand-up manner.
Patek, who was one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia on the run for almost ten years, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the construction of explosive devices for the bombing.
With parole, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A guilty verdict was also issued in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomb maker, is also referred to as "Demolition Man".
The decision has awakened painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when, on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
To keep him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting many hundreds isn't much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was finally picked up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reestablishing the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on others.
The verdict was issued before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is being held with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have cell phone calls)
From departure to landing, air travellers can now use their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, listening to music and watching movies, but not using mobile phones, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference how quickly they would be implemented, depending on the respective airline.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and the arrangements for storing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not allowed to take them off again until the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the approach, passengers must switch them off again and must not take them off again until the aeroplane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment also at take-off, landing and on the runway, the FAA explained.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Association of Professional Flight Crews, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
To be honest, we are sorry to have to feel like caretakers on this issue.
However, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data less than three kilometres remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines in public because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Phone calls during the flight are also still prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA, has the regulatory competence for telephone calls.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board said national traffic safety expert on CBS News said mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause malfunctions in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also disrupt transmission poles," Rosenker said.
A industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri argue that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies talk of up to a third of passengers forgetting or ignoring the switch off of the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers in 1966, after reports of malfunctions of navigation and communication devices by passenger-carrying FM radios, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that they do not care about electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers for several years when the altitude is reached.
The pilots adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when flipping.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the interference with the equipment was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports of pilots arguing for aircraft systems being disrupted by the equipment, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange the switching off of the equipment by passengers in poor visibility during instrument landing.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adaptation for travellers who today would be equipped with extensive technology.
"We are pleased that FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued from North Sea Drill Island by air rescue service
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The water race was flown last month by helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was fed by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This waterline was probably a winter migration bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling rig.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When she was released, the waterline was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite willing to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they think of the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business executives, representing roughly the UK's business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while the EU states are stagnating.
They want new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be favored by the government rather than the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
In their view, the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be restored to Westminster on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust to product legislation.
There was general discontent about the internal market, as, according to companies, the cost of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with those who are traditionally the most Europe-friendly.
After all, and probably most of all, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This insight, which is found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pressing for a "sensuous change" that brings the issue of action back to the UK.
There is a lot at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show, which means greater attention to trade for companies and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria was the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom board.
"Today's event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes across Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be heard from official sources.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other downstream countries is expected to start on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location in Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the funding possibilities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th Real Estate Day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in comparison with Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out on the 9th Real Estate Day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
According to Ulbrich, the view of the transaction volume shows how German commercial properties are wanted.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period of the previous year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive return," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with child sex offences before charges were brought against child caregiver Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission for the Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, in the opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA had stated that "the organisation had never had anything to do with an incident of sexual child abuse".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another in which one sports teacher from YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 of abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers, that he had known about the first case but had not known the second.
He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that "there had been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety".
On the contrary, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started with the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the management had failed "from me down" in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines.
At the beginning of the year, Lord had been convicted of sexual offenses against twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that had prevented employees from reporting Lord's child safety violations.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for her privately as a babysitter, let her sit on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and let children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, stated that the head of child service, Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's superior at YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable."
The managing director said he would not accept statements from employees that they did not dare to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, which was why they had not reported him.
Hare stated that he had informed the YMCA NSW Board of his view that the lesson the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was not "reporting" by employees and that the Board had agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations were made was taken by the YMCA's Managing Director of Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this was to prevent contamination of the evidence, but this had been 'overzealous' and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children during the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert in sexual child abuse, to the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in hiring, checking, training, and supervising staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic political issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided expressing his views on British politics, and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked if he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horse show experts found themselves in droves in Cardiff to choose the horse of the year, they were aware that a fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee trod loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put on his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which were far above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field and left the field with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was electrified and everyone cheered him up and clapped him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
Just as it started, it won't be long before it's on the Horse of the Year show – and I'm sure it'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The jurors then assessed Fenton and Toffee how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the show ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes contributed their part to this, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper that demanded the release of a reporter charged with defamation on the front page was to be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on TV that he had taken bribes to forge reports about a sub-state company.
The new express will now be subject to "comprehensive rectification", the regulatory authority said.
The "rectification order" was issued by the Office of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports about the publicly listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that they had decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter's license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to complete the rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant persons in charge of the New Express and immediately review the management team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized that I was doing the wrong thing.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and stated that they had failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a law change at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnels discovered with their own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would have ever found.
The tunnel, which zigzags over a length of just under six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported undetected in it, the authorities explained.
According to the court’s records, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been recovered when the tunnel was discovered.
According to the authorities, three men who worked as drivers were charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened with prison sentences of between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which poses the challenge for drug cartels to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 640-meter-long passageway with rails running from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
However, in an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has commented on the separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, who was scheduled to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly the way we plan or hope."
Kerr and himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom are married since 2010, in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
Veganism, according to the encyclopedia, is subject to vegetarianism, but differs considerably from it.
While vegetarians allow themselves the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edamer, these feasts are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the absence of meat and fish, the vegan refrains from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains may be asked, but on closer inspection the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
The native of New Zealand has been living vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but also because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers synthetic leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
Primarily, being vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," Proctor expresses the maxim of vegans, which extends to the entire consumption behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan is not a waiver, not an asceticism, but an enrichment."The assumption that you reduce the choice of food options with the dietary change is more likely to lead Proctor back to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that made some of the still well-meaning attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a crucial factor that makes many people give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor compares.
And he says, "Some tastes are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should certainly taste hearty.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but that's not just to reduce to animal food," Proctor says.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he had not suffered.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I don't take foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood tests are excellent, I often get checked," Proctor reveals.
Many vegans warn of the lack of vitamin B12 in particular.
"Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the freezer," says Proctor.
Vegans would also have the opportunity to consume the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor did not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, there are staple foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need on site.
I just buy something special from time to time.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is what is known to be the case with "ordinary" finished products."
In any event, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than was commonly assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the house kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake, Proctor was also able to surprise his in-laws.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he has already been skeptical.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - with such questions one has to act as a vegan with sensitivity.
"I do not reject people, I am part of this society," Proctor does not want to put an end to the enclave.
And more closely considered, the everyday world doesn't seem as vegan as it was supposed - and the vegan doesn't seem as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There's fries everywhere!
"Many donner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he avoids pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are starting to adjust to it.
"When I started to eat vegans 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If there are enough demands, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they're the opposite of exclusive.
"Meal dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the biggest part impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially if one learns to understand that also in peanuts animal additives can contain as color giver, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are buried in food and cleaning products.
"One gradually develops a scanner view and knows which characters and logos one has to pay attention to "It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or trip," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it's an important moral finger that hits the consciousness.
He may not quite succeed in abandoning his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
The trade at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon in German time.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of minor and major failures on the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for an hour because of errors in data transport.
In August of this year there had been two breakdowns in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock market operators needed almost a whole day to review and cancel the orders.
Two days later, half of the entire stock trading in the US was stopped for several hours due to a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Last year, Facebook's IPO also caused a stir.
The Nasdaq systems had not been up to the tide of buying and selling orders, later the SEC found and thundered the company to a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Konstanz: Bikers ride around 63-year-olds
According to the police, the accident had occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, at around 10 p.m., was on the left sidewalk from Bahnhofplatz towards Marktstätte with a ladies' bicycle.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped from a restaurant on the sidewalk, the bicycle driver could no longer brake in time, according to the police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the floor in the further course and pulled a 15 cm long place wound to the head.
An ambulance team took the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police issue extradition notice to Assange
The British police today handed over an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had been served with a "call to turn himself in" which required him to appear in a police station and added that if he did not comply, he would be threatened with arrest.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences, after his possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the US, he had sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and had asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had "committed a request to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time we had chosen," said a spokesman.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible charges of espionage after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks unveiling website.
Driver, who raced between his legs with 210 km/h and hot drink, receives 1,000 pounds penalty
A driver was charged a penalty of £1,000 because he had driven at up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester District Court, Howie pleaded guilty without taking the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 and a £100 sacrifice supplement.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a 7 % stamp tax in the 2012 budget on apartments costing more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers holding apartments as a company rather than as individuals.
Already, the revenue from the stamp duty on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012/13 fiscal year, exceeds the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: "Following the increases in the stamp duty on high-priced housing and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-quality real estate is taxed too low, regardless of the effects of the outdated community tax system."
"But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in London, or discourage owners from selling it," he added.
Top-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the prosperous south-west of London, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging domestic market where the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between a dog’s tail waving and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail swung more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "It is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noticed that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail waving of their fellows, the researchers monitored the animals while watching other dogs' films.
They measured the heart rate of the quadrupeds and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the tail moves in one direction or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog waving), her heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not communicate intentionally with each other through these movements.
He is rather convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience, which movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and if you are more connected with friendly behavior in one direction with the tail and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the University of Bristol's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said that this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a happy dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria in Canada stated: “Dogs tend to approach a robot dog when its ‘tail’ is waving left and not right, rather than getting restless – just the opposite of the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could be caused by the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw said.
But since their behavior is easy to record, it probably won't take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turners
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer has developed larynx infection.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play at the Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be moved.
The band's announcement came after she had previously had to postpone a gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with larynx inflammation, which is why it cannot occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, which was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience caused by this.
Please contact the customer service at the points of sale where you bought your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis appoints first Cardinals in February
Pope Francis was to appoint new Cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer take part in the papal election – this belongs to a group of 120 "cardinals entitled to vote".
In a statement in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, was held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance, so that other meetings may be planned that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elective cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as he needs, so that the number of cardinals entitled to vote again amounts to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, says Valero.
At present there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was "well possible" for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – all this is completely new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places were called to cardinals, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he appoints.”
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat back
General Motors is recalling just under 19,000 of its brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, according to a statement by the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
In some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for rearranging the front seat back.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety in head restraints.
"When the vehicle is driven up from the rear, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the occupants so there is an increased risk of injury," was the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recall models were produced between August 1st and September 10th.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to verify the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, had increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM explained on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
An Obama voter’s cry of despair
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the blockade tactics of the Republicans
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama’s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terribly sad book right now.
It's a book I thought would cheer me up and give me hope again during the murky second year of my medical studies.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs of the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records and go to bed in the evening, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and took their breath away from talking.
The election became a landslide victory and newscasters stopped to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% approval.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, as if being torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and diverse things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that party-political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But after defending the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have come to the end of my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign heads of state are allowed to interrogate, or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished to expose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon government".
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
At 18, I should have understood that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the Congress of Deputies is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unexplained alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fill the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with Obama’s approval falling to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become all the harder through this book.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week, I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to take a serious loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with the election assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they had to come back on course and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters are getting pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a court dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, raised the claim when he wanted to clear questions as to whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether CO2 and mining taxes are being cut or cut.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she is on leave or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with 53 votes in advance after the re-counting.
Palmer called for a review of the vote counting process so that it could be done faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where you walk in, enter the data into a computer, immediately dial it and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Tuning with pencils these days is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
A public office was about public service.
"We seek no reward other than that of history, that we can serve this community in a critical time," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two of whom are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is taking off rapidly.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigation of the world's largest financial market, where 5.3 billion US dollars change ownership every day.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that is leading to the Libor interbank scandal.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigation on this issue continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, persons close to the situation stated that RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent to and from a former trader to the UK regulatory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been given leave of absence from his current position as European Head of Forex Spot Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, former chief currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
The Instant Message group of Usher included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma had declared that it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market by a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently investigating allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has stirred up traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low currency volatility is limiting the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks means that "one can influence the market even with very low ticket prices".
The news came out the same day Credit Suisse announced that it had quit a dealer in its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle site
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle site on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for security reasons, because the terrain threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had discussed the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a banner with the message "We are for it" had been placed.
However, this did not disturb the actions of the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative.
Her motto on the big poster was "We are against construction ruins".
With this she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should one day the giant project fail.
In a conversation with many passers-by in front of the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be better for many, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they begin to resign, because the city continues to delay these answers, according to the BI.
As was heard, the mayor’s public statements also have an impact.
At the municipal council meeting in May, he had said that he feared the end of the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bath and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the citizens' decision.
Some seem to be frightened because of this, while others see them as a "pumpy attempt to blackmail" the population, according to the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Ranknick-Schelte for Schiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bullen" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings," he took protection of the two offensive twisters at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent reason for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese became an alleged drama - which was none, of course, as the TV pictures showed.
"A crass wrong decision," said Rangnick, who called referee Harkam "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He firmly defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I am the one who was insulted," stressed the 46-year-old.
But in view of the success run, Rangnick voted for a praise anthem.
"There are only two words for this: Really good," he said.
There's not much to blame for.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
Let's keep this going.
There will be hardly any changes in the cadre during the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Apart from a player's desire to leave the club," Rangnick explained.
Supreme Court Confirms Obama’s Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: The US Supreme Court ruled today that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state's tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law and held that the requirement of the Health Act, according to which states would either have to extend the access conditions for Medicaid or otherwise all state Medicaid subsidies would be deleted, was not unconstitutional.
The legal proceedings against the law had been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been strongly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunlight, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks into the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century-long dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some of the inhabitants of the valley put on sun chairs, others put on sunglasses for safety reasons.
So far, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea had existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council had finally approved the 5 million kroner (about €615,000) project.
A similar construction has given winter sunshine to the Italian alpine village of Viganella for some years.
Post barely emptys on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still on different mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and at Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld are emptied.
Whether or not Sunday will be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's question.
The social and youth political spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Rohrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday emptying is an important post service especially at appointment post.
"In spite of the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, this company is cutting this out radically and unreasonable."
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals' group and city association, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that here, secretly, the emptying times are changed or also deleted".
The post office is miles away from the citizens.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," says Bittner and Rohrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city applies, especially non-mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a letter box with Sunday emptying within walking distance.
Rohrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans to discuss this matter with the post office.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But to his knowledge there is also a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has been in favour of privatization.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees are expected to rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
This morning, the magistrate of the city is advising on a presentation by traffic director Stefan Majer (Greens).
According to this, the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, the price should not be increased, but the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket machines should be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council has to decide.
The Retail Committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce considers this "not a good idea".
The parking right in front of the shop is "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "very appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions surprise hosts
With a narrow squad the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The yellows were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it turned out that they, also due to age, could not keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstädter.
With the hard and placed surcharges, the benefactors were extremely difficult.
Repeatedly they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the net center and were not on the spot in the block defense.
Two high first rates clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadters in all matters.
In view of this overwhelming and game-defining performance, the third set was won a little bit sloppy and tedious to the 3-0 final result (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd there will be a much more powerful opponent on the field with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to assert himself clearly in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points gifts, especially in the ball acceptance; precision on the passports was sometimes in short supply and in some critical scenes the overzealousness prevented the view for possible point wins.
In this performance-wise very balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
On the fifth day of care following the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley was to be cut open on this day in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Kaiser, many hikers described this area as the highlight of the gorge path, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set their own accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental considerations could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Regierungspräsidium, following the welcome by the Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the far-sightedness coincides with the goal of preserving the now strongly grown old Allmendweid field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections for species conservation.
Tribukait said that at this point she would not miss breaking a spear for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure does not only fit seamlessly into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these various presentations, the district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been cut in advance, the forest tractor was ready to be called.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the clear view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Kopfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädt Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children's, youth and senior citizens' policy, as well as its own municipal services can be described as an attractive city, no second candidate for mayor has yet registered.
The only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, who is no longer running for mayor for reasons of age, is the 46-year-old bank clerk and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, launched an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company that was outlawed by him at Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that had bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC are making mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial bid of over $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After being outbid by Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the lawsuit patents at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the letter of complaint.
Rockstar claims a high compensation from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt sworn in first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country and thus succeeded Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, which is based on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Morsi at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, since its foundation 84 years ago, had mostly been sharply targeted by the respective government as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and contrary to the presiding magnificence of the Mubarak period, traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the motorcade could cross the usually busy road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "replacement wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the uprising of 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak to its goal.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-paneled chamber in which he took the oath of office.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army band that played the national anthem, to which he listened in a proper position.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of speakers in the largest lecture hall of the university, speaking of 'The army and the people are one hand'.
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath on Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and promised to reclaim presidential powers that the Military Council had taken over from the head of state who had been expelled from office.
However, by taking the official oath before the court and not before Parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger discotheque provides two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberger discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", tomorrow Saturday evening it goes on with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers fell by ladder: badly injured
When a defective external sensor was replaced, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder on Thursday and injured himself severely.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heater on the exterior facade of a guest house.
As he climbed on the ladder leaning on the gutter, it slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rapists in South Africa: Twice Lifelong Imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim had later died as a result of the serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused horror across the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so horrific that the nurses needed psychological assistance.
During the trial, Kana admitted to having been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
During the trial, the prosecutor also stressed that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost commonplace in South Africa: there are about 64,000 reports of sexual violence every year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
However, the police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the black rate of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": The Pro7 star visited Bonndorf for the TV show "Galileo".
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham is the pork legs, Turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the working methods of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat does he come inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach the microphone.
Jumbo spotted to strengthen fast food in Waldshut
"Here I am being worked on huge quantities," the TV makers marvel, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 clubs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what matters in terms of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with a level?
Details such as the Ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"I'm curious when you see Roberto Blanco, what happens then," says Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer sees that cutting the clubs continues to be handcrafted.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the mixture of spices and salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing remind Jumbo visually of a "submarine".
The trick: fir branches ensure the special taste of the Black Forest ham here in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," the TV star concluded.
All those involved will be able to live with it.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its earnings prospects for the full year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted pre-tax profit of between $325 and 340 million, compared to 305 to 315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are reached, this means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre generated eight percent profit in the first half of the year and posted a strong start into the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
"Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year, and some of them are well on their way towards record annual earnings before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest contributors to results.
In Australia, the leisure sector recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker business travel market.
Flight Centre's leisure business in the UK was similarly good, while business customers were also spending less.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the full year is expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre shares rose by three cents yesterday to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The examination also includes 'unseen texts' in order to encourage wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass an independent GCSE language exam, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less course work.
In a summer speech, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is "a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and stringent".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum pays more attention to 'problems from the right life', including financial mathematics.
Lovely animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours presents the Kreisverbandsleistungsschau this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The evaluations were already carried out on Thursday
Once again the local association W514 organizes this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in Soest district show here their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobbyists their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges carried out the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the evaluation of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 am and on Sunday from 10 am to 3.30 pm, which is followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a raffle equipped with stately prizes and to a deliciously stocked cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
The next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle, will focus on the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological Reflections on Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate the question in the forum, how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries and had put it on those images of heaven and hell "which still shape our ideas today", then the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes for perfection is rather characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out of Christians by religious criticism," says the speaker.
She "provided us with so many question marks that the exclamations seem to have been lost."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death".
This is connected with the question of the longing "which dreams that in the end everything will be good".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg affirm their creed in confirmation
In two divine services 101 15- and 16-year-old young people of the pastoral care unit Am Kleine Heuberg were confirmed.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Sacrament of Firm, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
Over the past few months, under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous members of the congregation, the companies had prepared for the great feast day.
In various projects they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and jointly experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In wonderful weather 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to master the circuit over the hills around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Illmensee shares this.
Among the participants were, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placings at the German championships.
These two were expected to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader managed to save a small time advance to the finish line and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was able to place himself in second place again.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that made it to the top of the winning podium.
In second and third place were Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Driver from Owingen.
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years among the youngest to over 70 years among the oldest starters.
In the main race there were even more absolute top athletes at the start this year.
Four riders were able to get away from the regional top riders.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, along with a team-mate, has already been world champion twice in the twelve-hour race.
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German championship titles in the Duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was an eyelash final in the finish line in front of the three-lake hall.
Pangerl was the first to race across the finish line.
Only a second behind that, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall classification.
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann finished third in the overall classification.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race in the women's classification.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
Traveling through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his sick father repeatedly losing consciousness and traveling to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then there was an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and yet you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of health spending in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffered to see the decision to do something about it mature in Bwelle.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people push each other in minibuses and drive with the harnessed medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Things don't always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with his wide smile and unlimited energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team then begins to examine hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The surgery usually takes place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's a hard time, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference for the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a hernia, which he had received, now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he financed 60% of his non-profit activities, according to Bwelle; the rest came from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteered to work in Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in surgeries where we can help wipe blood or think of the instruments as Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
Once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and instructions.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, fulfilling a promise that he made to his father, brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellent fight mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut on the body of Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hare in his profession of acting.
The old man Santiago can't be fooled by fishing.
So the two just complement each other great.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, the fisherman's boy Manolo is talking about.
If Santiago sits on the chair tired of life bent, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excellently masters.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and his strength of will.
Janson is on stage for a long time as a solo actor.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he illuminates the active scene in each case: the hut of Santiago, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Fagend, who sings with her songs and her beautiful voice the life feeling of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At a length of about 120 metres, a Roman-era sewer is preserved below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you will not pass the cathedral.
About 157 meters the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who marvel at the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourism directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventies the city fathers wanted a car-right city, and therefore of the remnants of the old city walls only what was not too large stopped.
Therefore, most users of the car park today also rush past the Roman remains and just park their car.
But if you look more closely, you will discover an archaeological site in the park deck D2 separated by metal bars.
About five metres high ruins of handplate-sized stones can be seen.
"They are remnants of the Roman city walls that were built in the second half of the first century AD," Schulze explains.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper level of the park take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants descend again into the depths.
Here we experience the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "City Roman right and city of the Agrippinens, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult".
And the praetorium is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the anteroom of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here at a length of about 120 meters.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," Schulze cheers up the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After picking up the key at the cash register, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground in order to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for ritual washing.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe becomes part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work is to begin shortly.
However, a few years will pass before completion.
Leg almost hacked off: reissue of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is re-opened after over four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
He is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecutor's office accuses them of stabbing and beating three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing Hells Angels group.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, a chase with several cars had taken place.
According to the prosecution, it was a matter of district fights and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in an initial trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proved that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof annulled the judgment after revision of the prosecutor's office and referred it back to the district court for further trial.
One of the defendants is currently in open court for another offence.
At the beginning it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the Tatnacht.
As a witness, the investigator at the time was invited.
The focus was on cell phone calls from the defendants and other people who had been intercepted by the police.
It is difficult that Rocker almost always adheres to a law of brass for them in court - and not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Public prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said on demand that new traces have appeared since the last trial.
The process is scheduled for eleven further days of negotiations.
The disposable society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people in the passenger and back seat the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What's closer than going chilly to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little something?
I admit, I like to be there when it comes late at night or early in the morning to get fast food.
Some fries, a Coke, a Burger - and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco singers are noticeable.
Because what must you miss, that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags lie on the edge of the road and on parking lots.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It's not just that the paper stuff spoils the landscape.
Bags have also covered up traffic facilities such as guardrails and thus caused accidents.
But not thinking about this kind of thing, she probably doesn't even know what that word actually means.
If you are on the road more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know how a back seat can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
A few bags wouldn't make any difference - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I already see the day coming when the cities and communities will be too stupid to clear the way - and the fast food chains will have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama’s Withdrawal in Health Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama yesterday pulled back on his often repeated, unequivocal promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands received a letter of resignation from their insurer, the Republicans accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"They can retain the vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama called on those Americans who have received such communications to look for a new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"You're coming up with a better offer," he said.
The government described it as not surprising that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans: they deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the House of Representatives' Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to a counselor sitting behind her at yesterday's House of Representatives hearing was taken up after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri, which was about whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced a state-sponsored insurance scheme to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov itself, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
On Thursday, an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed to the American news channel CNN that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an air base in Latakia, Syria, the day before.
According to CNN, the target was "missiles and associated equipment", which the Israeli government feared were destined for the Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been bombarded on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis had been held responsible.
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, where Russian S-125 Newa missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles were on display, which Channel 2 reported to have a range of 35 kilometres and could transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an anonymous Israeli government official saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
In any case, a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense said: "We are not commenting on these reports."
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried earlier, partly successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a "red line" that would be followed by a military response.
John Kerry states in an unprecedented admission that the US espionage has "immeasurably gone too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, indicated a weakening of the US's defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying that in certain cases espionage had gone "inadequately too far."
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for switching to "autopilot" when the explosive revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities became public.
The leaked information has led the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
Mr Kerry said during a video-based speech at the London Open Government Conference: 'There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of a number of things that have happened virtually by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was what was left of the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, of 11 September.'
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the U.S. espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases, this has gone too far.'
The President is determined to clarify the matter and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be compromised in this trial.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved by its monitoring operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept this and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terror efforts, as the chair of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations because of the frustration about monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that Europeans remain on board with a view to our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first Democrat to sit in the Senate and is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies, although this week's head of intelligence said the reports were incorrect and were based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed on by Snowden that the NSA had monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared it to be common practice on both sides.
In all this tumult, Murphy said his authority was preparing the trip of Congress to be held this year, hoping that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating MEPs will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they themselves have been using for years.
"Although we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect Europeans' rights, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the resentment about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away match of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is looking for an assignment by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he's only been able to do it individually.
"We will decide on his deployment at short notice," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorer with six goals.
After all, the Mainzers already have to give up the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian Appeals against Prison in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15th, after she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning on Sunday, June 10th, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to making up the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on site.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra to ask for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are very concerned, of course, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the verdict and is at large on a security deposit of 50,000 baht.
In Australian reports it was said that in the meantime she is on vacation in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
According to the court, Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand could try to improve its damaged tourist image, and it is therefore acquitted.
