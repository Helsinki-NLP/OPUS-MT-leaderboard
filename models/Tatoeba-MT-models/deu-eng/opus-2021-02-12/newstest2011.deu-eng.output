What should it do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionary".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old and new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city council.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has "knocked off" members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as they dominate the notorious slang that has become a naturalized in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary introduced by Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite in the past era is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils showed that these new concepts are somewhat in the dark.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague's politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, responded to the test of the "paternal vocabulary".
But also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of slang."
From the vocabulary published by the Aktuálně.cz newspaper in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editors picked out six terms, especially those which are notoriously linked to the Prague magistrate.
The social democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "biggest Prague golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "battle-napping", "tradition of the capital" and "bleaching".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the discussion first, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and I don't judge how civil democrats talk to each other."
"For me, it is important how we understand each other in our programmes," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not realize in the headline mentioned above that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, is mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all, and the only term he correctly guessed during the test was "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added for safety: "But I know this more from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "golf hole" is then correctly deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure can be found, and thus also what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that is to go to some Prague restaurant business", Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he asserts that he has drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary is his own.
According to the test participants, there really does not seem to be a similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is really no such thing in us."
"We call by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says Petr Hulínský, chairman of Prague's ČSSD - called "Hulda" by his party comrades.
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is for the party comrades friendly the "Opa" or less friendly the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by machinations at the party sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
So nicknames are the only thing that the social democrats allow in the inner partisan language.
Hulínský is said not to like it when he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz also registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the rubber club rights" is said to be related to the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more of the older generation, they find no work - for health reasons, for example, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared this, as they help with their work and give birth to children," a nun describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, where more than one hundred women were expelled from their communities in a special home.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he published a brochure to prevent "witch tracking".
There's a catch in this.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "DerStandard" pointed out the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But to be accused of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured kerosene on her and simply set her on fire.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter had only been a clash of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointings.
After the group tried to "exorce" "an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people here without regard to their education.
"Der Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fresses of human souls are a danger in the past as they are today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch-hunt, last year the President of the Gambian Republic himself was properly involved.
"President Yahya Jammeh started a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, because they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president by black magic."
"To this end, he called on Shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President's guard, forcibly abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in their report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the detained people did not survive their stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that the nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - but still pays higher rent
An elderly man is leaving the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a portfolio with three new leases to three dwellings: for the own and the dwellings of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just increased their rent within the framework of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, next year the son will be able to rent 4100 kroner for a 2-room apartment with kitchen in the second category.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal oven," he writes with an angry finger on the new lease of the son, for whose signature he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed it," he explains, half-dissented and half-resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental terms as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, when they intend to publish instructions on how to take action against such contracts.
But the man's just waving.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region is thus becoming a major "deregulation laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation is imminent for most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid market-oriented rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already packed at nine o'clock this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller.
"Rent 2011" is how a special touch field shines on the touch screen.
Briefly typed and the device spits out a number slip.
As soon as we have deciphered the number "157" and already it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November onwards, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new leases will flow into the mailboxes of most of the tenants of the total of 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty proposes to them in the letters a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for the new rentals in the client center is open since November 18th.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, that's just the beginning," the ladies behind the switch answer after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' homes are a hot topic.
Before the elections, Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, who comes from Ostrava, raised this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They couldn't even change toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning breathes air.
Up to now, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly waiting at the counter to see if they really get the promised rental discount that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who sign the new lease by 15 December, will also benefit from a half-discounted February rent.
Up to now, however, "deregulatory switch" is anything but overloaded by demands.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were here because of", the counter officers estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites and wall panels, where it seems necessary.
However, if the rent parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG explains on its websites.
"No one goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty, and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially agrees with her.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pensions, of which 5,000 are left for food, where should I get the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee gets insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in the majority of the Czech Republic on New Year 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty and - especially the neglect of the housing fund, criticized by the angry tenants, is the main reason for the rent increase, according to the home owners.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in housing from the rents taken between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Hav
"The rent increases in 2011 of 15% and less concern 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"This always means a maximum of CZK 7,50 per square meter per month", can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter," argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not push up rents, but will gradually take place within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation: all revenues from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the homes, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - above all, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a minikindergarten here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design since last year.
The design and architectural office Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of well-known Brno buildings originate, counted from the first drafts for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is interested in the fact that the projecters and architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the opportunity to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for civil engineers and architects to reconcile their demanding profession and child care.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The company's mini-kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from the European Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (contributions of CZK 2.8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and for a period of 2 years qualified staff and operation are provided.
After using up the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the Minikindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with Economy Rating providing active assistance in the implementation of applications.
The children are looked after by fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can attend children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day alternates over several children.
The kindergarten business is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although individual education and care are involved, the programme content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, and they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress is eliminated when the children are late picked up from a far away kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also emerging here.
Arch.Design thus ranks among the Czech companies, which offer clear benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants the house with its organic forms got the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colours and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
It is only with a closer look that one notices that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order.
At night, the entire façade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination enhances the shine of the colors.
The same sweeping lines and intricate shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and bars.
The Batlló house in the Eixample district, on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was built by the renovation of a house dating back to 1877, executed by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end he agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper conversion.
The Casa Batlló apartment building, however, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on its drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of reality arose and the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other painters and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in the Park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given the nickname "Knochenhaus" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "guy house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the Patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces for the house, which was unique at that time.
It's a bit bizarre. Her 45-degree tilt is already on.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all of the building regulations of the time and was by no means misled by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so horrified at the completion that they demanded a remedy.
Among other things, the councillors stumbled upon the fact that the building with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no changes, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the city's request for this to happen - and Josep Batlló applied for permission to rent the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by the opening of the salon doors and thus a larger society could chat comfortably without having to forego a certain intimacy during more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new façade, the house received a rather unusual roof and two additional floors.
Gaudí's play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is covered and the courtyards are impressive.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
In doing so, he simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The homeowners decided only in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was discovered that this was a quite profitable business, the visits were kept, even extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a pappenstiel, it amounts to 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In the selection many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and last but not least also the sex of the sleeper.
Just as important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend home where heat is not regularly provided, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to become "warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
Because if they don't have enough vents in the core and are also lying on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is not excluded that under their mould forms.
Of course, what you are used to also plays a role in the election.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Well, all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their skinned shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"Among other things, I recommend these to people with diabetes who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why I got these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam) for many ice hockey players years ago, but also for other customers.
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it clings to the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, in the night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound burn).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles of your feet to your height, i.e. approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman, who are about 180 cm tall, need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of lying width available, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For convenience and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are lying on your back, there should be plenty of room for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholstery and interior decorators, who has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and who also presents this topic at technical schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, there is no other option than to mount the grates at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be taken from the mould layer and the fine padding.
"You can't feel the feathers with your hand or when you sit down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and underlay like grown-up siam twins have nothing to do in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) sieve.
This is also why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even a lifetime guarantee for mattresses.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not shy away from the hygiene of washable, removable covers, nevertheless it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattress covers with all-round zippers are usually made today, so that you get two halves after opening (in all important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially executed alone, often looks like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a hard plate in bed instead of a rust?
Out with it!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, you should use the plate with ventilation holes (if there are already none in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a backing.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable slatted gratings with 14 to 18 slatted gratings (lamellas), always paying off gratings with a larger number of slats, i.e. 28 or more slatted gratings, with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebrae area and the possibility to regulate the slatted hardness.
Mattresses with spring skeleton do not belong to adjustable lamella gratings, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring bars, which allows the spring bars to be pressed in or even angled so that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink in selectively.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft areas for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also remembered - they are given these soft areas in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are determined.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and proper rust, most advantages are lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm large pillow seems ideal, as the Scandinavians, for example, like it.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
The new magic word for mattresses is also called "organic".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used to produce polyurethane foams - for example castor oil and soybean oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is the name of mattresses, which are made of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Va
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
You can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scents while sleeping.
Here, too, there is a difference between man and woman.
While in men a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers have "warming" effect for women.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes pleasantly warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than conventional polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffnesses (hardnesses) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to rap.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower value added tax as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
Saving on the mattress and rust is not so easy.
Occasionally, there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers offering two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with visco foam memory reinforced in the cover for CZK 11,990.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launch.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, in cool milieu it solidifies again.
So it adapts perfectly to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but generally increases sleeping comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to make the legs and vessels easier.
Local manufacturers, for example, use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to keep the kids under control
The fear for one's own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, can locate people just as well, which would also be helpful in such cases, as in the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it will not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have been frightened by the disappearance of Anička, so they look for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but about an effective means of reducing the probability that tragedy will occur," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases such devices can be misused, for example if you put it in someone's pocket without him knowing about it, but we have not had such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they don't want to be controlled."
"At the beginning, the mobile phones already aroused great expectations among parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with him that could be used to locate it."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which provides positioning services for both automobiles and persons, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set so that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"For more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to install a special software.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that they are either devices in matchbox size that resemble trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There's always a danger of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin from Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital clocks are being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a surveillance or tracking device.
"Or he only realizes after some time what gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - towards bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in vehicle tracking.
Thus, the combination of tracking function with the help of the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses that you could wrap the whole Czech Republic to keep you but only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of fuses, to be detonated with explosives.
The year before, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of fuse to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the fuse from the stock company STV Group, a. s. for shabby 40 million kroner.
In his reasoning for purchasing this huge amount of fuse, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume 60 kilometers of fuse annually.
According to the research of Army pyrotechnicians, who approached MF DNES, this information shows that the whole army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the Army Command, to secretaries and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fuses.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that two metres of fuses are sufficient to train every new professional soldier, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the 225 years already mentioned - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneer and special units.
Recently, soldiers from the Rapid Operations Brigade complained to the Minister of Defence Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises due to the lack of funds were severely restricted.
Not to mention underpants.
"I don't know why they buy so many fuses from us."
But that's ultimately their decision, they'll know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we as dealers would like to meet as much as possible," says STV Group sales manager Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, explains the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of fuses by saying that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only speaks of a four-year service life of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnicians only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned above are probably also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, so that he is not accused of criticizing the army as a soldier.
At the end of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not endangers the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the volume discount for the 445 km fuse.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," says Spokesman Pejšek, telling us about the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of explosive fuses by police pyrotechnicians who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood has barely exceeded 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police always only order such quantities of these ammunition that they can use before the end of their service life.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus reliable fuses is also kept open.
The Ministry of Defence is already having huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who approached MF DNES, in a few years the Czech armed forces are expecting the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old fuses, which they have bought so "favourably" today.
To this day I have found the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition
Lukáš Pytloun's winning position in the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition helped to sell the franchise of his hotel.
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec won the last year of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition.
The story of his success looks like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there was a lack of good accommodation in Liberec at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holidays abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he developed a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profit in the house, which he then converted step by step to a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has opened four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
Until recently, the most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun Hotels franchise have already registered", says the entrepreneur number one last year.
"Large share in this licensing sale for operating hotels just had the victory in the competition "Entrepreneur of the Year", adds Mr. Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory has brought him greater fame, yes, popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that it did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend to all those who want to create something to take part in this competition.
You don't have to win right away, any visualization is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have happened at all.
"I still have regular business relationships with some of the people I met thanks to the competition."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success also has a little impact on each of his employees.
And there he has the seventy.
"I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is generally recognized."
I really don't see this just as a personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name has only come to the fore a little," Lukáš Pytloun modestly says.
I wish my successors a quieter year when we had it in Farmet
Victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has done the worst.
The award for the first place of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in the last year was received by Karel
At the time, the jury paid tribute to the efforts he made in Česká Skalice to stamp out a company from the ground that makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel
A short time later, they began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the mentioned competition and its medialization that it also entered the consciousness of the non-specialist public.
"Not only did our customers perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but also our foreign partners began to attach greater value to the fact that they can work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel
The past year, however, was not only about victory euphoria at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool making products.
The crisis, which shook the citizens even less at the time, but above all companies, was just reaching its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchasing of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not escape this situation."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even resort to dismissals," explains Karel
A viable company may also have to take such unpopular measures.
But it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black numbers, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to make cuts - in terms of investment in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel
An opinion poll that cleans up with stupid rules
The opinion poll on the "Absurdity of the Year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some foolish regulations have been able to get out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" was the duty to create documents on authorities that are available online.
Thus, more than a third of less than four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the opinion poll.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the Commercial Register for checks of social security payers," said ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to remove the absurd ones.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the Czech business newspaper (HN) and enjoys growing public popularity.
If last year the three thousand people took part in the vote, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to hinder business activity.
"In terms of the number of income tax forms, for example, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlsek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurship has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of terms and conditions, and 8th in terms of terms and conditions compared to the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was first announced in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of the competition at the end of September.
The website address www.firmaroku.cz is used for the registration. After that, the organiser of the competition selects seven candidates for the "Antipreis" and lets the public vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz via the Internet.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, or more precisely 105, senseless regulations and orders have already been notified for this year's opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to prepare every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November on Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a happening in which personalities of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, participated in the highlight of the competition.
"Where the state throws clubs between the entrepreneurs' legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so my goal is to remove at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today make it unnecessary for entrepreneurs to make their business more difficult," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to remove absurd orders from the world are effective.
In 2007, people were most disturbed by the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to report three days in advance to the trade office at the place of their permanent establishment the intention to drive with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or fair.
This obligation was abolished by means of an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report work trips of employees up to 30 days to the employment office - was abolished by the law on them so-called "green card".
And - all good things are three:
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation that imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a fridge and two scales in the speaking room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the fridge requirement fell.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support those companies that are aware of the impact of their entrepreneurial activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile communications company Vodafon, who is the exclamator and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year" competition.
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year, companies registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and would offer enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject matter of their activities, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is, for example, about hanged people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for children with a high profile for seventeen years.
A paper mill in Poděbrady also provides exemplary care for its disabled employees, who account for 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region"; in the competition Vodafone Firm of the Year it took third place in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a fluid and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We try to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our business activity and administration on the environment," explains its managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region is in turn interested in the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, it also promotes home work for its employees and in corporate actions it uses Cartering services, which are offered by a domestic sheltered workshop.
"In addition, we support the "People in Need" Foundation, which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary region is worth mentioning, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with food, work, skills and holidays," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the category Responsible Company of the Year all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the Year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire submitted to the registration and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were therefore not disqualified."
"A separate registration for this competition is not possible, as it is only a sub-category of the main competition Firm of the Year", explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Soil Fund - Arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken away by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter had allegedly attempted to manipulate a current public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in competition were granted to a specific interested party.
He is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At this point in time, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person for the offence of fraudulent activities in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the newspaper "Právo", and could not provide further details in view of the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
The way in which he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated about in view of the sparse official information.
Spokeswoman of the Soil Fund Lubomír Černá referred to Právo's question in this regard that the police had actually taken arrests in the Pilsner branch of the Soil Fund and did so during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she concretized.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct designation "call for the submission of claims for the transfer of land under the Land Law" and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the land offered.
"In the context of the request, these persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared real estate value."
"According to the claims offered, the order of potential purchasers is determined, and the land fund then transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the fund's spokesperson.
Luboš G. was obviously available information about who had applied for the request and since he was a legitimate person himself, having bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a property interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat severance pay.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large sum of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. already had too good contacts to the Pilsner Soil Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Soil Fund, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitutions, on which site decisions on construction projects had already been made.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. also purchased land from the Soil Fund for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the point where the construction of the access road to the Borské Pole industrial park was planned.
Later, he traded it very cheaply with the magistrate for a house right in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the town hall had to hand in small-heartedly in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
The cost of housing for households increases by a few hundred monthly
As of January, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges and for district heating and rents in some places.
As of January, families will have to withdraw several hundred kroner more from the wallet each month than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places also increase the cost of district heating supplies.
The electricity tax alone costs households a few hundred kroner a year.
The high electricity prices have been reduced by all the main suppliers, which is to blame for the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic plants.
Although gas is only moderately more expensive, this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred more crowns are expected per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Larger places in particular are planning price increases.
For example, from January onwards, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kroner more per month for district heating, and more than 1000 kroner more per year for families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, face 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges, in case the city increases its infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, remains among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rent increases can be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will disappear from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree with this rent increase, the company wants to sue you.
The regulated rents, which are still being paid in nearly 300,000 apartments, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once also a good whisky, which was stolen from the house bar from the father.
These are the drinks after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen need the most emergency treatment.
No exception are children who have to sleep their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the children's wards of clinics.
"Beer or wine are out of fashion because it takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief physician of the Children's Department in the Central Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
"Whisky, if the father succeeds in stealing a bottle from the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or Vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with Juice, then it doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief physician.
The spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him.
"The most common thing is about fernet or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, who was taken away from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception in hospital admissions.
Before the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken pupils from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first admitted with 3.5 per mille alcohol in her blood and in combination with "Extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't feel strange that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief physician wonders.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance for stumbling with their offspring that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, children are not about real dependence in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to the spokesman for Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local Department of Child and Adolescent Medicine until mid-November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning requiring hospitalisation are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home after outpatient treatment by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police will not be registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink such a bottle of liquor in the school bench, according to Mr. Pelikán, there are three seasonal amplitudes that are 100% reliable: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for grief for the bad testimony or for joy on vacation."
"On Walpurgisnacht I also experienced seven drunken children in the reception at once," Dr. Pelikán emphasizes.
Paradoxically, a drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only struggles with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches in the morning, which are caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, can be eliminated in the hospital with a fluid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, which sometimes spoils the patient's mood by giving them the cost of the treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousand crowns.
"Once in a while, I used this as an educational tool when I directly told the children during the visit what cost their drunkenness and that it could well happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for one such party," Dr. Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures in order to claim the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have been owned by a foreign army.
They were only seen abroad during maneuvers or flight shows.
This is about the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are currently still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over them last week.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, Jan Pejšek is not yet known when she physically expedates the aircraft from Vodochody.
The L-159 single-seat fighter aircraft, in turn, were separated from long-term stored aircraft without any further deposits and investments by the Ministry's department.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were replaced in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek to the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to manage without two-seater fighter planes, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seater version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second one she wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to enforcing the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the company EADS is the customer of aircraft L-159 and that they are intended to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore the customer's responsibility to see how he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
Last year, the government of Mirek Topolánek approved the barter trade of five L-159 for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not tendered for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero, of which it only used 24, and wanted to sell the rest.
By the way, the purchase of Casa airplanes should also have a court replay.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice for the reason that it would have had to select the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger appear to be at less risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This is supposed to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said Ros Eeles, co-author of the study, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at Warwick University.
The finger could help to determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are present, such as family health stress, Ms Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was valid as for 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, for men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, for men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which already form at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone in particular accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said that he was familiar with this study, yet he did not consider the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly stuck snow, the winter servicemen were on the axis all night in many places.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed because of some accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 near Brno "stands" in the direction of Prague.
This is what Novinky.CZ of the dispatchers of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK) said.
At km 91 a truck crashed, at km 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the ditch.
There are also problems at km 185 on the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks have collided.
Drivers should leave just behind Brno at km 190 or drive over Brno and drive up at km 182 at the village of Kývalka.
There are miles of traffic jams.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that immediately at the access to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimetres thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, motorcades are formed in the town of Prosek, and the street Štěrboholská is also completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run late, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis unit will meet.
There are also problems with the railways and at the airport.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven express trains due to snow drifts.
Problems arise, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun route.
Travellers should be informed about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vyškov there are three side roads completely inaccessible, in the vicinity of Brno snow drifts are formed in places and in the vicinity of Blansko it is necessary to use snow cutters on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V
There are still three roads completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, snow blowers will have to be used to clear snow.
Until now, it is not possible to estimate when they will be accessible again.
In the Hodonín region, caution is needed in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which for nature conservation reasons can only be sprinkled with inert scattering agents, lies a snow cover up to five centimetres thick, ČTK led.
In the Czech Republic, fresh snow fell from two to ten centimetres, mostly in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimetres.
Up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian region.
But in the Czech Republic it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have for the first time used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which is only known by its code designation XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise cannon.
Their projectiles are steered by laser with a accuracy of only a few meters to the goal.
The special bullets of calibre 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and contain highly explosive explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The missiles can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
In other words, they can be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically goes like this: he aims at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, he gains a precise point of view, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to press off.
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and shoots the bullet at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialized in computer and maintenance announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their jobs from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt's Niederrad district.
A spokeswoman from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the Group were to be accommodated there, which had previously been distributed across the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices in Astro Park would also be better suited to the working methods of the employees.
Fujitsu was also only a tenant in Bad Homburg.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt's economic director Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" had been won again.
This is a "great location statement".
Fujitsu passed the city, the settlement was an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
Now it was a matter of preventing a long vacancy at such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on Rathausplatz, previously used by Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" (Little Vertical) were among the most controversial construction projects of the spa town with the remaining buildings on Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new urban arena was created between the railway station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously partly used parking areas as well as the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then still associated with Siemens, moved into the homes.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu conucer is known as the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving into Frankfurt-Niederrad from Bad Homburg, the other subsidiaries at this location are said to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped layout - the central association of electrical and electronic industries has its headquarters, among other things.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats Against Assange
Wikileaks are becoming increasingly distressed.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Maybe it's political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
Wikileaks founder Assange is said to be in England.
The exposure platform Wikileaks is increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
American Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's search lists, is supposed to be in the UK after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks supplanted by Amazon servers."
"Free Speech in the Land of the Free," the unveiling activists announced via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in publishing the secret diplomatic dispatches in order to cope with the high access numbers to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks further explained: "Excellent - our dollars are now being spent to keep people in Europe busy."
If Amazon had such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's staff did research, CNN reported, referring to Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," the senator said.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called for the platform to refuse to be used on servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and ruthless action puts our national security at risk and endangers life around the globe," said a statement by the non-party senator.
"No responsible company - American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities for suspected rape, is on Interpol's search list.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian stays in the UK, the exact location is known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange rightly fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an advisor to head of government Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said on TV that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange, there was an exchange of blows.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The American government is now putting the protection of its databases to the full test.
Russell Travers, Vice-Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Activities, informed the White House that he had been appointed as Special Representative.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary after Wikileaks published the message reports.
The White House also wants to check ways in which the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The American government also announced its intention to ensure the security of dissidents and the most active should they be put at risk by the Wikileaks release.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Secretary Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect her if that is necessary."
The University of Ice
At Gelato University near Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest inflow and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the Gelatatiere and from the Gelataio.
The gelatier, in German somewhat ancient the ice confectioner, produces the cream according to all rules of Italian ice-maker art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cold counter with a spatula, removes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you can't get past the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice-cream university has established the manufacturer of ice-cream machines in 2003 so that the ice-cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest inflow and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also special courses for several days around the chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlor.
Some people dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, while others simply venture onto the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag something of her own after years in a annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
During his training, Luciano does not forget the icing on the cake of the national and even southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano dips the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools down to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Immediately the lecturer is attacked with questions: Can ice cream only be produced with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to one's own desire for experimentation?
Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the times.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also produce ice without a stabilizer, but then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it accumulates in itself, and the customer bites on all the ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice cream Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which turns with eggs into a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate temptations.
Now the students are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano makes four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also being carried out on the varieties of fruit ice cream.
More flavoring substances, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture really highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a computational task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winers measure the Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computing easier.
Making ice does not require as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device helps for automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is creamy at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small breakdowns do not fail.
The Brazilian Gustavo grudges himself and his course colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when the oversized rod mixer gets out of his control.
"In every class," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time before something like this happens."
Controllers in twilight
The European Food Authority Efsa had been infiltrated by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
The expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology, is now making this accusation.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Christoph Then, head of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
Harry Kuiper, head of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbyist association for years.
This is paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper had played a major role in the Efsa test regulations for gene plants and was therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The Efsa regulations are word by word with the Ilsi's position papers, thus deceiving the handwriting of industry, which is supposed to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech is imposing a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager had recently changed sides without any conditions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta.
The Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently revealed personnel connections between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Environment Agency and the European Parliament public.
However, the Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
One opinion states that all serious data should be relied on, including those of industry, as long as they are of high technical quality.
The experts who work for Efsa are not required to have no contacts with the industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This calls itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
On the matter, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently being approved in animals without any feeding test and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize is doing in the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" asks Then accusingly.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
Industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this field, as in the US, too, in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would not normally be published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of the Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: in September the excavators had moved and had begun to break off a large part of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When construction stopped, much of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim mussel limestone, a soft coarse stone, installed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You mustn't leave."
He enthuses: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with those chunks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Steine leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those who got killed in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would be ground into gravel or disappear into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden pad that was once a watchhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when the newspapers said in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it were to happen, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were to be used again.
Some 200 S-21 opponents took one of the 80-kilogram quadres with them, unit price 6.50 to 14 Euro.
In memory, but also in the hope of being able to return it during reconstruction.
500 tons had been bought by Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest is sold long ago.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Häuslebauer.
They had come from everywhere and dragged away what trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the push have long since been transformed into "mowers" or limits of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He gets into his SUV, takes a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and dropped out, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
He's storing 40,000 tons of rocks.
He keeps his treasures together from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest stone dealer in the Republic.
He's slowing down.
In the snow are artfully carved sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Marienbrücke in Dresden," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he's raving.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
He points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
Go on.
"Beautiful travertine."
Once, the quads belonged to the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatt Travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Cathedral of Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones were cut by hand and moved with simple pulleys and ox carts, he becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal to shred such a thing."
He didn't get rich, he didn't get rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, and stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the recycler.
Soon he'll have to go to Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Talent fight for high potentials
There's a lot of crowd at the buffet.
16 students crowd around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition they should talk about the car of the future together with VW developers - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now going into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates in the lecture halls as early as possible before they enter the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish any statements about the achievements of their students, they try to spot the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company advertises the talents.
A young lady from the HR department distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the company.
Nico Selle of the TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, VW can get to know students, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
What is new is that the students are so aggressively stumped.
"Otherwise, the focus was on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
Instead, they have to come to terms with themselves and especially with highly skilled workers.
Graduates from the engineering disciplines in particular are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even larger according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt, in which the participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the USA next year.
By the way, the participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
If you are allowed to take part, you decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger when they hit and hit the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was not enough for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to work.
"We still have contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct Buhlen on the campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also go on a classic career at trade fairs.
"We try to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Etwa at the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young people.
There are currently 35 vacancies advertised on the company's website.
"It's very hard to occupy vacant positions right now."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give hints that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not on the agenda at the solar specialist.
For this purpose, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large company often cannot offer this," says HR Manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the leading role in the search for a job.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for advancement are other key factors.
In a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual ranking of German employers.
It questions employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Stübe also hopes to gain points from the placement among job seekers.
"I think applicants are looking especially for external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within one's own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, then they would advertise their employer with friends and acquaintances on their own.
"It's like playing with a gang," says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
The government in Washington has issued a ban on this - and thus definitively revokes its previous plans.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast for the time being.
This was announced by Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Prior to the disaster that killed eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Proponents want to reduce the US' dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not yet been resolved.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is expected to present its results in the course of December.
In October, Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the drill stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies had immediately submitted proposals for new drilling projects.
With tougher controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe.
At present, the competent control authority, which was discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is undergoing fundamental reform.
At the same time, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
Industry now publicly warns that more stringent regulation would significantly reduce production in the Gulf.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey conducted by the consultant company BDO - even before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also deplores the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investment in new support projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of spilled crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't fight off," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to photograph a boy wading to his chest in the water with the streaks surrounding him: in the rainbow-colored water shine the scene looks almost pretty.
It is not to be seen that brown crude oil floats under the surface.
She used to collect shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the sluggish running waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil poured out of a broken pipeline into the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: the Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps crossed by rivercourses, the whole extent of devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat stirs up brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude from the ground like black licorice rods, sad to find palm trees hanging their fronds.
In vain are flocks of birds, as are usual in wetlands: As soon as the outboard is silent, the former paradise, which smells like a gas station, spreads spooky calm.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari sinisterly: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battleground that has been fought for decades: here more than 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe invaded, here in the 1980s the first resistance was organized with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell company had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the Company is denied a return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of the triple size of Switzerland, with over 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, and the Group is in too unstable a position.
Every few hundred metres steel frames rise like bizarre sculptures out of the water: "Christ-trees" are called the heads of the holes far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drilling head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters have flowed into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that entered the sea off Alaska in the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
Those who are to be held responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU are disputed about this.
While the Shell Group is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution caused by sabotage and organized oil theft, environmentalists see drilling heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell set significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the company in 2008: The rate of defects on the lines alone is "many times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop under the open sky from a distance, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are stark naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the premises, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, head of the group.
At first, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the trap, later dripping kerosene and finally diesel at the end of the line.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres of diesel every day: "That brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The Delta people use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still undercut the ridiculously low price of diesel with just under 40 euro cents per litre: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "Bunkers" that tap the pipeline across Ogoniland: this is how experts say the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day in the entire Niger Delta.
However, only a small part of the temporarily stored raw material is illegally refined: the lion's share is filled by organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, in tankers and sold on the world market.
The activist Akpobari believes that the debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the relocation of the population or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
"If the oil companies had not been perceived as invaders and had not destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni's relationship with Shell was destroyed to such an extent that only a withdrawal of the company could be considered: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese might turn out to be better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"Maximum time for you to disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"The soldiers can come any minute."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the armed forces' special unit, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful bribe.
Like all Nigerians, the soldiers who come mainly from the country's north also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators detect dangerous construction errors in A380 engines
The A380 apparently has a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error during the investigation of an emergency-landed machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas emergency-landed airbus at the beginning of November were obviously much more fortunate than previously known: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 machines during its investigations - and now warns of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, according to a statement published on Thursday by the ATSB authority.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
Rolls-Royce's engines in 20 A380 aircraft were affected.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed a plea in law with an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allowed it to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire of the engine, parts had loosened and the wings had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety problem had been considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily dropped three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa switched off the engine in an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Land-wide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Snow fell over night almost all over the country.
On many roads there is chaos, trains and flights fail.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: In icy temperatures, almost the whole Republic is snowing towards Thursday at night - which in many places leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and east lie some 15 centimetres thick snow blankets.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly new snow.
In addition, severe gusts swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrography Office (BSH) expects storm floods with water levels of 1.2 metres above the normal level on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, snow drifts on the motorways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the severe weather center Meteomedia, the alarm level was therefore violet in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level ever.
Partly there fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
There were several trucks and cars stuck there at night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities also reported major disturbances on the streets.
Snow and wind on the A2 led to increasing traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia, the snowfalls affected the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or destroyed overhead lines and turnouts are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance services had to be stopped from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied with blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescue workers.
Snowwinds swept across the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
According to a spokesperson for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been reported in Munich.
According to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers were at the airport, there were still almost 400 beds available for them.
Accidents occurred on many roads already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was captured on a level crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had crossed her car near Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
But the meteorologists have good news: although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will stir up even with slight gusts.
But the wind will slow down.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - sometimes up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to break away from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters attractive: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernised; in the meantime, bankers have been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs for the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a speaker.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate ourselves and then rent it back," he said.
This means that Germany's largest credit institution will return its head office after a short time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and then extensively renovated.
According to the figures, the energy conversion swallowed up around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to industry experts, the newspaper's towers, which have now been renamed "Greentowers", estimate the value of around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands mourn for dead mates
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies have still not been recovered, because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
About two weeks ago, there had been a violent explosion at the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the misfortune shaft, but had discovered no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now family members and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people had gathered in the sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
She was silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, there were 29 tables on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies could be seen.
Images and personal items, including garments and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags blew half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key said to the participants in the memorial ceremony.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration.
During the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were displaced, it would begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
Hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit in with the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn uses his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising" to retrace old genre boundaries.
Which audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents in rows with almost superhuman forces - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and tears his enemies' intestines out of his living body once he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, Eineye, as it is actually called, doesn't say a word about the whole film, and the other characters can only be carried away by one or two sentences or a few agonizing death cries.
Otherwise, it is silent and shimmered in Scotland's creepyly beautiful hilly landscape, which provides the backdrop to the Viking world from about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cineasts with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
Well, if a movie has several target groups, only a pity if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but refuses stoically to make his works accessible to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the Arthouse with a little more humor.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the splashing brain mass and intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, Eineye sets off to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries by ship and is stuck in a fluff and fog for an eternity before the crew apparently arrives in America and remains silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" did not find a movie rental in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it's all atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And there is no escape from it for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and, with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, slowly closes his throat, but above all with the incredible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who stands loyally by the side of one eye keeps something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who, for enemies and temporary allies, eventually becomes a warrior from hell, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means ruin, but perhaps only for those who are already spoiled.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, upset and amazement.
An experience.
Enigmatic Earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to comment on this - nor does it allow controls.
Around midnight on September 5 to 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates River; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the square with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that is draining from the electricity.
According to a briefing from the CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technique from the 1950s is hardly suitable.
The CIA performed a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images.
By means of computer animation, she showed where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos showing the building from close up or even the interior.
The reactor had been on the verge of commissioning, they said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, little more is known than at that time, yes, the puzzles became rather larger in time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar before the attack, but saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some secret service workers in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of an "alleged reactor", even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat replied in the summer only lapidarly that the IAEA "had enough material to ask questions".
The Syrians quickly removed the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly planned the site.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial operators from a Member State directly after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always insisted that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus declared.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
It also denied the inspectors a second inspection into el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the bombed building.
But Israel also remains silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack.
As a result, the investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008 and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a high-ranking Western diplomat admits at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, over which the IAEA is monitoring.
The IAEA apparently sees three other facilities as the key to progress in the reconnaissance process, which are supposed to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and unlike this one, they still exist.
The inspectors have so far not disclosed what installations they are, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally calls them Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, Isis, has identified these sites and identified a complex of buildings near Masyaf on satellite images, most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - that is precisely why Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the USA to spy out military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite images, that material has been transported back and forth between the three locations and the square at the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there were "no indications of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb was later to be separated from, there are at best plausible assumptions on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces was stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the rubble has remained.
The IAEA is considered unlikely to be the Al-Tibni salt mine located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, which Syria investigated in 1998 for its suitability as a storage facility for radioactive waste.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to remove the suspicion.
Diplomatic circles have also said that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - but the effort alone shows how much interest the inspectors are interested in.
However, Damascus also ironed off this proposal.
A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna had appeased that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter is not urgent, for example, US ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing in so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Vienna Atomic Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA leader Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager to escalate.
On the other hand, as a diplomat suggests, "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war, persists.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, and some filming days planned in Sarajevo were transferred to Hungary at short notice.
In the meantime, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Female War Victims wrote to Jolie about the UN Refugee Relief Agency UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador of the UN Refugee Relief Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
There had been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, their organization has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, gave a filming permit for Sarajevo after a while - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, that she has worked hard in the Yugoslavia conflict, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, it remains vague in terms of content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the internet, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other in it even before the outbreak of war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds considerably different from the variant "rape victims fall in love with torturers".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that's for sure.
According to Jolie, the pressure on her is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now it seems that only the hackers of Hollywood can bring her peace: by putting the script on the internet illegally, as so many have done before.
Let's get out of here
This evening it is finally going really well again for the Irish.
There's no sign of distress.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans rejoice with loud music, they stomps with their feet.
The Bailey-Pub in Cork in southern Ireland is shaking because the players throw table tennis balls over a three meter distance into beer cups - and hit.
"Beer Pong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 Euro win bonus plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself by distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
On his plan is not fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a queasy feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and yet I don't have any work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had her wishful job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanners' three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, according to experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a sharp loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly disturbing for the young, well-trained Irish, for whom uphill conditions have so far only been possible.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under thirty are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from the readers of young emigrants who complain: "Everything goes down in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one will turn off the light, please."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future coming because the government is only blinding and offers young people no more prospects.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes her fellow students swinging from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on the topic of working abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
Photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada on his website.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known what it feels like to build something somewhere else for six months.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they're moving up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely sees his home, because he makes extra shifts in order to be able to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, when he first stepped across the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm almost never again."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros four years ago - 100 percent financed by credit.
"It was crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan ponders for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have any children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start anew."
The civil engineer does not like the wailing he often hears at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe that makes us feel Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just see how life goes elsewhere.
He's been working in London for a few years and why shouldn't New Zealand be doing well for him and his girlfriend?
But there is still one thing that worries him quite a lot these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it could turn into a goodbye party.
"Just don't get too much emotion," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Farewell, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a away party, easy, with some friends, some drinks, some games."
The Democatric Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is growing stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These were the results of the Latinobarómetro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly noticeable in this year's survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of supporters of democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend is also evident in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp slump last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see diagram 2).
About 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust their country's Congress and 45% of their government. Both figures are the same as last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts to increase democracy.
The fact that this continued during the global economic crisis may be due to the fact that Latin American countries have only experienced a short period of recession and have recovered rapidly.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only marginally in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more noticeable and violent crimes have increased.
Only for the second time since the start of the survey do many respondents in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been the victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the figures have fallen to the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economies: about 71% of respondents across-regionally stated that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see diagram 6).
Around 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared with 11% last year).
On the other hand, respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the US as the most influential country, with Venezuela taking on this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An election slopp
No one expected the elections in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But the facts far surpassed the fears of the campaigners who rushed to the aid of the troubled country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot papers in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless due to the January earthquake, wandered around in search of a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded that the election results be lifted due to an alleged fraud.
There were partly violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election as "very good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected runoff is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no support among the voters, declares the election judge to be the winner of the runoff election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for the election were not yet issued.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves share the same view.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after your husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, the highest value since her election in 2007.
Whether this will help her to re-election next year, however, depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who guided economic policy even after his wife’s election, often drew up budget plans that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further discord.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian slapped another's face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I won't discuss it," the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money at his own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it will probably grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction its main objectives, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then embellished the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
It has called on the private sector and trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined the growth boost by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is customary elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" for the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after her term of office has ended even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which largely has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacations in March, the wave of sympathies brought to her will have faded.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether or not to quietly pick up many of her husband's political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching closer ties with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the strait?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters, went to elect mayors and city councillors in the five districts, which is considered to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By establishing ground-breaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with China’s mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only a short time.
Although its Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes, while the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, the usual events in Taiwan were such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-swibbing mass parades and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious attempt at murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, made a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator was killed.
More bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which gave the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to focus on its relations with the Beijing government.
But this time the DPP avoided too much fuelling the anti-Chinese feelings.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, would like to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese are in favour of his China policy.
The Beijing Government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly it also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It prefers to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
In the meantime, the DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fights for the votes of the professionals and youth.
Tsai was very popular as a candidate for the presidency of the DPP, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that she too is able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea-maker as a point of contact between the DPP and China. This, however, presupposes unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's hasty rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said that the DPP candidates had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP struggles to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma's values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reshape his cabinet and local institutions.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only a limited supporter of rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no turning back."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the Year
If you act at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year’s Grammy in the category Newcomer of the Year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a little unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules according to which an artist may have released a maximum of three albums before the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Her ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her lively voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings comes closest.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbing favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where otherwise more albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category large group. He thus takes on the Billy Childs Emble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to South California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category Berg's "Lulu by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen at Disney Hall on January 4th.
The 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category instrumental solo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he had written the 15-minute piece especially for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the category of orchestral performance for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
This year, only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Accux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classical Crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Temecula Valley Islamic Centre on Thursday morning.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the voices on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore," said a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at an end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented with a water filter manufacturer.
The new mosque of approx. 2,300 m2 in Mediterranean style will have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is a sign in their view that life is possible even without the elements previously considered necessary for life.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it very special, even though it is almost a kind of 'foreign' way of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which will be published in the online edition of Science on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California's Mono Lake continues to grow even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"One wonders what else is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, says Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details on the discovery were disclosed gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements, and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that one element can be replaced by another in basic biochemical processes and structures," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake due to its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, it assumed that microbes exposed to both may replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic has a different effect than phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it smears almost everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, showing that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but there has been no working example yet.
Arsenic occurred more frequently in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently from the early Earth age," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express Van, in which the animals were accommodated in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is the dogs are well," says Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide any precise information about the location of the dogs nor about the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to say more about this," explains Whitmore.
"We're following a few tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed according to the authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was to take part in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the couple's almost one-month tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 on Tuesday.
Peek promised anyone who could give an indication of the corgis a finder's fee. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's fee would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "preparatory" believer plan to pay off $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new films and television shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. currency law, so that nothing stands in the way of the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will lead the somewhat slimmed-down studio as general manager.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself contributes $75 million, manages the company. Financing is expected to stand until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to help investment bank Moelis & Co, the management, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year, to solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Dougnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to resolve MGM's financial concerns and pay off the studio's more than 140 believers took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started all over again when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
If MGM has officially survived bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The stake for Moelis & Co., who have already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who has been paid $375,000 a month for the management of the Company, will receive a $4 million "success bonus".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume the production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after "Der kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of $265 million to $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which are to be made under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gadgets can rip a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force, and this year the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, the most famous of these, Web Kinz and Club Penguin, is a wider offer.
More and more button-cell powered toys are coming onto the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs, who sing a note when you press on their belly.
Pressing once is equal to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can't stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers swap games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinged feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're a kid of the '80s, you're sure to remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a better-knower with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which according to Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8 onwards).The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about merging the blocks into words before time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling contest.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the toy shops, web kinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the Code Online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of clots.
And he can take a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived for some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are becoming gentler
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked over an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, giving orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust city order guards, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their propensity to violence - to impress the audience.
"Stand straight!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely growing out of teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair with blue-white striped bows.
"For me, they look on average," notes Mr. Tang disparagingly.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the greyish green one.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low staring: in 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled around a misplaced snack truck and stared at the operator until he packed up and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the urban police patrols. They have been selected specifically for their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are supposed to give the vicious police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly so, according to the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce the city laws by fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officers in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death when he filmed her with his cell phone beating down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon merchant suffered brain injuries after a handshake with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street traders.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleanup".
Skeptics feel that the current approach is clearly inadequate.
In October, when the Distrik reportedly searched for eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real tasks or should only serve as visual distractions.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women between the ages of 18 and 22 were sought with a good figure and "harmonious facial features".
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to the officials, the work is too physically demanding for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image," said an unnamed district official on the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's municipal administration, does not wish to endorse this description.
However, it admitted that in China size specifications are not uncommon in job advertisements for both sexes.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is equivalent to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical deformities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lame or hunchbacks here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrolates on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple biscuits and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel that sexist, so much emphasis was placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the short attitude, as they would have more ambitious career plans than simply scrambling traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the patrol deals with about twelve street traders who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle before being chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've told you so many times," explains Ms. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen, which had been fixed on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than exhausting.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals by reporting them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rioted after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were knocked down or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, contrary to the regulations.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers with a grim face made their way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male patrol coordinator, remained behind, turning his white name tag around to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes, but also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
"Most of the time, people start fighting."
Prosecution won't charge Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Department of Justice acquit Senator John Ensign of the charges against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to get her husband to lobby, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which caused headlines nationwide and dampened his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
Senator Ensign's office announced that he was "very pleased" with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's ethics committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been terminated and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails, and other material disclosed for the first time in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, helped to make lucrative assignments to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was a treasurer during the Ensign election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over Hampton's lobbying after hiring them.
As Hampton was recently on Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to lobby for a year for his former employer or the entire Senate.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on revolving door lobbyism.
According to the published evidence, "it seems to be a collusion and a violation of the revolving door statutes," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Department of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the ministry seemed very cautious in taking political charges after a variety of defeats that were followed with great interest by the media, including last year's decision to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously frightful," said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in US parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to justice.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another one the next day that he was told that the ministry would not bring any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, the senator had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I don't think I'm going to go into the conversation details between the Department of Justice and me. Just so much to say: we think we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to close the investigation into a separate lawsuit filed by the Ethics Group that resulted in a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons in violation of the Federal Electoral Act.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that for a long time supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that after Mr. Hampton's company moved on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was "anklopfe" to the Interior Department about a matter.
Mr. Ensign also met with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Transport Minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after the latter had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
Last year, when information about this affair came to the public for the first time, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth among Republicans.
After he hadn't noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigation, his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hoped that the Ethics Commission would very quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and stop its investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire Call Draws Attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them typed away in the riots in the courtroom.
In a minute, they sent their reports on gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape and bed chained children trial in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the verdict on the death sentence pronounced by the jury comes to an end.
However, Mr. Haye's lawyers have already filed petitions in court that state the reasons for an appeal and that the courts will deal with for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – has resulted in a "circus atmosphere" and such widespread, immediate penetration of insurgent details, so that the jury has been unduly influenced by public indignation.
This objection could lead the Courts of Appeal to consider whether new technologies would make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"Just as I experienced during this trial, I believe it is a real danger that the entry of new technologies into the courtroom will affect everyone's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's main defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, rejected the applications by decision last week, when he said that the New Media would be "carefully controlled" and that there would be no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its 1966 historic decision, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who is said to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media.
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court appeals that consider Mr. Haye's conviction half a century later may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in trials being pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some courthouses might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many that Mr. Hayes' lawyers set out to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have been prejudged when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the jurors' selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her confidant, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge had mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he had unduly put pressure on the verdict when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a trial they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotion over the case.
"One such day-to-day crowd of media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "was not experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide."
Her focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more intrusive than reports that are being reported more slowly is an anti-technological look that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
But some lawyers said that court appeals were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their appeal, they referred to the ruling of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was lifted due to the reporting and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can politeness connect the separating?
After a campaign of swearing and negativity, little courtesy broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before one quickly returns to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not bring a breakthrough on the major issues that had to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no decisions were taken.
After all that is heard, it was not a polite discussion between two sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan score.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that persist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that masks the ideological divide that continues to separate members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - one of which calls for the other sign of willingness to cooperate and compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to be expected to change the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November election voted Washington mildly for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse party passions that die again.
And that's a good thing."
On some issues, especially those on the "lame duck session" agenda, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all of them, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, even if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe the favored tax cuts for the rich while denying support to unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, the optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of Brookings Insituation warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of lame duck session" does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that politeness leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from now until 2012, as a prelude, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters whose formation served.
However concerned the Republican leaders may be that they are playing too high a poker, they know that they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and override health reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Vice-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan the official recommendation and they are fighting very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, because in financial matters, at least today, there is little scope or sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes, and health system, later followed by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must be careful about the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanism and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and Congress Republicans than President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a far wider election in 2012.
From this point of view, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that still separate the two.
Leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of the "cleptocracy" and it passes on part of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the American embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are extorting high levels of protection so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, they say.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "verticals of authority" - takes its share of the money that the leaders go up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his homepage on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that in the meantime had been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous slander charges against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when he was asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, as polls have shown.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the Ambassador's report, individual persons are called, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between Moscow's government and crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and to conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo says.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends over the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Inspectorate (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is the top priority."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Last of all, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city offers no help whatsoever."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is collecting money from the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, so called, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, criminal gang protection is no longer as much in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has talked about fighting corruption several times, but at the same time he has noted that he has made little progress.
The message memo contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Inden, a Moscow expert commission, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Across the country, it is estimated that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The unveiling of the memo of the American embassy, which happened after Moscow late evening, will certainly cause displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's mistakes, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Confront the Past
In a poorly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds of the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge reign known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the government, long-standing supporters in Anlong Veng are challenged.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells children of former soldiers the story of Khmer Rouge for the first time.
And in July, a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge for the first time when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society more difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It itself divides families."
During Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary waged the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told representatives of the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced labourers probably died.
One hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court charged more suspects, although experts and historians are discussing this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center said.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means collecting the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so that as everything can understand."
The centre created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek mountains, a path overgrown by shrubs and covered with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tires.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here are going to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will drop a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to accumulate non-weaponable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the Belarus government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But officials of the U.S. government told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus were made to remove 187 pounds of weapons-capable uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - according to an official staff member who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's April "Nuclear Security Summit of 47 Nations" that excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Safety Summit (2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important and important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"We keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"That's our raw material... we're not gonna make dirty bombs out of it, and we're not gonna sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus nevertheless approached the US a few months ago when it indicated interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, official say.
It was loaded into a special train that for more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the officials.
The US government is paying $14 million for this effort, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research using low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust" which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the USA have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
"Welcomeing the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections of the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as indicated by a telegram from the U.S.A. Ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents enveloped by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former deputy head of government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which the aid to practices derogating from human rights was charged in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the Council's report "had met Zapatero on the sidelines" affirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed", in order not to be "unprepared to be surprised", reports Aguirre via cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little scope for influence, since it is in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Secretary of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly manage between governments," Aguirre laments.
At a luncheon in March 2007, attended by the US Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were insanely concerned about their independence and would do what they considered appropriate," he had given instructions to his staff "to avoid inflated rhetorical comments in order to let the tension falter."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from a hint that the government of Zapatero's actions, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, will tolerate or deliberately ignore, will capitalize, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the USA," he emphasizes.

Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex-husband never let him do a DNA analysis.
Soon after, she started a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages it can be concluded that their love relationship broke up and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he liked it, but now of course he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to be able to do and leave what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th, because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that if everything goes well, she will take her firstborn with her.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with anyone but my mother again", a dubious intention if one considers their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes these, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the first of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
"On the one hand, he is with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A big kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. See, if he wants to, he'll find me, such crap."
On the 30th another: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there's one: "He's shooting money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and manga logs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now blocked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison releaser."
"Terror a la gallega (Heading) ".
The last man to live with her, a sworn hunting overseer, says he has a bit of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred from the Prisoner of Justice Centre in Menorca to the Palma Provincial Prison yesterday.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the facts, "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before that, however, she confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and storing his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following the significant increase in the number of votes and Members of Parliament in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing on the parliamentary elections - either in advance or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this rising tendency - the result of the redirection of the PSC's vote and the attachment of the PP's electorate - should continue, the PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congressmen, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one Member - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its Member or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be May 2011. Even then, the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scales to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with their majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists cannot achieve a majority or resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd for this party to lose its representation on the Barcelona municipal council, where it would have to win 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona’s upheaval, where they ruled together with the PP in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
En Lérida has the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party also recorded a significant increase.
Currently, PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the police from the Barcelona Police Station formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter author of the attacks in Bombay, which claimed 106 deaths in 2008 - provided passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which go so far as to assure that "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" Al Qaida's forgery apparatus worldwide and "so with its ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups that made up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impunity.
The exposed cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also been involved in the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that similar attacks on the territory of the EU will occur in the next few days, such as the one carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, during which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
From Bangkok, they had led the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - stole passports from tourists in particular according to the guidelines of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued in the name of men aged 25 to 45 years and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigative circles point out that up to now no links between those arrested in Catalonia and the assassination attempt in Bombay have been found, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack from Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent by means of a money transfer company, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", which put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police confiscated an extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone the tax agreement
Yesterday, the chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity to personally present Artur Mas her conditions in support of his taking office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These do not differ from those already made during the election campaign and can be summed up with the priority of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement which the regionalist leader intends to propose at the height of his mandate.
The chairman of the Catalan People's Party certainly turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 MPs she had won last Sunday - a number that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining from voting when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible Entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the party chairmen of the PPC are concerned, the PPC demands that, in support of taking office, "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on financial compensation between the state and the autonomous region - similar to that in the Basque country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to subject to a referendum, be put behind.
Both political leaders agree that they want to slim down the uplifted political apparatus of the regional administration and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat deal with the details of the negotiations for the inauguration of Mas.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not rule out the fact that their caretaker killed over eleven elderly people
The leaders of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they found out what harm the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the nurse who had killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible - had done to the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to sue the person responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution not only has to accept a loss of social standing because it had not detected the criminal acts of the caretaker in time, but now also pays a high compensation amount, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has continued to murder.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and illnesses.
La Caritat's head denied this point, saying that "outgoing action could never have been the cause of the incidents."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no evidence in the lawsuit of negligent acts of any person other than the accused."
The man already confessed to eleven murders as the "Angel of Death" the day before yesterday and declared that he had committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and that he had murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The director of La Caritat said that the access of staff to the medicines was difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail were used by the nurse in six out of nine crimes committed in order to free the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila was lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it from the inside by giving them bleaching liquor, as he confessed to three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the statements of the caretaker, not even in terms of the number of committed murders, which could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made it available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threatening gestures of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The risk premiums of the euro-peripheral countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself and that the euro has hardly gained points of concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which recovers as it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear by a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which tomorrow, for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future, the ECB must withdraw.
The Bundesbank demanded that the plan to buy sovereign debt be terminated as it was ineffective, as well as that all exceptional temporary liquidity measures be lifted. Only one week of unlimited access should be maintained.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly invitations to tender with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity to be maintained until at least June.
We also expect that the program to buy bonds will continue and issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of yesterday's markets will be thrown back and if we insist on withdrawing our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, at which the Bank reiterated that it would not consider buying government debt securities and that the markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
State asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, Portugal's interest rates fell by 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a change in market perception, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures for the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The sum is estimated to be about 10 000 million in the short term and a possible further 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost credibility after not recognizing the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to obtain parliamentary approval for its new budget and, as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven's ninth symphony.
The Spanish President of the Government presented yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of the government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explain why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which is why we are relying on strong demand that will remove all doubts about our debt rescheduling capacity.
For Spain, applying for a help plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need; the Treasury has EUR 40 billion at its disposal, three times as much as in March; interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now not only being matters, but also appearances."
Courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Owls contests the shareholders' meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fail.
David Álvarez, founder of the company Gurppe, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not appear to be willing to give in to its dispute over the control of El Enebro's institutions.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The General Meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the commercial court number 2 of Madrid for the 16th, triggered a new thunderbolt in the lap of the Álvarez family.
Invoking the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the general meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as "a desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have legal sensitivities, fraudulent activities and abuse of rights recognized by the annulled 18 January Assembly", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for contesting the Assembly in hindsight to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who hide themselves in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
That is the real background to the case on which the judge has to decide at the hearing to deal with the appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved in real time with software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been marked by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe of speed.
At first, nobody paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last season, they all put on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso at the final sprint last November.
Without wanting to reduce the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in its hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This computer program called PLM was used for the development of assembly chains in factories all over the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial department, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements found on the races and in the tests can be designed and executed.
Russwurm states that in 1992 an average of ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
Today, in Red Bull's team, 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful computer equipment, they carry out analyses and any possible changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of the Red Bull racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula One team is allowed to spend on its race in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and production of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
There are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula One hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer places in the service of his participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose awareness is zero.
Steve Nevey, the plant's chief technologist, points out that five years ago it was still possible to say that the progress in the field of R&D contributed to the victory for racing cars with 50 percent and that the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, share values have changed, accounting for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDP, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open its own shops with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty shops, each measuring between 80 and 100 square meters, which Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-Chair of HP España, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted shop on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mr. Herrera did not want to betray the forthcoming reopenings, but did not rule out Madrid being the next destination.
The vice-chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of shop opening is always the same. She relies on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises on this and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of shopkeepers.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales network was intended to "optimise the customer service and advice of small and micro enterprises in purchasing and after that, even packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro enterprises as well as private customers, because large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal one million customers from his rivals in three years' time
The managing board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in interest margins, which banks are trying to offset with increases in the fees and prices of loans.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years' time - a subject that still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year roadmap in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without making use of public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if the customers that the bank will lose - which is the major challenge facing this bank, as it has so far paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has added 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual report.
Only a few banks dare to set targets and publish them in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all the banks’ plans worldwide.
This year, Sabadell will complete its Optima roadmap, which was established four years ago, initially for three years, but was extended by one year as a result of the market situation.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
During a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain will only be "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - which penalises the interest margins - will falter, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks have to pay for their issues in order to preserve liquidity are already passed on to the price of loans to compensate for dwindling profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the tap off, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto issued an order to its branch network to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the stategy of "increasing the fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures us that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"Everything will change in the coming year," he assures.
It stresses that the need for capital is currently "increasing" and does not rule out some Spanish financial institutions slipping into red figures.
He believed that the FROB could replace the money market in the event of captita runs.
After confirming that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but unlike the events in June, short-term financing could be obtained through repo transactions and thus the crisis could be resolved.
CECA excludes a second wave of mergers between savings banks
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that a wave of mergers between savings banks could occur and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not want to participate in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured us that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed; the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, but rather as adjustments."
"Most of it is completed. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, so we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta stated that "there are a number of untroubled opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed unbelief and nonsense," because "Banco de España exhorts us to complete on time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" around the world, adding that those who doubted would do so "without any deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic cycle, we must "not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very important" process of concentration that will be carried out "as quickly as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to retain the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
Market tensions have triggered a dual response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary work companies or the abolition of the 426 euro support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, this is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes on a fundamentally new perspective for shaping our future, which clashes with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although that sounds more like science fiction at the moment - , supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third is a restructuring of the euro according to German proposals, which means more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; penalisation of countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the cessation of payments by some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled a constitutional reform off its sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the drifting apart between what Germany considered necessary (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was set by the Central European country when Merkel painfully pushed out the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the published opinion were absolutely against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel has come out again with a clear position in the last few days of October, calling for reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country to be saved while at the same time obliging private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, driving the Irish crisis and all the following.
However, their proposal, albeit a little sweeter, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It says to everyone that, even if unpopular measures need to be taken now, the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area, in which the countries that are opposed to it will be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent and, in this case, the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to take a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as led by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we'd do a bad thing not to understand.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will be more calm.
And that we will make use of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has paved its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like anything would change.
Among the possibilities that have been considered is that we should leave the euro area, which is full of little serious countries, not to be excluded.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show ingenuity, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The supposed exclusion of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed on whether it was an unsportsmanlike act or not and whether both players might be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls for the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will comply with the prescribed penalty in the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules, but in this sport it is followed.
Part of the debate about the case presented is due to the fact that a team from the Real Madrid football club (who, in his anthem, pretended to be noble and honorable and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the leading role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long story than theatrical and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this practice, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a rule bypass. Indeed, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to the sporting spirit should be investigated.
The sport spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the opposing players get an unjustified benefit from the counter-team. Nor did this happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually mean by false play or rule avoidance, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and happily accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders derived from the deliberate fouls.
It should be pointed out here that the rival was not placed in a less favourable position, nor was there any advantages for the game being played, as the obvious result of this action was that his own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, to a certain degree uncertain advantage, since the team could eventually also withdraw. Furthermore, players with this approach receive a sanction and move into the second card cycle, in which they withdraw less than in the first cycle due to the accumulation of cards with one card.
So it is not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions in order to maximise the benefits of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent any sanction (this would actually be a clear case of rule avoidance), they wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or escaping punishment.
Although the boundary between inventiveness and the rule environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemics came about as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer campaign to catch customers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
This year, the dictatorship of the calendar is dropping an avalanche of reservations on the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas Lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season that supply oxygen to the restaurant and leisure sector in Barcelona. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive in order to capture the customer segment, which is the big crowd: Almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To make accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) dropped all orders in the week of December 13th, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinner on two top days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, the lowest prices are demanded, confirms Gaietà Farràs, chairman of the Bar Board of Barcelona.
So far, the representative of the umbrella organisation has not dared to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it a million times before they make reservations."
"They want to go out, but they pay great attention to prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants it turns out that the evening of 17 December leads the providers to collapse.
The Soteras group says that the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros are booming. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, one does not lose optimism after income has blossomed again since the second quarter and good prospects for the Christmas business, although focused on a few days, are being looked at.
Sources of the Group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menus as price hit. It seems that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than last year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Some companies also see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back on the rise.
On the part of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "live" overall, although the customers "make a maximum".
However, the fun of celebrating has not declined, no matter who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Wikileak revelations confirm Taliban-Pakistan relations.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the edge of the clarifying and succulent details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries is not being strengthened in terms of nuclear security, but is on the contrary "decreasing", and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
Especially the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in a possible attack - make Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are listed in a report by the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, prior to the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the Taliban-attacked area, the likely dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer regarded by the US, but also by Russia as being rampant and reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan must hire strict religious personnel to guard nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan is diminishing in terms of nuclear proliferation and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", declares: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic catastrophe Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit by General Ashfaq Kayani, the Chief of the Army, to "clarify" the person responsible that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit over-support for terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high-ranking leader in the fight against terrorism to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning about tracking and finding Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" on Assange's "discovery and persecution."
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million US diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of Wikileaks' founder, Mark Stephens, states that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
Already on the 20th the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities obtained the authority.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and locate Assange "to arrest and deliver him for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organisation, many Member States regard the red warning as a release letter for detention - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is probably staying.
The action outraged Assange's lawyers who published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for an exit from Sweden and was approved by the prosecutor, who was compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief of Security of Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is accused in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia asserts the innocence of her son - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indeterminate location. During the interview, he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the request to resign "spicy and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking leader in the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama’s spokesman to pay less attention to Assange is in contrast to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of adding Wikileaks to the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate their funds and to prosecute anyone who supports them or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "murdered".
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and everything that is not an execution is too mild a punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the General Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid, for the tenth time, an internal turmoil in the ranks of the ERCs, which, after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes, have no direction.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for those close to former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win over the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For starters, it was announced yesterday that the more than 200 ERC regional council members could make secret statements about his remaining in office.
With ballots, not a raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to give the president a ticket, they could do so without fearing reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he affirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half the votes plus one, and he added without giving any percentages that a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod people demand more from the president than just making his office available to the party, an insufficient gesture because Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to push for resignations, they will agree with the board on a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which will be submitted to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, he is to promise to bring the Congress forward in the autumn of 2011, which the party leadership already considers to be a fact.
The ERC leader believes that the "polyphony" is detrimental to stability and he strives once and for all to get the organization to be able to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by incumbent Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it to be a fact that the party chairman is supported "in exchange for various goals".
He listed five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the General Assembly principle as a way of working.
In doing so, he defends a reform of the statutes, which should allow the congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcercós' team is obsessed with ending the plenary assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - which was already fighting for it at the last two congresses.
In fact, at the 2008 quaking assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the general assembly principle at a congress that was to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as infogle's internal recovery in recent years was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors lying in wait, the time may have come to take up this matter again and to end it forever.
23 Murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the census of MILENIO, México recorded four cases less than in 2010.

In the middle of the month, two men were reported to have been killed, wrapped in blankets and found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza. In addition to the victims, two death threats were also found.
One day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th two dead women wrapped in blankets were discovered in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning in Huixquilucan the corpse of a man, probably named Mario Ríos, wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, was found.
In the San Francisco Acuautla settlement of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman with bullets in her neck was found.
Tattoos by Santa Muerte and chains with corresponding illustrations were discovered on the woman's skin.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with tape and a message were discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was a message probably signed by a criminal organization saying, "This is what happens to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet with traces of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the San Agustín judicial centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been decapitated in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and tied in black plastic bags, there was a message next to it. The second had been tortured and was found in the streets of the settlement of Juárez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard box with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
At COP16, China’s representative said that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and maintained its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is offering to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured his country that he had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He stated that over the last four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he said that China would not change its goals, but would work on this issue together with the international community.
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
He said that progress had been made in all aspects, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Act, which included the objectives of reducing the emission of gases.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, state authorities had cooperated with those of the central government and municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
He also carried out, started or completed several years of plans, both those funded by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced over the past five years and which has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a provincial project on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs and another on mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government advisor on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts are far greater than is commonly expected.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tons per person, while in the United States they were 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent in the last five years and another is expected to happen by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist party leader had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right was for him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party leader of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right was for him.
In an interview held prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's appeal as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espino was a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"In his case, Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said, it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge strengthened from the internal vote on the coming 4 and 5 December, when his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman, the Acción Nacional, for the next three years. Therefore, it would pass the Stafette "to those whom the Council would determine."
"I'm not concerned about it, I'd be proud to be the party's chairman for each of the five."
He predicted that the party's upswing in the last elections of July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's time to support Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa were carrying the flag and being watched throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the demands."
When he was questioned about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón's discourse in the context of his four-year government, César Nava called on PRI's supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he affirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government would be able to make expressions such as those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no ban on speaking and even less censorship.
Obama advocates the law in favor of undocumented students in Twitter
"If you're in favour of passing the Dream Act, then call your senators and push for the passing of this law," tweeted the president of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act - law to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social web Twitter.
"If you're in favour of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the passing of that law," Obama tweeted.
His short notice contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to contact their senators in an inferior manner, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all vote for each law, except for the expansion of tax reductions from the Bush era and the funding of the government would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockade of Republicans under the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on this at any time, and then we can plan the rest," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law, with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who migrated to the United States when they were less than sixteen years old, lived in that country for the last five years and were enrolled in a higher educational institution or army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organisations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans to their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had advocated the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate faces the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust of Language' was a walk, during which the participants made themselves strong for the narrative
"I understand the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was supposed to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentinean scriptwriter sweetly spit out to the audience, composed mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz then identified as a great narrative. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is and goes from doctor to doctor, of which she receives no answer, but hints for the guide of her narrative.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the corridor, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst discovers the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called 'Praise for invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back far-travelled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story turned around and told of America, the great novel that did not lack its own chronicler from the beginning, and he quotes Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination that even lost the sense of shame."
However, he points out that "it is the madmen and liars who imagine things best", and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows to which side the narrative belongs, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is being told."
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the FIL to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence affecting her country - like the whole of Latin America - as a result of the struggle for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not intentional intentional commitment," she explained after highlighting that literature is communication and commitment that build up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer" hevorhob.
He noticed that in a fast-moving world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness also run out on dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we have to nuance: and nuances often mean putting a finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noted and invited to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final, there are also two different styles set by their respective coaches, and their encounter marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has made himself the second champion with the medal, he has been one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played with the same team consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist reached the first final as coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he experienced a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he achieved the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a setback again, since the game was undecided with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to take his title, but in the end three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted by misfortune again and free himself from the evil spell in order to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, this is for a club, for my affection, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," commented the helmsman when asked about the lost finals.
The last final game has remained strong in his memory, he assures that he has learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared at the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared with two penalty points to leave, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shooting does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at penalty shooting, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce effort to hold the title in our hands, that left us something for this final game, and we hope that it will not happen this time."
It is in Romanso's power not to be only second champion and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring with them.
The United States amends the rules for obtaining a visa
Before talking to the consulate, people must present themselves at the visa application service points and costs will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the visa application service points (ASC, the initial letters in English) prior to their conversation at the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment, processing the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counter to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only wish to extend their visa do not have to have a conversation at the consulate, they only have to imagine at the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are collected at the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation at the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service supplement of 26 dollars.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembasy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aerospace Agency (NASA) announced tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science that investigates the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory find for the search for alien life", which led to speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it can exist in hostile environments, which were previously thought to be uninhabitable, human-like creatures. The hypothesis was raised that if their living conditions improved, they could turn into intelligent beings, like humans.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment considered too toxic to all life forms, as the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances are increased that there might be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, astrobiologists have shown that "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that is different from what we know."
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its find at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan ( Saturn's largest moon) on the question of whether its chemical composition resembles that of the Earth.
Gestapo PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
The reform of the Organs Act on Congress introduces the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislative term had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, was already installed.The four questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Before the introductory session of the 60th legislative term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo weathered against the reform of the organ law, as this would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, for now it would be two people, the same number as parties controlling Congress.
These four members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Bureau, in his capacity as vice-chairman, led by the Panists Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties institutionally introduced their political marginality with these reforms.
He explained that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, starting from their political will, and if they did not, they would be subjugated by both parties, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"So far I come to this (the opposition coalition), that's what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, they don't even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there was agreement with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
"For the beginning, this group starts with five members of parliament and they talk to other colleagues to make them more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT stated, in allusion to PAN and PRI, that the Congress has now turned into a 'return' for two.
"Previously it was only one party, now they divide it into twos."
Patrón Montalvo requested that MEPs be respected and that they be given their place at the negotiating tables.
"It must not be left out because of top-level decisions, which are likely to be nine Members. The five, which are currently seen as split up into different political groups, have decided to unite in order to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of it reform, which was carried out and agreed by the others, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 pesos more for "the supplier"
Mazatlán Municipality pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year amounts to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued to an amount of 200,144.56 peso with the number 9258447 was issued last November 16 with the purpose of "accounting open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent forward that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to it and, consequently, the number of cheques still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, two of October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and the last of November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is called into question by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on 25 July the examination of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it became known that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had already paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need to be improved infiltration
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and which cast a bad image on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, recalled that on various occasions it was called upon to maintain the tourist destination and turn the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and sidewalks had had a negative effect, as tourists would wander and see the disorder, and they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day, and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction work slowly and planlessly."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must take on its responsibility and avoid something like this happening again. How should it do this? Well, by means of preventive maintenance, instead of repairing everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions constantly in check," he added.
"Not enough attention has been paid to these arrangements, and this kind of incident exposes what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist sites of Mazatlán because they were not used properly and created a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that should be brought to the fore together with the city. Making the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that need to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism and to provide them with the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business sector demands a worthy parliament, free from collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is agitated and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated, composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and another from PVEM, making a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do clean work, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, proposed that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right to act free of collusion between the parties, because it is customary for them to enter into agreements with which they represent their own interests, transforming them into carnival comparists of the governments and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the hotel association Tres Islas, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is to drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he asked the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary status in the state budget in order to promote it.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second least means. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment to the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourism projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, must be brought up to date.
Holy King is wanted
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family long for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
On the next Epiphany day, it will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes, for the household is no more and no less than composed of twelve persons and one goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no firm work.
"Sometimes tough times are happening because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out to the street with the brats for sale," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
For some time now, ten-year-old José Alfredo has wanted to have a 'monster car' and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús Cayetana proposes clothes in size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I'd love to have this monster,' but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana sadly remembered.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaía is the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel is the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you would like to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King Wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the lobby of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, around ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people were arrested and will be confronted with various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, where the majority of the people were said to have served as drug producers.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke who were considered to be the main wire puller of the drug ring.
The arrested persons were reported to have appeared in front of the justice building in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could be charged, among other things, with accusing the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation, which lasted for over a year.
"The information received from the public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel specified.
Around 70 police officers from the regional investigation unit Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
The clandestine immigration could easily be prosecuted
The Conservatives' draft law, which, according to the government, is supposed to deal with the problem of ships loaded with clandestine immigrants, will probably be embroiled after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I hold with a party that has put shackles on your feet," said Michael Ignatief, head of the Liberals, at the end of the weekly Caucus meeting in front of the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows for up to one year to hold any person who is identified as a ship for the transport of illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he was unable to support the bill as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," explained M. Duceppe.
Criticism regarding the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has turned away the critics who claim that their party was not steadfast enough against the clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and that is what we are trying to do by mediating another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We are therefore not in favour of the Conservatives' bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least a year," said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the Canadians' will.
"The Canadians strongly inform the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and that treat the country as a tramp."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenney.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its draft law, which could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a conservative has said to the QMI agency that the government would call a vote so that every opposition MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unity does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible establishment of a new standing unit to fight corruption and collusiveness, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public committee of inquiry on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was also not lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "a rabbit cast out of the hat" and "a solution made at the end of a table".
In turn, Minister Dutil had turned to those who fear that political power would have too much influence on the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he contented himself with affirming.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public poll.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means of forming a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a lecturer in ethics and political systems at the ENA (National College for the Training of Senior Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this impasse, he suggests that Quebec should be given a specific mandate to audit the financial situation so that it can investigate corruption and collusion.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give audit control the same authority as Commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal law in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected the motorcycle police groups, 131 people had been arrested, although the penal law had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has been pouring in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide had taken place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has sunk into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains from 40 to 70 millilitres of precipitation poured into several regions.
Between 20 to 40 millimeters of precipitation were expected here, according to the regions, until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
Up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen here.
Since snowmelt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is still to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm on the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentinian mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the crossing of several lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was demolished due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Security continues to be alerted and closely monitors the situation, said Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec State Flood Centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially reproved
The Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians as well as for his inconvenient speech over radio.
The CCNR believes that although M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own views, certain statements "have contained inaccurate information about the social welfare and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians, and also such a rude way of speaking that is not appropriate for the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the Broadcasting Code.
The CCNR received several complaints concerning the comments made during the programmes broadcast in 2008 and 2010.
The first order was filed following a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The facilitators should provide solid rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" programme in question had raised a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not accused of any reprimand towards his person.
The last point of dispute was the statements that related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had had a media-effective dispute in this regard that had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he had not donated in favor of Haiti's aid, as one would not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not of an abusive nature, but that their cumulative effect represented an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already lost my three-day suspension sentence on this matter."
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," the moderator explained.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of unsophisticated language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted "beyond his obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, among other things, had to communicate his decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing as well as in Thai boxing, now rises in the search for new challenges on the Tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
"I started martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
Personally, I am looking for the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fight as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the security officer and UPS employee had given bad news to his rivals, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China."
"The fighters from each category had been invited, who had placed among the top four at the last World Cup."
"I brought Babe bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 I became eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished fifth in the tournament in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto," he added.
"It is worth noting that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating from China in which punches and kicks as well as ground throws are permitted.
The matches usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer who emerged from this kind of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal were to retain only one event in his career, he would surely call his presence here "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest-ranking and most respected in China," explained the sympathetic Pfundskerl.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro," he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category stand up to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without invitation to tender
Hydro-Québec has, by mutual agreement, granted project planning companies $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts stands a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, known as "Energie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a companion to Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over its responsibility to the private sector to this important hydroelectric project to the tune of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of competition repression and price increases.
"This is a new way of playing a mapped game and defusing the competition."
"This means that instead of playing cards, they are now performing them in an open form, rather than in a secret way," said Sylvain Simard, MP of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems to him difficult to understand how public interest can be served in this way.
In the afternoon, Nathalie Normandeau, Minister of Resources, responded by vehemently denying that this contract was a mapped game.
"I remain true to my line," she betted, strengthening that the PQ had been "dishonestly" and that it was "lack of hardness."
She said it was "be the least" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium's model is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance of this kind, allowing two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity in terms of its workload.
The construction process is in progress and is expected to be in place by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition; negotiations had already taken place.
Moreover, the Quebec consortium model is no longer an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief flyover of the Quebec Business Register allows for the designation of more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of lasting duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, goes back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
As regards the "Energie gérance" consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Bay of James is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has raised the nose about the fact that the contract for project management was approved by agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prizes will go up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this Mart and tell you that a satisfactory agreement will be negotiated at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," said Laporte.
This contract granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received by Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts approved between 2002 and March 2010 by companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin had acquired 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "Energie gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had reported that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had suggested that the PQ was equally connected with the companies that "financed" it before specifying that it was rather their managers.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Greener, but unwaveringly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the key players in sustainable growth, but also in the marked brands or eco-labels that are supposed to steer his choice.
It is a pity, though it is bathed in a media-effective universe, where information is teeming in favor of a more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy that is seen as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading that was held yesterday showed.
Although they have driven the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of the population of Quebec admits that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as much as green corporate advertising, as the instrument of measurement devised by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke reveals.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of official certificates attached to supposedly fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, politicians' discourse on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this segment of consumption, which is currently being stimulated by almost one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptiness and dubious character of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are suspicious of the declared performance of green products and services that they are trying to put at their disposal.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases from traders in their neighbourhoods and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64th of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as the king of recycling, who tries to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But social and ecological consciousness seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers said they had used public transport in 2010 or preferred the ride centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was asked by Société Angus and Parallèle to contribute financially to the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to return it to its real cinematic function, apparently do not receive what they have demanded.
The government has accepted to engage in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond at a lower level than initially hoped for, which could lead to a viable solution on favourable terms, at least in the opinion of sources that are detachable from the state rumor kitchen.
A first plan of action and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the petition has been revised downwards since the resuming.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris file, by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final factual report.
However, the counter-proposal of the Cabinet was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec ownership community of cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there, which he had not also given to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic assistance.
Cinema director Daniel Langlois, after the self-financed construction of the cinema, had presented the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex with great difficulty for over ten years, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele at bay.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, in turn operate a privately financed campagne, which they hope to receive a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not remove the newspaper "Le Devoir" and they ignored what he and his group thought of the downwardly corrected proposals made to them.
Mystery of the complex shaken Canada Revealed
The new American diplomatic leaderships, spread through WikiLeaks, uncover the secret of what the United Nations considers to be inferior to the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the latter's sense of superiority over Canada.
As a result, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind during the election, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more piquant details than the mere substantial content to be nibbled at.
An association dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador deployed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A complex of almost intrinsic inferiority to Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life much more than to push black Peter to the United States in this election (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The Ambassador understands this deafening silence all the less, since the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he says, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in the ballot."
The other expression of this sense of importance can be found in the statement sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, the Ottawa-based business partner, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the government's continued confidence in the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade of recovery program of $30 to $40 billion," Breese describes.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to adjourn the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the continued existence of the opposition parties in this way would have an impact on the quality of the proposed recovery programme.
Another announcement, dated January 2008, by Ambassador Wilkins, tells Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where there are little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even copies for the purpose of interrogations carried out by the CIA's muscle protégé.
Another communication reported in detail on how Hillary Clinten had asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed over to the State Secretary a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file again."
Finally, let us remember that the minds of the WikiLeaks website are heating up.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close consultant, had explained through CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed."
He had referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (CFCs), which corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented in order to stabilise the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete large-scale projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs released to the earth due to the lighting would be avoided if the white glowing pears, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better still, by light emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the major exhaust emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it would still be necessary to deduct 5 Gt from this balance in order to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white glowing pears 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
The compact fluorescent bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, while the new LED bulbs reduce this energy requirement by twice again.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by Philips this week - this company, by the way, has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white glowing bulb, suggesting the savings possibilities of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that this completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves, as they contain mercury and therefore they have to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless producers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to maintain its work and to publish the preliminary results without further delay," said a press spokesman of the UN head.
"It invites all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had missed the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue its work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, numerous calls from all over the world were made that the CEI should finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of the election under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp anticipates the cancellation of "deceiving" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN's maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's actions are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents now feel that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in the announcement of the election results as "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His allies affirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was considered to be the culmination of the unification and reconciliation process of a country divided into two parts for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians that it could be held responsible for any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of the election on 31 October with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), as shown by the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2,631 million.
Data for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% including the departments overseas.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the first quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they could be employed every two weeks or not, or whether they were seeking work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+ 0.9 percentage points over three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the inclusion of overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolitan area (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 persons over 50 years of age, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion about its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region General Council (PS), was brought under investigation and was sent to the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected of fraud markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of social assets, embezzlement of public goods, dishonesty, complicity in corruption, illegal bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to speak out on all the questions that the prosecutor's office will ask him instead of spreading fantasy."
"It is easy to submit a number of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove them," explained his lawyer Florence Rault to the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had made it important to give the judge a memoradum of justification by his lawyers before his hearing.
One of Guérini's relatives, Philippe Rafezzi, was also indicted and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he had to run.
He would never have been aware of the area of business competence or the destination of the related funds, Simon said.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also charged with embezzlement and complicity on Wednesday, but then released under judicial supervision from the protagonists of these acts.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts he was accused of."
"The senior prosecutor has considered not to deprive him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four others were charged and released from custody on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two under legal supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "unauthorised interference and passive bribery".
Two civil servants of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the grounds of the title of "warning and embezzlement of public goods by a public servant", and the other on the grounds of "complicity in embezzlement of public funds".
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "haughtiness and embezzlement of social assets".
Among the people who were confronted with Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of public fraud that affected Corsica.
The investigators suspect his society of having contributed to laundering money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste management sector, will be carried out in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
From close sources of investigation, it appears that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which covers waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediary role for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spionage", held the French public in breath, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive eyes of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents preserved by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some of the reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advices on how to deal with their own crisis of "minority" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not allow the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian who was imprisoned in France and wanted by the American judiciary because of trade in material in favor of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Presidium tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible to them the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss into a bright light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French Commentaries on the Way to Deal with Hostilities".
François Richier, Elysée's policy adviser, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, spoke with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do their utmost to bring back their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without ceasing" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocentness", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do this."
Because "silence solves nothing", passing the discussion attempts over inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common Iranian tactic": "a hostage-taking for political blackmail."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due to come about on August 16th, the day she fled to the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he says that the Elysée is anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will get worse."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
One information was circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic materials to Iran, was released from prison after a judge's decision in Paris.
The American embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program.
Has France accepted a cow trade ?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French woman ?
On the occasion of another meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but had also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidium and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision", he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under the "stricter" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser dials a telephone number, re-opens it, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian Embassy in Paris."
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make statements and media-organised "flight attempts" believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influenced intermediary role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is based on so much "thank you" towards Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy asks.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then looks at the reasons that led the Elysée to fall victim to this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts " aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008 that was "early and undeservedly perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad".
"The Syrian role building up" tries to "show Syria what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Aschenbrödel", which will forbid the youth to play online games after midnight by blocking their access, so government officials indicated.
A bill to encourage online game operators to deny access to these games to young people under 16 years of age after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, described by representatives of religious and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also having to live a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Minister of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturer companies would have one year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, he specified.
The government is also concerned to ask manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games to those young people whose parents are asking for it, the responsible person added.
He would also provide free programmes to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also unchallenged champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
On Thursday, FIFA's Executive Committee will call the 2018 and 2022 World Championships' host countries, a highly political election in which shrugging for influence as well as lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Catar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who belong to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) indicates the degree of economic and political commitment of a world championship.
The machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to hold the World Cup once, namely 1966.
On Monday, the BBC had given it a breeding ground again by broadcasting a documentary that attacked three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who, first and foremost, had been lobbying intensively with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the move that his predecessor, Tony Blair, had made in 2005 for London to organize the 2012 Olympic Games.
Would this intensive effort be enough to enhance England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become a weighty outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the unfailing insinuation of the British press's accusations of "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the members of the committee.
"You throw dirt at them, you try to compromise them," Putin bet.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favourites.
First world economic power, headquarters of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s hotly awaited approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which is making Asian chances of 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn up all the registers with the maintenance of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries represent a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time difference) acquired by European countries, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: public awareness
De Gaulle had really pinched.
Mitterrand had made him think he was stumping.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obvious side of the mystery attached to the presidency's function is not well-known.
So you have to pretend that the doubt persists.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac stated that a third mandate was not excluded without believing it.
On November 15, Nicolas assured Sarkozy that he would make his decision "someday in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians would make the perspective of "two mandates" sound, therefore, had spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms of office to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"At worst, you still have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I won't think about the phase after."
His words from the day before make him no more candidate than the day before; but also no less.
If they produce comments, then for a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS urge earlier than accepted to fight.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, voters of the right would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe that he can win," explains Alain Juppé, who has come to terms with the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the imposition of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to come to a close at the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt, without a doubt, cannot afford to lose the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to cause their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
At a press conference yesterday, French finance minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving Europe's public debt.
She has not dared to say whether she believes that the central bank can do more, for example by stimulating her program of buying government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, the day before in Brussels, at his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, had not been very eloquent about his plans, but rather was content to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market would be "continued to operate" and that at the meeting on Thursday we "will see what the decisions are".
The only certainty is that the ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB doubled its bond purchases last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, it is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among traders, there is no doubt about the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price (see page 29).
The economists no longer expect a remarkable change of course.
If the borrowing operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will continue to arise from the unrestricted reserves of funds in a generous way over a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already looking forward to the fact that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially amend its programme."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions on the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of bonds that stimulates the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the public debt markets in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must take the place of the lack of investors on the market at any price and act in such a way to prevent the hasty enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states," testified an important bond holder yesterday.
Indeed, if interest rates were to rise, governments would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilising their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi Government is covering Italy
After an alarming start to the week for Italy, the situation yesterday eased a little with the decline in basic interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "incalculable" and had heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which however the person immediately denied.
On Tuesday, at any rate, the gap with German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "severely concerned" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated dizzying tax revenues that put the state at risk of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget for the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9%) predicted by governments and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the turmoil over a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are settled, which we have been repeating for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, neither in the short-term nor in the long-term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.), is demanding lower levels of stabilisation than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure from the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow the early elections to be organised as early as the end of March.
So there is a little good time for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it very clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe it was proved on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area".
Although quite relative - yesterday's deduction in the interest rate feet of European state bonds was water on the mills of governments as well as the ECB.
However, the beginning of normalisation has not yet been mentioned.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt record, which is probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility that weighs heavily on the banking systems," says the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "the political time passes much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal discussions between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
This also applies to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan includes the lot of unconventional measures to back up the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling already started his Asia tour in Singapour on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the ground for it.
The first investment paper expenditure by the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative entrusted Reuters with supporting a possible increase in funds mobilised by the IMF's additional direct engagement.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the front line, for their part, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that will be added to the austerity measures but will have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other, at all costs, is to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have set up their own budget corrections and decide on unavoidable structural reforms that will bring them back confidence in the long term.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to speed up the normalisation process of sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billions of euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to seize its own pockets again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, who is in the forefront of the European public debt market, judge that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
This money exists: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has all the opportunities to be closely examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are increasing.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in alert level Orange
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange alert due to the looming risk of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in alert state Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
Snow blankets from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region are expected in the affected departments.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic obstructions and affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in emergency situations, and the use of some TER coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy goods transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "calls on drivers to be extremely careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Roissy Paris airport and 10% of those departing from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
DGAB recommends passengers to contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in southern London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry at Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
It is worth recalling in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital contribution of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to lend on the markets a part of the financial sum to double.
The first extrapolations have finally been made today.
The supplementary budget of 2010, which was adopted this morning by the National Assembly's Financial Commission, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These measures are twofold: the creation of a special tax for development and higher taxation of offices on Ile-de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "to the public-law institution of Société du Grand Paris".
This is stated: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganisation of the existing company taxation system: "to modernise it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to transfer this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that contribute?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
You're a long way from the 4 billion.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital that will be raised by the state and will gradually be made available to the Société du Grand Paris for the project", as explained in the explanatory statement.
With the SGP, this system is not at all offensive.
"From the moment one records revenue (the two taxes, the R.), one can cover the project over three years and then draw only from the 4 billion", it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which 4 billions will be sought for a long time to come, is in danger of creating a rather moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Revengeful hackers and busy spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at an international level, giving a foretaste of the regression-dominated future.
But let's go one by one.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence agency (any nation) is made up exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what has been read for months in any other journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the horrific caricatured profile of Gaddafi has been offering cabaret artists material for their sketches for a long time.
The rule that the secret dossiers may consist only of known news is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library devoted to esothermal publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish any research (nor because he does not know where news about the non-existent could be found), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
So are the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as the one that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a fuss made about the disclosures of these dossiers?
On one side they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have turned into espionage centres, with the exception of some small representational tasks.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that a hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the state department.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "sharpening judges".
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, all power could be bundled together like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Since then, Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one considers what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's avenger - can find out the secrets of power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of Berlusconi or Merkel's character is basically a secret free of secret, as it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to deprive them of any power.
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama have done so.
What will be the consequences of this insult that has been inflicted on such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer place any reserved information online - that would be like a display glued to the corner of the street.
But it is equally obvious that it is in vain with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports secret over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relations be maintained in the future, and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see myself compelled to imagine the government agents, moving in a secret way diligently on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their messages nowhere else than in mere memory, and also hiding the few written information they have received in their shoe sales.
The information would be stored in single copy in locked drawers: basically, Watergate's attempt to espionage had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer these days, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band by band by reeling from the back to the front and opening up all the secrets of montage, while the (numerical) CDs today make it possible to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while by plane, including the transfer, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication technology come back to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France talks about its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the rapidly resolved financing promises (also called "Fast Start" or premature financings) that have been realized by the developing countries.
And already the rough French speeches are revealed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU drew up all the registers to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start financing: detailed progress report from its Member States, press conference, major side events, distribution of brochures.
The Transparency operation is remarkable and highly valued for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track to honour its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional contribution has been made, without being to the detriment of official development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark they consider best.
For example, the European Commission has chosen as a benchmark for those of 2009: international financing will be maintained and, within the framework of the "Fast Start" funding, will add 150 million over three years.
Other countries have adopted similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at official development aid level.
In return, France felt that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France pretends to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about that yet, and everyone chooses their computing mode.
Some, such as France, have 1 borrowed € as equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission reduction, based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that is collected as the equivalent of a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be counted as an exposure (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91,5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8,5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) fulfil their obligations 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends € 1 to fulfil its obligations, France will give just 10 cents and understands a comparable commitment.
Nice hocus pocus!
All in all, France's fast-start financing has a double swindle: one part with a further development of the action over time and the other part with the reality of the financial commitment.
France succeeds in making it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (why are the other member states continuing with the donation, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries do not let completely deceive...
The chapter of premature financing only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions about the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (an other, decisive and currently discussed issue): one cannot escape the question of "predictability" or the way in which its loans are booked.
France could change its position in order to be just as progressive in terms of issues as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "predictability" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international basis of trust, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes 81 different chemical substances over the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and respect of coming generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of samples analysed, do not represent a statistically significant value, but represent an illustration of the problem being dealt with", had bought between July and September the food usually consumed within four, from a child about ten years old at meals, plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined as well as snacking by laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is crushing: 81 chemical substances, including 42 potentially or likely to be carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrinine disruptive factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually administered substance are not exceeded in the approximate totality of the cases, this survey is very well understood that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrinine disruptive factors is worrying," notes the association.
Already at breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of insecticide strictly banned in the EU.
In addition, the steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and the chewing gum were peppered with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the case of tap water, the analyses have brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform to light.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues determined, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer is "probably undervalued", the study says.
For its part, the Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in diseases of civilisation".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the presence of residues identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
