Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapid rise in food prices.
Inflation was higher than expected in November in the 13 euro-zone countries - an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded after the 2.6 per cent recorded in October, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
According to Bloomberg, official forecasts were only 3 percent.
In contrast to the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the Leitzsins. In its opinion, the reduction in interest rates would favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment in the wake of an inflation spiral.
The ECB strives to keep inflation below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in a dilemma: inflation has to be "agreed" in order to avoid any need for action later on.
At 3.3 percent, inflation in Germany reached a twelve-year record high in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the eurozone was driven by the rise in food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and soybean prices also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in prices for edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent in 2008, but is expected to decline to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to lower interest rates twice.
Gallup sets up government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably until the beginning of December. First since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while the support for the Socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
Among party-faithful voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to one fifth (20 percent) approval of the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry threshold: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters in both camps has grown by one percent.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic sentiment has deteriorated further - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "very bad" been so high (41 percent), while a further 46 percent consider it to be "quite bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate further; only one tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup survey conducted in December showed that 71% of respondents - a historic high - rated the Prime Minister's work as "rather bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great trust or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be controlled even without a change of government.
After last October's riots, 35% of the people who voted for the government and the head of government remained in office, this figure now stands at only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would "participate with certainty" and another 20% would "probably" cast their vote.
By way of comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would go "with certainty" to the polls, another 15% would consider their participation to be "probable". In view of these trends, the outcome of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fees, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
Imposed on the group of those who took part in the referendum "with certainty" the shares of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, and 89 per cent respectively.
Also most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area have continued this year to maintain the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" rose again this year by 16 percent, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF were recorded in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets last December were "gallopped off", the inflation rate did not fall drastically, compared to the already high, earlier level.
However, it certainly deters consumers that what they paid well under 9,000 HUF for last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets investigated.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, while the prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but for Auchan there were 1kg of breadwax for 139 Forints.
There was no competitive price fall for the product to below 200 forints.
Also surprising was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, in this year's "Napi" shopping cart comparison, Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations show that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 compared to the Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have increased each by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive one of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive one of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1.206.00 Forint, but the VAT increase was noticeable in the prices at last Christmas.
It was precisely this process that hit the trade badly: apparently the department stores were not able to decide which price range to apply to the individual articles, as the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was incalculable.
(If the trader fails to plan the speed of circulation of a product, it can fall by substantial gains in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price of the "Napi" cart in the past year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost around 1,630,00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, with the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office found a price increase of more than 30 % over a period of 12 months.
So in about beside flour also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has risen by hardly more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to pass the drastic price increase on to the multinationals.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; good years are constantly reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, durable foods go in pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning in the morning there were endless queues in all three department stores at the cash desk, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multinationals complain to opinion researchers that they cannot even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places disinfectants are saved
This year, more than a thousand infections were recorded in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overburdening of staff - all factors that are not conducive to the containment of infections, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
The traumatology department of János Hospital recently diagnosed a MRSA infection.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation could not be performed since then because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient’s body.
Until 10 December of this year, infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens from hospitals were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their noses without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the drugs are dosed too much or used improperly, the well-responsive bacteria result in antibiotic-resistant bacteria that spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday sick house life.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there are only where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nurses wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients are examined for MRSA when they are admitted to hospital, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for the control of the formation or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the patients who have been admitted and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, sampling of microbiological samples is not so common.
Not least because there are no subsidies on the part of the state health insurance fund for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore only come to light if the patient already had a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology centre.
On the part of the European Union, there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological investigations are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug from developing, but this directive is not always adhered to by hospitals.
According to Karolina Böröcz, microbiological sampling is even rarer among outpatients or patients in primary care.
Saved for disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transferred from one patient to the other by nursing staff.
It is precisely for this reason that hand washing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted through droplet infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient in the domestic hospitals.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are narrowly lined up, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the less well-placed hospitals it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that almost favour the emergence of infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, such infections are far less common there, or can be prevented from spreading the pathogen where these protective measures are observed.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting a grip on MRSA infections causes enormous costs to health insurance companies, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has identified the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Deathman's Policeman wasn't drunk
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official report is now available.
The meanwhile resigned police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday, after the official report on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he took the wheel.
The former police chief took his own car in the XXII. district to Kossuth Lajos Street and ran over a 55-year-old man who crossed the street at an unmarked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, rank .)
The pedestrian died after he was admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then withdrew its functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has initiated its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
A further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday, with a total value of EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund.The EUR 100 million loan agreement has already been signed earlier, the current agreement is about the use of the EUR 200 million loaned.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose to Hungary and the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later on in the context of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be used in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also discussed.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the metro financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR-linked, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, without any commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe looks attentive to the Balkan state, which was rarely mentioned earlier.
What, where, and who still buys the cheapest market in the EU, but which is rapidly getting more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most sought-after place to buy real estate in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the Renner, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russe has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - trade and office space offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfers' paradises, and thus to attract tourists in addition to the summer and winter season also in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying in on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while the Black Sea and ski resorts are predominantly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle buy either revitalized properties for 500,100,000 euros, or run-down houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are important, but the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are also crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was ranked among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of businessmen who invest in order to increase medium to long-term value.
Real estate in the capital, however, is becoming more and more expensive, due to the ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are lowest in Bulgaria, but there has been an annual increase of 21 percent over the past five years.
The price increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
There is currently a fierce debate between developed and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether developed countries are prepared to support developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on support for developing countries.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, probably at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be seen in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's six percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (in line with 1990 levels), regardless of whether the "Agreement after 2012" was successful or not. In fact, the Union would be prepared to commit itself to a 30% reduction if other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries, were also willing to fulfil their commitments as efficiently and responsibly as possible.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the goal of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its 15 member states at the time, had already committed itself to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will certainly meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The deployment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction plans laid down in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by a renewed international emission reduction system, the importance of which has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee of the UN, which has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in its recent report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and increase the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, leading to extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British army advertises on YouTube
British Army units have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube: Special Forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos about operations against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The images shot with miniature cameras attached to helmets are controlled at the air base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message unavoidable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under defenceheadquarters in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraq-based International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Luftwaffe published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population of the actual objectives of foreign operations.
According to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie of the BBC, propaganda published in this way is almost free of charge, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
American advertising with game
But the army must also fight against amateur shots, which, in addition to carefully processed, censored recordings, also make it into the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are at most discussed, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, by the way, numerous videos filmed in action have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "genuine" for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "Americas Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-scattered simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means squeamish: instead of a Christmas party, she organises a working conference at which her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsch.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, while others conjure up Christmas atmosphere with raffles or kicks into the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already affected the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held in the Defense Department this year, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Celebration of the Orphans" children are given gifts from fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Celebration" family members are entertained by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFC) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport beat over the strands.
The 4,32 million Forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of Tomorrow, with some 350 of the 600 employees expected.
The main focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFCA) held its 4.7 million-forint Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The room rental amounted to 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, one department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt did not confirm this information because we did not reach the responsible parties.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was stated that there was no obligation to wear a ball gown or a suit on the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government are each preparing for puritanic celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 Forints.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party but to the conference at the end of the year.
It is expected that about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only served with coffee and pogatsch, the celebration is about 350,000 forints.
Self-Government Minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the hall of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas party in its own festival hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured with 2,500 forints per capita - around this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent push.
Since the beginning of János Veres' term of office, PM employees have been celebrating in this way every year.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year's reception on January 20th, and the Ministry's Christmas party is cancelled this time.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"; according to the department, the expenses are 1,000 forints per guest.
As the Press Department reports, it will be a very simple stand-up reception to which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a brief speech by the Minister and end with restrained feasting.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the costs of the Christmas party, no information could be provided by the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant-strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordinating committee on Friday for an indefinite strike beginning on Monday.
On Saturday a protest general assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the stoppage of work will begin.
Strike-related, significant traffic obstructions are expected, as rail transport is almost completely stopped, and Budapest's public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest general assembly will be held, and from Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will cease work indefinitely unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike, which began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act, was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
If the law is passed, however, the strike committees meet to discuss the future course of action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will only take place in the late evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes, which begin on Monday, will have to count on significant traffic obstructions: the railway workers lay down their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies stand still.
At the same time, there will be motorway closures in many places in one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, while others are planning a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers VDSZSZ on sufficient performance, although more and more people are travelling by train just around Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV is on strike from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy put down work for four hours, and the teachers' union bwz. the Democratic Teachers' Union have called for 2- and 2-8 hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on an alternating strike at various times throughout the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SCEF, the forum for trade union cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and presents a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three states that the eligible occupational groups will be given access to the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ belonging to the League of Trade Unions did not accept the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the secondary lines and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
Among other things, the Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states that in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "enhancement of existing ethnic tensions between Gypsies and non-Gypsies in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such an argument, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposition".
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, thanks not least to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "have seriously damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember that since autumn 2006 the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been on the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several organizations called "National Self-Defense Association" have been founded.
"These groups are in common that they each define themselves as a civil organization, while openly brag about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (catastrophe protection, national defence, protection of order), citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: All this should be done according to the method that seeks to disguise various political aspirations as bourgeois initiatives, based on the political and party displeasure of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association thus serve not only to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration at the court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was founded in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard stood the Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as an occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organization is "national protection".
In their opinion, a veritable "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria has been noticeable in the past 17 years, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent - so political capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have launched a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they will set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the Risk Warning Report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually and, if risk-changing trends are identified, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the release of the risk warning report.
Festivals are not everywhere Holidays
In Hungary, public holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of redistributing the working days around the public holidays has become established, but the coming year will bring us fewer such days.
In the EU and in America, too, there is something else called "Holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and days off work.
Days off work are usually church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we are also celebrating New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are working days - the latter alone so that the New Year's Eve celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are March 15, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and October 23, the memorial day of the revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August the foundation of the state is celebrated, on the 1st of May the work is celebrated, on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "shifting work days" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finally processed, has been defined for many years by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants alike.
Only companies and institutions in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on public holidays, are excluded.
This year, only the holidays at the end of the year confuse the working order somewhat: from 24 December on, life in this country stops formally, since most people take time balances for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the holiday reserved for this purpose.
Next year, there will be more holidays in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day so that Friday 2 May can be a day of rest.
The second redisposition is related to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, Friday, October 24th will have to be worked out in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be completely marked by the holidays, after everything has been lying and standing since 24 December, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to annoy workmates
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" into everyday life at the workplace.
The question is simply whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or if you better face the challenge and try to consciously avoid them for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says a colleague.
That it missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by perhaps calling the marketing department and remorsefully confessing that you forgot to post the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's all over with an apology.
Before getting involved in embarrassing excuses, consider what really makes your colleagues uncomfortable and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's hardly anything more annoying than grabbing a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking questions, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has gone away.
Well, don't put envelopes or post-it from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you: no more there when you really need it.
Talking about colleagues' private lives?
There is no effective way to stop a gossip that has already been born.
Who did what with whom?
Where and why?
One should not tie the information (or assumptions) about the private life of the colleagues to the nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and reveals his innermost secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to keep silent like a grave, rather than directing those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call in the office to report ill with reference to painful headaches, because you feel uncomfortable right now, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, unstoppable executions, projects with fixed appointments now have to be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play bad with the colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not be able to get into the office the next day, or that something could come in between, so that you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
humming, giggles, phone calls
You're in the middle of your work, but you suddenly get disturbed by the loud giggles of your colleagues?
Is there an unwanted phone call you shouldn't have heard?
One should not annoy colleagues with hums, singing, loud conversations (which one leads over their heads), jumbles, constant scolding or nagging.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not exactly in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed on time, one has forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, one should not look for the guilt of one's own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the noisy colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake or make up for the missed is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and slaps: Comfortable for home, but has nothing in the office!
Not even then should one dress so casually, if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
To make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not spoiled us for a long time with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the traffic differently when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, as many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene, slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock is "in" again with its guitar scramble, the local electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, playing music himself in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because an inn can't handle two pipers - started his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, was only achieved when one had approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, became the almost only trendsetter, also marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they liked to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The term comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but apart from the ethereal character of the music, the pure guitar, the influences of rock'n'roll, according to the zeitgeist and the trends, are noticeable.
With these songs, singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", introduced himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - the recent pop music broadcaster Mr2 Petőfi has gradually caught the listener's attention with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "shift music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but they can also only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The listener's willingness to record also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially to the west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more attentively because they also consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
We do not create music to serve a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but these in turn exist only in the incomprehensible changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that if you want to please everyone, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built up his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, not to mention trying to interpret this into our music time and time again.
We see ourselves as more of a team player who trusts in the musical presence of the other and lets them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a somewhat more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then be considered a draw horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir of talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same way, or did the girls do it?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for some time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came in handy right away and frighteningly spontaneous.
I can remember, I was quite electrified at the time, but the "Divas" was already in need.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also standing on the back of the stage.
Is it on purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were in the back was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
In the number it is also a matter of forgetting one's ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where we are going, we simply allow these particular wings, the wings of love, to lift us up.
I would like others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: With the musical work actually none, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work any longer, but gradually everything got together, like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and now that I have left the album "losen".
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent brokers risked billions because of inferiority
Soilless fraudsters
This is what his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka, describes.
It came for him by almost five billion euros.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do it immediately to his colleagues, and was certainly not incapable of doing so.
Unlike all major bank houses, he recognized the crisis on the American mortgage market in time.
"He is rather mentally weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
But as Kerviel’s statements, published by the French media, such as the daily Le Monde, show, he was a person who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros in his business at the end of last year.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He had already guessed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February there were already first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and was right.
At the end of the year, he had increased his profit to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits and goes on to say that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During all the interrogation, he admits that he forged documents so he wouldn't get caught.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even though the Eurex stock exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to blow up?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position step by step.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90000.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"I already knew that I was being watched during my first conversation in 2005.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of Allianz, he made a lot of money by placing half a billion euros on price losses in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew about everything, or suspected it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get to him?
Suspected, he went on vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look him in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kroner) in the coming years.
It is about half of the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kroner come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Business and Innovation" programme.
The most money, about 150 billion, will go into transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies attract funds to innovative enterprises.
The aim is to provide companies with finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
Among the new candidate countries, the Czech Republic is one of the least successful in the current EU fund acquisition.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20 years in prison for ex-president
On Thursday, a court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (nearly $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the AP, it is currently unclear whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is back behind bars.
According to Ileana Pérez, chairman of the Court of Appeals, it will now depend on the prison officials to have Alemán serve his sentence at home, or whether he has to go to prison.
A court four years ago proved that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts really belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to fund his 2001 campaign.
The budget is financed by:
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What's special about this household?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The one for the current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because it was presented by Minister Sobotka (from this party), and the ČSSD could not therefore allow itself to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Deputies approved this law, which has traditionally been little respected, but which is still extremely important, calmly.
It's kind of paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is obscured by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past social democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot resolve at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure required by law, not only in terms of pensions, but also in terms of social expenditure decided by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) last year before the elections.
The second is deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third constraint is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and reasonably under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in order to tap into other sources of investment other than income from taxes, taxes, and bank loans, often issued unconsidered debt securities that over-indebted their councillors.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through the massive sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks that they had received from the state in the wake of privatisation.
Now this source has already dried up.
As far as we stick only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
our economy, like the rest of the world, has been undergoing a period of growth for several years, the ČSSD boasting without ceasing.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge disgrace, mainly due to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why no massive social programmes are needed, which, unfortunately, have been inflated to a gigantic extent in the last few years.
Although it has been possible to delete some of the senseless populist spending that was adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if the retirement age does not shift and pension reform does not occur in the near future, then virtually every policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, it will remain nothing but pure administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social spending.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the suppression of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner planned for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent over the last ten years, which was the only option.
If we do not want it to really happen that ruling politicians become mere administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to collect taxes and fees to want rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow for a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks Want to Cope With Crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
For example, more than $100 billion will go to the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the US Fed is sending $40 billion at auction, and another $24 is making it loose for the European and Swiss central banks.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to ward off or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in a report for his clients.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unserved loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions to be lost.
""The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still be done when they decided to do so," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have hard access to bonds, loans will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly with an impact on global economic growth.
The central banks have decided, after they failed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used for lending money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Reuters agency.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks is contributing to heating up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists’ debates are implausible
Global climate change is said to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet", he stated that the debates of ecologists were implausible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word-firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often encounter caricatures of my views."
So now interested ones could read his attitude undistorted.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he was an academic, capable of understanding and judging technical papers, had experience with statistics and was also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore are not a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, which he regards as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not opposed to "a reasonable environmental protection, but to militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already spoken about the same topic at the Hayek Institute in Vienna two months ago.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can get a new licence issued by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will go to the streets without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not changed their licence.
While small towns report a strong drop in interest in the exchange of refugees, the offices of the capital are being overcrowded with applications, and interest in exchange grew this week.
The city administration handles around 2000 customers every day.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague about 140000 drivers have not changed their driver's license yet.
The issue of a new driver's license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must add 500 kroner.
Motorists who fail to make the required exchange by the end of the year and drive without a valid driver's license are facing a fine from January onwards.
The evildoer pays a maximum of 2000 kroner.
However, the police can also put an end to the transgression with a warning.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may rise to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, even the one who does not drive can get a penalty imposed by the municipality.
It was said that he could face a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the offices to exercise mildness and impose a maximum penalty of 1000 kroner.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatened a thousand crowns.
The driving licence was a document in which everyone could decide whether or not to own it.
It was not an identity card that everyone, and indeed a valid one, had to have.
People who don't want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It is enough to take him to the competent municipal office or send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will become invalid.
However, drivers will gradually have to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers fines for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, accused of having joined forces with David Berdych's gang, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
This was decided by the Prague Higher Regional Court in a final judgment, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision in the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this case, but he is faced with the judgment of the first instance.
In other trials, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He can't be sentenced to more.
In January, a district court found 19 persons guilty mainly of involvement in robberies, and today the Oberlandesgericht tried the appeal of 16 of them.
From the outset, most accused objected to the prosecution on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with, among others, Berdych, handed over information from police sources, covered various robberies, and helped members of the gang escape prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the loot.
The prosecution deals with crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robbery, the victims of which have often suffered serious injuries, but also imprisonment and illicit possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser rifle and a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has been enriched by many millions of crowns by their robberies.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, courts recognized Berdych and a number of others as guilty of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and wait for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have so far missed the main hearing.
Children swapped - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million kroner compensation from the hospital in Třebÿ plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parents.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore completely disagrees with the proposal made by Velebas.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," said Dostál after today's trial.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the expert opinion, which had the opposite side drawn up.
We'll see if it's even worth a statement.
However, we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 kroner for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million kroner for every month that their biological daughter had not raised.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert report drawn up for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in varying degrees of intensity and depth.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even if they were faced with accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, get along worse with the aftereffects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is currently going on, Veleba summed up the content.
On 9 December last year, Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity clinic in Třeb.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district captain of the Vysočina (Bohemian-Mährische Höhe) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by the hospital in Třeb
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally liable.
In case of doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund and only exceptionally can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low compensation amounts to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and ranged in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came to his kingdom Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the fight over the "Kingdom of Wallachia" brand.
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor.
Polívka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, this is probably not over and his client is likely to appeal.
"The issue is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in Bolek Polívka's popularity parasiticly," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
Everyone introduced himself to this actor and comedian in the words "Walachisches Königreich".
The same is true of Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money raising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is a dispute over money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasiticly in our work," he continued.
Lucative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that was not related to the intention to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš thought of spending Walachian passports.
From an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity emerged, to which Harabiš then joined the founding of the company "Valachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívka has certainly helped the project of the Wallachian kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had devoted themselves intensively to him.
The cooperation of the parties that are now divided lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected to the day of St. Nimmerlein".
At the suggestion of Harabiš Jarmila Šuláková, she took the lead as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
The competition for the throne and half a princess prepared by Harabiš could bring clarity in the dispute.
From this a new king was to emerge.
He didn't want to reveal details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be something like the king's parade in Walachia.
The king was to be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also register quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages dwindling
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear shift, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The station wagon with the designation SW is still a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of headroom in the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-metre men will suffer.
Quick on
I only go through the interior for a short time so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I have objections only because of the meager middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may have complained about too short seats or head restraints.
The sidehold has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
The combination also eliminates the already mentioned lack of headroom.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the hold.
I have to call it (also because of the hinged rear window) very easy to load and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with straps, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the Czech best-selling vehicle of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is left by a clearly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when you invite a stroller.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading space after the rear seats have been folded or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that's what a 1600-cubic engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him to his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes looks like his exhaust is clogged with a rag, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we have to remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 kroner is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test car beats again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper release, electric window lifters at the back and...
So the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but count the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar amount.
So all that remains is the choice of which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, causing fears among locals about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where conflicts between the locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Arguments, harassment, and brawls among students have shifted to relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself by the fact that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene against a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two underage girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed up a bushhouse and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students from The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even called the conflict with immigrants from Eastern Europe a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In Great Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here looking for a job.
Some 30000 Slovak pupils therefore attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will come true if you just choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palm trees and All Inclusive with waiters who offer pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the very end of the 20th century.
One of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, had it built, because everything that was considered a crime in the US (especially during prohibition) was gladly seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
==References====External links==
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rises grew, and across the broad boulevards were cars that were one of the iconic symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana to this day, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Havana, especially its oldest part, may have run down sharply, nowhere in the vicinity can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as just here.
Other places are being cleaned up, such as Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a mottle that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow-gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cute and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
Most of Cuba's visitors do not miss the most important places.
So you no longer have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
The only thing to mention is that there is a museum in the already mentioned Hemingways estate, the visit of which should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on calcareous soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities fertile soil was accumulated, through which also weathered rocky areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was shot there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The trade in slaves and sugar brought fame and wealth to her.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road connecting the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation helped to keep it unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but nothing was torn down, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon to spend with Trinidad, it is worth visiting interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Valley of Sugar Mills".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after the darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
Some call this town in the east of Cuba the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way to it.
Both roads, which lead from Guantánamo to this point, have to overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its World Heritage List thanks to its untouched nature.
The best chocolate is produced there, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, about all this one could write many pages.
Yes, as they say: better to look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not follow their ideas, and in Edinburgh, Scotland, the representatives of the countries that stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO units to do more, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"A forward development is noticeable in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start developing their own economy and security," says British Defense Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and by sixty percent in the southern province of Helmand.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
More specifically, they call for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them," Gates said.
The Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, said the same thing today.
"I am not pleased with what we have in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," De Hoop told Reuters Agency at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute over whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best in recent months.
For example, Germany was criticized for passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan non-stuers unmasked: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bildzeitung went over to the counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Public debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84000 kroner.
The total debt increased to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kunas this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy.
The Czech Republic's public debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they thus increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the public debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84000 kroner.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion kroner.
"So far, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year's debt was to be between 900 billion and a trillion kroner," said David Marek, analyst at Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, said: "We could come to exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I do not expect such a change," he remarked.
Debt growth
The government debt stems from the debt of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
This year's domestic public debt rose to 719.4 billion kroner.
Foreign debt of the state increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called marketable public debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"Over the year, the total debt increased by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter, which is really much, given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that the increase is mainly in the debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," said Pikora, commenting on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion kroner this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion kroner instead of the estimated 91.3 billion kroner.
It is also a maximum budget for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten-billion-euro reserve to pay pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and instalments for bonds with the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged with insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison and subsequently expelled by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British woman was accused of having allowed six to seven-year-old students to give the name Mahomet to a teddy bear, even though any portrayal of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserved to be flogged.
After parents of students complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School in Khartoum, was picked up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-old student to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed , reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear himself did not wear a shield with that name, but the problem is quite simply that the portrayal of the Islamic Prophet is regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knows them well and that she never did anything to get too close to a religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion it is only an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by numerous students of the teacher who describe it as being very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Consider that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common second name in Britain, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is regarded as a kind of homage to the Prophet (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last meeting of the negotiations in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo closed a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, Wednesday morning, without overcoming their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, said the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner, called on Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of placements on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks held by Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and final negotiating meeting since the Troika had been given a mandate by the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains the advocate of a negotiated solution, a mutually agreed solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After having been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to proclaim this unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, announced Fatmir Sejdiu, president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations of the last chance have been conducted since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
He added, however, that the plan for autonomy proposed by Belgrade belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.
Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it particularly favors a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely and solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally holds a veto.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end up as they began: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied to the journalists that Kosovo's parliament would have the last word on status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking people would be conducted in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush eludes an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference, which had gathered in Annapolis, Maryland, under his leadership on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally reached a joint declaration.
He also stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the Roadmap for Peace, which they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty to resolve all outstanding issues without exception, and including central issues.
This term covers the three major problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians are mainly concerned with: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homes in the present state of Israel in the wake of the 1948 conflict.
After the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and that all issues be regulated, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he undertook that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to put an end to them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which exist side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received a commitment from Bush in this sense before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, says the Saudi Arabian prince in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arab-language daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the National Disciplinary Bureau of Police (IGPN), a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m.
He had no use, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a spokesman of the police.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without registration, thus not approved for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two teenagers without helmet, at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its way from the right, a policeman explained further.
The alcohol control carried out at the vehicle passengers is much negative.
The condition of the car (buried fender, broken windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary personal murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main public security department of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that at this stage, the investigation of the IGPN excluded the responsibility of the police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday a sort of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained tangled together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were intercepted yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the rounds that the police would have left the accident site very quickly, without helping the two young people.
Although the ICPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious error in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires further investigation, and which requires very careful action.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman limping.
Two more tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth on the phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly developed around the event and, it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces did not help the young people.
These young people have been given first aid.
The fire department came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her, stressed the prosecutor.
In Pakistan the tension is rising
On Monday, the Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared the state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades used by the police there.
Those then threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested temporarily.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them would have been arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court's Bar have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of approximately 500 arrests of opposition, human rights advocates and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northeast).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president called on the population to send flowers to the judges who had spoken out against the emergency, and to those who had taken an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf’s promise is no longer valid
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a stand on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on 6 October.
The chairman of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give up command of the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the invocation of the state of emergency, declared the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
It was expected that he would hand over his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned these days.
For one out of five couples, even calculated on the month accurately, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit, which, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to carry out the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a large cylindrical part that will soon take up European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to power them.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-ton module for electricity generation via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew embarked on the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, whose wingspan is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can be folded up like accordions was damaged by a jammed cable on a length of about a meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a control gear and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around the end of the 30-metre long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle attached to the station to carry out repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skilled, he has a well developed torso and long arms.
So the 46-year-old trained doctor was chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After he had carefully examined the damage, he severed the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rails on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey bat, wrapped with an insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, the astronauts had devised and tinkered on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely folded up before he counted off his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery today to take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Aviation and Defence Group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counter the A400M's backlog, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to re-examine its 2007 business forecasts with reference to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delay the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month lag.
As a reminder, the EADS' business performance fell from 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, that of the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had scheduled for the first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday it won't be exciting to count the ballot boxes: the mass of Russians will choose President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, it confirms its pursuit of stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to voters on the public channels, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He is doing this in his capacity as the leading candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kreml party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, when the President received the foreign ambassadors, the President did not let anything go through and was satisfied with a new attack on the Western powers accused of interference-- his favourite subject during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the opposition's point of view, they were wrong.
It denounces an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there have never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin .
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-chasing world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrators, according to his lawyer continues to ban visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two far-reaching questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The term of office yesterday announced the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand up for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party United Russia, who will elect government and president?
Whatever it is, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the power to date will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus, they are not the master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes even further back: bourgeois society in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe, has only developed very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has re-established the model of a paternalist state, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more so as this new paternalism was not followed by terror but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility they have shown for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
What's the point of thinking for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional leaders) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why think long?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why replace them?
A Hard Memento
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents in the archive, which are located in Bad Arolsen for a total length of 27 km, could not be viewed until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the eleven states responsible for their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the USA, agreed to make it available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Cheerful information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced labourers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
After the war, the prisoner lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen still handle tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
In 2006, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, explained that nothing fundamentally new can be expected in these documents.
The EU and India want to achieve a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India are hoping to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will push the two economic areas forward enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner added. Asian and European giants exchange goods worth 47 billion euros and services worth 10 billion euros each year, Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, said this week, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. EU and India will meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about the current recurring concern over credit conditions and announced an offer of £10 billion with a base interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty as to the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open-market operation for five weeks, it states in a communication.
The Bank further states that this will bring 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) into circulation on 6 December at 12.15 GMT, at the property tax rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to maintain the daily differences in the interest rates of the inter-Bänkish loans at their base rate.
The rate of interest on Wednesday was 5.829%, which varies from day to day.
The three-month interest rate has fallen to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with fines that the banks had prevented from using.
According to some rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS' proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, the majority of which were on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIP, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some violent exchanges between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television show on purchasing power.
The leader of PS MP Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the financial correction bill that had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he's ever attended, says his company and Melvin Benn's are working side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We had negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in 2005 at Grand Park Chicago, after taking a leading role in the world of the festival together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events were able to generate $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax revenue in 2007.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours are more likely to take place on urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is, in one way or another, to merge these two concepts in order to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival in the European way and of an urban one in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, is taking the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to include a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the festival's recording capacity is "very large", roughly equivalent to the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It's not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no one stands up to it less than the Terminator.
These lure attempts are among the delegate tasks.
A politically "heavy mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
"You have to be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of the cinema there is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the West Coast Festivals, although Sundance, Denver, Seattle, or San Francisco, will be about presenting the Quebec films, evaluating them, and making sure the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing a end-year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the annual financial statements on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing hands with regard to the upcoming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot provide reliable forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that from a purely statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market is usually associated with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially when serious tensions determine the current market situation.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and market participants, who, due to the lack of secure equity funds, invest mainly in pension funds, which are severely affected by the upward trend towards profitable assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock market will tend to show a more lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible fall in the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate, an uncertainty mainly due to the rise in crude oil prices and the risk of inflation rising.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the Sales Department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4 % since its highest mark on 8 November of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional subsidy of the pension fund, which was made around this time each year.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that things could develop a little differently this year, mainly due to the end-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and thus directly after the day of the bridge to the day of the constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the market situation assessments to date are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values that depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of the values to drive the Ibex to new heights.
Solana von Intermoney affirms that it is the turn of the great values this year.
One of the value winners would be the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from Bank Inversis assures that the increases in connection with the banking and industrial sectors will be accompanied.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, says the expert.
With regard to the increased consumption behaviour during the Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine market activity in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only present in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has seen only two falls in prices.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally to date.
This year, when the Ibex 35 picked up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a 6.68% rise in exchange rates.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex increases by 8.36% since January) and can also show a final year rally will show.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in Spain's strongest economic regions.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, as Popular is the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches weekdays to 20.30h and start Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which also repeatedly reported the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The Bank's ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at reaching an agreement where 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open on one day of the week in the afternoon, albeit not for the customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening times, will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their location, can capture the shopping clientele of independent, small and medium-sized companies as well as those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as they are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will reorganise the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
In this way, the expansion of the opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, more colourful design.
The relevant bank representative, Ángel Rivera, assures that the restructuring would not require major investments, but would involve an increase in staff recruitment, as a branch no longer required six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approximately 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these stores of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We don't want to compete with our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally reached an agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private channel Telecinco doubles its market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the close of the stock exchange. The station led by him had increased its value by two times its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that's exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they did not sink too low.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, goodwill now reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%) and Vocento holding only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to 2,193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other publicly listed communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable, it rises to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that they are two similar companies, says Vasile.
The question still seems uncertain, to what extent we can actually act in exchange technology, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first television station this year with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues, as assured by Guiseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The analysts see the main factor for Telecinco's comparative better stock market performance in the high payout ratio that the company has been able to show up to the present time: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría initiated a 100% dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares in Endemol, with Mediaset as its parent company, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged by the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more so far.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already increased by purchasing 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
Three options.
1.
Ibersecuritys: relies on its high effective yield and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buying) is more advantageous than Antena 3 because of the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends resetting expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
Congress agrees with the MIFID directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which ended its session today with the Congressional decision in the Senate on the additional/amendments related to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congressmen and Senatemen, who in their negotiations and votes had the aim of establishing the best possible regulation, which guarantees the security of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities, in order to guarantee a generally efficient market activity.
In addition to modernising financial markets, the MIFID, which re-defines the ISD, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the rights of control of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows financial advice to be provided to both specialised firms and to natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consultancy companies that associate with the investment and brokerage companies of securities.
It also extends the number of systems for carrying out financial transactions so that the regulated revolving markets are added to the multilateral systems of securities trading and the systems for internationalising trading orders, which would eventually compete with current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to make known the priorities of their business profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out, in order to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
In retrospect, the Congressional Economic Commission made further changes, with the decision that due to its high level of risk, the bond must now be regarded as complex financing for the investor, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the areas of work of qualified economists was used; 30 years after the 1977 Regulation, which restricted the areas of work reserved for economists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the financial mediator, who works on behalf of others, does not need authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services to commercialize products and to acquire customers at the same time several investment companies.
The harmonised index of consumer prices (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation rates within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in accordance with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare local and quality data with US products by means of the publication of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be made early by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator that had been identified prematurely would only serve as a benchmark, and therefore would not be in line with the final result announced next 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development and at the same time he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless , Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current figure is not good , the inflation differential between Spain and the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years .
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister of Economy and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half after the Bank had asked the British central bank for emergency loans in mid-September last year due to a crisis, and they now amount to only £12,000 million (equivalent to €16,800 million).
At that time, the Bank’s assets amounted to record £25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably within two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence, and will continue to decline until the end of the crisis, despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money was safe.
The Virgin company, which would continue to operate the group after the acquisition under the Virgin Money brand, will have to contribute about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will consist of the assets of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to reach their target of 30 billion.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, well-known for its prominent advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to channel £50,000 (approximately €70 million) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban planning corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular), which belongs to the municipality of Murcia, because of the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales last May, currently a member of the Popular Party and then chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, and could be the original mastermind of the plot, according to the broadcaster Cadena SER.
Officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and therefore privileged deputy Juan Morales was arrested when leaving the residence of his client on the basis of important incriminating documents that are supposed to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on the alleged order payments by Morales to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban planning contract in which the development of a 200 hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory of the Socialists, will take over the office of Congress President.
José Blanco, PSOE's organizational secretary, and Bono announced it at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero at the party's headquarters today.
In the view of the Head of Government, the offer to the former Minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the coming elections, the Mancha politician would appear to be running for the party's chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of the Congress, who had announced last 15 November that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, end his career in public politics and instead work for climate protection in the university sector.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had continuously urged his return to political activity.
He also pointed out that, as in the case of the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to deprive the citizens of who would take over the position of President of Congress in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should indeed take office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a house of respect, not of insult or outcry, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time, one gets the impression that the only place where one cannot speak calmly and calmly in Madrid is the Congress; so the President of the Government was interrupted once up to 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to give the impression that he had already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is relentlessly critical of both the sceptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront in this regard, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts it in need of explanation as to the action or non-action of its government, which has played a decisive role in ensuring that Spain is at the top of the list of countries within the EU that have least complied with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are those responsible for failing to comply with the requirements, which sectors are responsible for this, and why did his government, which had proposed the Treaty with the planet, not stop this development.
In addition, he is now forced to explain to the Spanish citizens the measures he envisages to combat climate change.
Which companies will be affected by it, which behaviour of the citizens should be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and which economic consequences result from it.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for saving the planet.
However, there are and will be no such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and paying.
The measures that can be used against climate change in real terms are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed to Zapatero so dangerous from a strategic point of view that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his treaties with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician does not have to talk, accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue, decorate the meetings and inspire others with his meekness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or that we can only refresh ourselves with one fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to a supposed involvement in an urban-planning corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcia-based town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. Moreover, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel contractor were taken into custody because of the alleged suspicion of urban development violations, according to the investigation.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is until now, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the investigations already carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of unexploited land for urban development projects should be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should build 4000 apartments on the property after the local administration had given it illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but were subject to an investigation initiated and conducted by Totona's first court.
The first six arrested were brought before the judge today.
According to investigation circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales are also investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who resides in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is said to have acted as a sub-group of Nuaria and received the bribe.
The investigation is carried out by the local authority against urban development offences, under the supervision of the Guardia Civil Central Unit, whose representatives carried out eleven further searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally well-known poultry farming industry, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana, which was to be rebuilt. The aim was to realize a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the parking spaces of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things That Can Happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term book of the month and instead try to invent a price-name of another name with appropriate competences.
I already have a suggestion.
Guys, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which comments on the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November; by chance, on that day, the issue of which contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the subject of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school graduate who quoted Plato's and Nietzsche's works in his news.
In an interview with Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, asked the teachers to take a more critical position against Plato and proposed to remove Plato's teaching from the lower-level curricula for philosophy at high schools.

One colleague informed about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which would be concerned with six months of imprisonment.
But if you again rob a music business with a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than with a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and give it back forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than when you download it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in a music data exchange.
Taking part in a rebellious struggle results in a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered to be less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization by the authors has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has raised his demands quite a bit.

My family doctor presents me with one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially if the others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of colleagues.
The study was prepared with the help of a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the Science journal.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn Brain Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to see that the brain activities were always very moderate if both participants were correct with their answer and therefore received the same content; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been inexorably searching for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is located in the prosecutor's office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, as the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - namely the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still at large.
Their names are on the list of Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary films La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in its attempt to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which again depends on various factors, including age, gender, the time when the driver's licence was drawn up, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it must be clear what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which states that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to present the corresponding severance sum in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance which is composed of several factors, including age, sex, time of drawing up the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are also due in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women have to pay less, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, who, according to the statistical values and therefore also to the firm's conviction, tend to have fewer accidents than single persons.
The benefits attributed to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In drawing up the premium, insurance companies must take account of a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best suits his personal needs.
We now list the most important points that should be considered when choosing an insurance policy in order to be able to make not only a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The under-25s encounter numerous obstacles when choosing low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and a young driver's license.
Even if it would be best to take out comprehensive insurance for an ideal insurance cover, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a fully self-sufficient, so that the benefits of a fully comprehensive insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay part of the amount incurred as a result of the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, the main representative of Spain at First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused to his own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hands to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the tariff in question.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it may allow itself to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. This is due to the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
Thus, it makes the most sense to opt for a comprehensive insurance with excess.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish manager of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been abandoned.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out comprehensive insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the corresponding person allows it.
The insurers consider married couples with children to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly their contributions are also low.
In this case, the best option would be a fully comprehensive insurance with a deductible (for an amount of around 300 euros). In the event that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance policy is recommended, which will only start for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to set up a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a comprehensive insurance with a deductible (for an amount of around 150 euros) or an extended insurance, which only applies with a sufficiently high credit.
In the end, it is important to note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it involves high costs, which require a thorough selection to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow is hoping for the point for the eighth final in Milan
Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point they lack next Tuesday in San Siro in order to reach their respective goals before the final of the Champions League preliminary round. Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the latter decides on their participation in the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs another to make sure that Shakhtar FC with six points does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
Group D's two games will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan FC will have to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the semi-final on the 13th, to enter the final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished ahead of everyone else and the draw in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtics Glasgow knows that they would be group first in the event of a victory and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be able to qualify for a defeat in a sloppy game of Shakhtar FC. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because the Ukrainians are entitled to participate in nine points of the match; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but were able to win in the second match (2-0).
So the Milanese will try to ruin the evening for the Scots. Again, they hope to reach the eighth final of the remodeled Champions League for the second time in a row, after being defeated in the previous season by a goal of Kaka in the follow-up time (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the round.
While Shakhtar FC is waiting for the Rossoneri to win, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the eighth-finals and joining UEFA depend on their victory and defeating Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could win third place, despite its lower standings and without the prospect of continuing to compete in the biggest European championship, and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls Tour concert in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators after the band's disbandment in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained just before their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the atmosphere in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to witness the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video about the band's history, which caused a stir at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two other new songs, headlines and voodoo, which is released in Spain under the label EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the crowds who made the GM Palace glow, even though the nerves of his spouse Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Schow, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star has not seen our wardrobe once, and so I am very excited to see what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice , whose departure from the group in 1998 brought about the dissolution of the group two years later due to internal disagreements, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings towards the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm commented on the break-up of the band that caused her nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes were resolved and that everyone was very fond of each other.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane operated by Virgin Airlines, according to a report by CTV.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (on December 4th) and Los Angeles (on December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears about gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia is disappearing, increasing the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe being affected.
Most of Russia's gas exports to the European Union (EU) are channelled through Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia with higher transit charges.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be charged more, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," said Ukraine's Minister of Economic Affairs Anatoli Kinakh of Reuters News Agency.
"The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit charges [to Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drastically pushed prices up.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve controls on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish public health service had no precise idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an SUV was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October, and was charged with the alleged car bomb attack in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to hiring foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although the Health Authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main examiner's report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines on criminal records, which help employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these controls in some personnel records, they were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines to a large extent before hiring, but added, "Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks in the run-up to the recruitment of potential NHS staff.
"The report states that current pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards of directors have problems identifying those employees who are on indefinite leave.
The investigation also found that established control procedures were largely followed by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for controls before starting employment for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was my intention to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on screening prior to the recruitment of all staff, including those from abroad, whose publication is scheduled next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, including for the best film.
The awards were also given to leading actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded the best leading actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for bringing the British film into the world.
The prizes were presented in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was shot for only 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has awarded two prizes to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known so far for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best director's debut.
Rock music was the focus of another prize winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer was awarded the prize for the best documentary film.
The prize for the best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's thriller Easter Promises playing in London.
Ray Winstone, who stands in the reputation of playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Niggy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clergymen and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle in missiles.
sympathizers of Al-Qaeda have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid response force to protect facilities following a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, with reference to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the detainees were planning to kill clergymen and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis striving for Iraq to join forces with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied armed forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabia-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy-sector facilities.
"This was a huge effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told the state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on Venus could show a view of the future of the Earth
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship in orbit show that the planet is even more like an averted twin of the Earth than was previously conscious.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Millions of years ago, on Venus, conditions would have prevailed that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could have even been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotational pace, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which has examined the planet for one year, offer a sobering look at how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physics Department at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data allow us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched Uranium" seized by the police
One kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
All still open
Mitt Romey said he didn't consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally agreed to engage in a debate on YouTube, where ordinary voters record and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican party that is going to start next year's elections.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate, who chose YouTube clips to show the candidate.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, immigration was the focus.
The subject is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed himself forward in the decisive polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation that he was yielding to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney by accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his house.
The two were particularly hard at work as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, succeeded in retracing this issue.
Neither of the two men has any serious chances of winning the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have hit the immigration spook sooner and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: stricter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations in the first place in a recent poll conducted in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was urged to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed at them and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa, along with Ron Paul's recent fundraising successes and his applause storms, falls in the debate of Wednesday.
These two have been shot up out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the greatness of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
It is not particularly slippery for British scandals.
No noble titles seem to have been sold, no politician paid Parisian hotel bills, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has covered up donations to the British ruling Labour Party for more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) under the name of other people for four years, and that the party has failed to report this, something would have gotten along well without the contested Gordon Brown.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister had withdrawn from the call for an election, in a stupid way insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls did not influence this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly perceptive leader of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once feared Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean has developed.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a battered bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The loss of personal data by the tax authorities of 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative fraud.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: to be a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the manifold donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and its former Head of Fulfillment) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably heading for departure.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it impossible to govern.
People neither like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for long, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to leak; the cabinet ministers are beginning to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In one way, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he wished to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-in-chief.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are linked to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's mishap - like the long "money for nobility" investigation of political party financing - voters may assume it was him.
Still, Brown's situation isn't as bad as it looks
The crimes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely cheated.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new urge to make political donations is a good example.
The garboeske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his goodwill.
It may be, but he was not entitled to make the decision.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial collector, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far Brown has not been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister's done half the work.
He has quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - to make the measure full, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, "the lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a thorough reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win voters back; and the only way he can achieve victory is through incontestable integrity and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis affecting America's credit card market?
If there's blood in the water, it's only natural that dorsal fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is ailing, predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both derecognition and default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or more than 30 days late.
Last month, HSBC announced that it had taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and defaults are still low.
According to Moody, the third-quarter default rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn account for a large part of the credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus default fees) would increase again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates showing how much of its debt consumers pay off every month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the 2007 output will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers take credit card debts, now that home loans dry out.
However, card issuers look at the flow of money rather than capital, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower’s creditworthiness.
They can even be of benefit to card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall when real estate is less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among the redemption priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of the assets.
"We won't wake up one day and reassess the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
When lower house prices and credit reduction push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former head of finance of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their requests on Wednesday into guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 drew the attention of Fastov to the fact that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claim that they came to Houston in 2000 to set up a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron powers that helped tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its shareholding in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the Bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely argued to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million dollars, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison term in Louisiana's federal prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and a month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was at liberty due to a $1 million bail, which required them to live in the United States awaiting trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the nation, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer make the billions of debts or weakening enterprises appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling serves a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were null and void after he passed away last year for heart disease.
Not at the bottom in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires' Exhibition, a four-day orgy of showcased consumption held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers had set up exhibition stands, hoping to interest new money Russians in everything, from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-covered car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"This is a nice car, but it's change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas did at its heyday.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and flocked to Europe where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab high-flyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world's most abundant donors.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week attracted a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, with a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a panel of experts here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the trade fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well cared for and the men are all worth a fortune."
While they are in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I try to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed primarily to target the newcomers, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to be stuck in traffic for several hours to visit a lean warehouse that pitilessly placed Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives made of platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, tailor-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears side by side.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted, blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper clippers."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer needs, said he had sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are similar to chained bracelets, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire that was designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-seater.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily be riding on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red telephone booths full of false million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed out 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around the piles of money, mobile phone photos, while they lean back in the middle of the substitute wealth, to have friends snapped, or just to take a few million.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Bold operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier Restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop at the white Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the medical coroner's van approaching," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, whom the police did not identify, and who worked at the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological tests, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help solve a mysterious death that has sent a grief to the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and persistent," Mr. McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine if Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical treatment.
"That's one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3:00 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the ground.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say if Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday nobody opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a withered rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find his way into provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that'," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to a rise in world stock markets
The stocks jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm down the credit markets by further interest rate cuts, were encouraged by appeasement comments by the vice-chairman of the US central bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Central Bank, said that politics had to respond "flexiblely and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm dreary markets, faced with signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October".
If the increased turbulence persisted, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The statements also helped calm Wall Street down in the face of further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that sales of U.S. real estate reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were underlined by Bear Stearns, the investment bank,’s announcement that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a cost reduction measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader-based S&P 500 index rose by 2,65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of UK defaults.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressure on markets had been underlined after strong demand for a three-month auction of the European Central Bank’s guarantee funds granted to the European Commercial Banks was given to a considerable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and feed further capital into the money markets in London increased when credit tensions were seen to increase the three-month "libor" rates for lending between UK banks at 6.59 percent to their highest level since late September, after a continuous increase since November 21st.
England confronts decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to be number six for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, at least under this special title, is here to help the head coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide to do so, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling up with applications for national electoral offices, if not for some part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth bat position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly it.
It is never easy to nail down exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of happiness rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket, where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same can perhaps be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good qualifications who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a bat must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the pickers is more complicated.
There were many who were better than last season, for example, when James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explains himself to be healthy and how the wind rushes into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or maybe it doesn't make much difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to consolidate, who made the breakthrough to become a major test cricketer and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that after another discussion at today's net meeting at Asgiriya Stadium, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, speak of an excellent balance against shot-on bullets.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the voters as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing from his beating, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex enjoys life by shovels.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket spot and his attitude aside was brought to the point when he had recently flipped over a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and with enthusiasm to say, "Did you see that?".
Bopara is a much better fielder, he keeps his middle pace with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time another.
Maybe this is the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah might not look good if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he's the one who's going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people running out of funds or visas, and others hoping that the city would return to normal.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia, supported by the United States, helped to expel Al-Qaeda from its bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shi'ite tribe who had been expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand grenade attack after having called on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He was coming back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaeda militias in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. increase in troops and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens" who were armed and defending their neighborhoods in cooperation with the American military.
But more talked about having been forced home by visa problems and dwindling funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed the general suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis to stop giving visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were driven out of Shia residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will fuel sectarian tensions and conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarlander face the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday for the 50th time I explained to a non-Aarlander that we are not French" - this slogan the smallest federal state self-ironically posters on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which ranks fifth in the Education Monitor of the Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln (IW).
Thus, the universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
But also the state children bring Saarland in above-average numbers to the universities - many of them without a degree at the Gymnasium.
"The vocational education system is used in Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquires their right to study at a vocational school, meaning that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are also comparatively strongly developed.
In terms of population, the provision of dual courses is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms in the general education schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced national comparative tests.
So that the children can start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge - a model that other federal states are now copying.
Whether the performance of the pupils will improve in the long term will only be shown in future comparative studies.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of students at risk shrank from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And to the annoyance of the Saarlanders foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area one could otherwise score points.
Because the language of the neighbours is mandatory for high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez changes the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez has the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
Meanwhile, in Spain Chávez becomes a joker.
According to a new law, Venezuela’s Official Journal reports that clocks are set for the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The US enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by imposing on the world the division into time zones to full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) about a hostage affair the break-up of relations with the neighboring country Colombia.
The left nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this because of my dignity alone," said Chávez, who is pushing ahead with a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The dispute was triggered by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe spat Venezuela "in the face" with his decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Chávez is also on everyone's lips in Spain.
A new cell phone ringtone causes a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the sentence that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
Spain's King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who at the most recent Iberoamerican summit was annoyed by the constant interrelationships of the left-wing populist and had driven him over his mouth.
Germans Threatening 2007 Wage Minus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts gave a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees could expect less in real terms in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the rise in the price of food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper.
New burdens could also be placed on employees in the field of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not again be embarrassed to ask the federal government for loans or subsidies, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it became known that the price explosion in food and petroleum products pushed the inflation rate to the highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to the Earth than previously thought: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices on the Poles, as they also occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus are shooting at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "primordial soup theory", lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms in the ocean are said to have stimulated reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius sometimes prevail.
"Venus may be the devil's twin on Earth, but it's a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has undergone such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the beginning of the nineties no probe has been on its way specifically to explore this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighbouring planet with the Earth are greater than initially assumed," says the Esa.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second tiniest planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, revolves around the sun in just under 225 days.
But it revolves much slower around itself: A Venus day lasts 243 earth days.
Although Venus hardly reminds the Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
Both collected water that remained on Earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it accounts for most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but took Merkel into protection from the accusation that she was pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China also knows that," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown displeasure about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from among the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the Union's "show window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership has not only unloaded the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but has also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of both countries, according to information provided by SPIEGEL.
China’s head of government, Wen Jiabao, has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge the Dalai Lama’s reception as a mistake.
China rejects the Chinese position when European politicians officially receive the Tibetan religious leader, Wen Jiabao affirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against riots like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not discharge itself into violence on the streets, the Federal Minister for the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the serious youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to make sure that social explosives do not also build up and discharge themselves into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" published in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal, state and local authorities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This does not only concern the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this already shows first successes."
However, it was too early to give a clear warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs, such as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, youths had fought heavy street battles with the police over the past nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings burned.
However, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater efforts to integrate the German government.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, there was still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people with a migrant background under 25 years of age was "higher than average".
In particular, more training places had to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "social control in the families takes place".
In addition, many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents had built up here.
Kolat warned: "But we still have to be careful."
It was important to give young people the "fast opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet during the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in action, a helicopter flying over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the day before, a team of around 1000 security forces has been providing peace and quiet.
The police would go through as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
The night on Tuesday, some 80 policemen were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots were inflamed by a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of the young people.
In the realm of Angela Cloud
The Chancellor's far-off appearance documents that the coalition is at the end of its content - and that nothing can be expected of it itself.
Which country does this Chancellor live in?
After their bleak appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was powerful and low in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that should finally be governed by it.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is concentrating too much on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag, it has clearly documented to everyone how much their accusation applies.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a distinguished politician who flees to foreign policy and remains in the rough even there.
Example of climate protection: She praises the decisions of Heiligendamm unabatedly, but does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-praise - so much immodestness the CDU boss would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the phrase that the upswing is coming to the people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of talking the world over.
But in the realm of Angela Cloud domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of the low-earners?
She's got a few side sentences left for it.
It is significant how often she promises when it comes to the child supplement.
Merkel needs three runs to bring out a semi-even sentence.
It stumbles as if on foreign terrain, when it becomes concrete.
Attack Department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a hard fight - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already unloading on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This, for its part, counters with serious accusations: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegals," Giuliani counters and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed immigrants privately without papers.
The candidates are calling for an attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism we let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is strongly read by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", an interrogation method that simulates drowning, as torture.
However, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond the Iraq war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium applauds.
Once again, it shows where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, wrinkled and in front of the base and the television audience requests that he was still one of the advocates of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into the jest when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civil for the first time
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
That ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as Army Chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thus bowing to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as civilian head of state.
By resigning as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his swearing in, Musharraf, according to the Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, will lift the state of emergency and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
Last week, the Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with jurists weighted by him following the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of northern Waziristan, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy and four others were injured.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies is playing music again: the three band members of Harmonia revisited their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
On the occasion of the revival, a recording from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three seated gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of him, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in a white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in possession of laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, concentrates on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally blends into a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia plays music again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
While one may reveal here: Targeted demands revealed that the name was buzzing through the collective pop memory, but not so sustainable in order to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock was always more common in England and America than in one's own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Lifetime Achievement to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003, the hall saw in inquiring German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation, the surprise knew no limits.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy at concerts.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the foreign is one thing.
Memory is already overwhelmed with harmonia, because the trio existed for only two years and during this time also developed a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music under the promising name Cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler.
First they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and then gained a reputation as guitarist at Neu!, the then perhaps most radical German group.
Around 1973 Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as a refugee community.
Less ideological than in the Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
It's more like being an artist.
It is said that a pennant of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing association and a name for art was also found in the bulky waste.
Some things Harmonia held to it.
The first album was "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For so calm and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
Collecting rice was not only a matter of self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record set of almost 50 people, as someone thinks to remember.
Rother then wanted to push for harmony and practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flamming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as its very own German contribution to lively music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin.
Publicly subsidised, within the framework of the Woldtronics festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire spectrum of the influences of Krautrock on the following pop music.
Harmonia fills the blank of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's sentence floats with the most extraordinary sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you own the future."
There are pictures that show the producer with Harmonia in the Bauernstube.
Legend formation serves projections of further black-and-white photos of jumbled devices.
Before that, the three veterans are once again engaged in improvisation.
No longer by attaching microphones to the organ and to the drums to elicit unheard-of sounds from the instruments via self-made effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in-depth technical tinkerers.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and whisper under sound clouds and sing "Aaaaaaaah!" on a beautiful spot with Emphase.
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music schools (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Anyone who cries "'68!" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is not allowed to be taken out of silence even now.
Even the most natural thing on stage is thoroughly reconsidered.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob your nerves or give you moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
"The Hunting Party" and "Mörderischer Frieden" are two films dealing with the Balkan War.
But neither convinces.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and shooting, or they're too touching.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
The good news first: The war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because too many nice-inconsequential roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism made you want to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes a Hunted One" (Why do movie titles have to be as long and confused as train driver collective agreements today?).
He provides a wonderfully winkling presentation: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere, if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long been behind his very best times, but who has even preserved considerable remnants of the former charm as a ruinous monument to his decline.
But despite this trump card, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Mörderischer Frieden", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war movies.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from Kosovar snipers, and one of them immediately falls in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that the Serbs are not represented here as the sole root of all evils, the TV-flat film loses itself too quickly in baller and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "the Fox" could have been a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and another screenwriter (both in Personalunion Richard Shepard).
Because the stories resemble each other strikingly: Both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military cannot do and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the run-down cynic with heart when he's introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to insinuate him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
"The Hunting Party" finally goes down the drain when the reporters manage to do what Nato, CIA and all bounty hunters in the world have failed to do in five years' time in the last five minutes in the fast-paced process: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague would like to be called upon for crimes against cinema logic.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (for once they should agree) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political arrangements.
But the well-meaning and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I sympathize with the swollen forehead veins, indicating how exhausting it is to be evil".
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly those swellheads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq films were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always: When a star is drifting around the trouble spots or minefields of the world, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some film will probably still mature - the now considered classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder comes at home in real time on two screens, too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the lack of concern they need to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not being" or "the great dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't be good at making good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcastically distanced artist vision of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in horrible ways and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps criticism for Olympic rejection
The mayor's approach to Hamburg's application for the Summer Olympic Games has met with fierce criticism in politics and business.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
But von Beust urges realism in the assessment of opportunities.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described a waiver on Wednesday as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as great motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the momentum of sport policy would not be able to be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "which assumes a changed timeline."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund to apply for Munich for the 2018 Winter Games, expected for the beginning of December.
"For us, this preference means that we will not have any realistic opportunities in the period until 2028 that we have envisaged."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamt out for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to take a chance by burying the plans at this point," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application was also in contradiction to the statement of the head of the Senate at a reception to the general assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There von Beust described Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 "not as a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD citizenship faction accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put Olympia on the map and excluded housing," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always called for integrated planning for the small Grasbrook for Olympia and later use of housing, the CDU had set unilaterally on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had triggered a great enthusiasm at the time.
Hamburg, however, had failed at Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Those who combine the terms Sweden and Holzkiste think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wood crates manufactured in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue of works.
A large part of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes of 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now come to a sobering result: The six "Brillo Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén donated to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably also the majority of the approximately one hundred other Brillo boxes of the "Type Stockholm", which are circulating on the international art market.
The prehistory is intertwined, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were not (for reasons of cost) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo Carton Factory.
They were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably gave permission in 1968 to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, but these were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at the time were rightly entered into the art and auction history as authorized original andy-warhol-brillo-boxes with the designation "Typ Stockholm".
Some of them have made more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at Moderna Museet, examined the six museum-owned Brillo Boxes as well as three privately owned Swedish houses, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their chipboard plates were first primed and sanded, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the pressed chipboard with a paint roll without primer - moreover, it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious accusations" raised in the matter of soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, there has been a relentless silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up hiding in a hotel in Manila, demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not answer for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government-loyal soldiers had stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
About half of them were tried on Thursday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops locked the district around the elegant hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
As early as 2003, Manila's financial district was the main venue for the attempted mutiny of around 200 military personnel against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours due to the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
You now hold 20.05 percent of the share capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
Keep open the option of increasing the share of Versatel.
The move is intended to drive the consolidation of the German DSL market, said United Internet.
Before that, there had already been some speculation about an entry on Wednesday, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considers the shares to be only a third party, it said in the financial market.
The previous day, United Internet had already taken part in the mobile phone company Drillisch with almost 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
5.15 million shares of which United Internet has purchased for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies have started discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," explained a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies have created the MSP joint venture to take over the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of over ten percent of Freenet and do not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase the shareholding in Freenet AG, it was said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has been going on for months and is difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full-service customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch so far held directly 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will contribute around four percent more.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
