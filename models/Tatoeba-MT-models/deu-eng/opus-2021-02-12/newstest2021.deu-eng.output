Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his rapid reaction.
Motorcyclist overlooks biker
A 44-year-old car driver wanted to turn left on the Landesstraße 1230 towards Machtolsheim with her VW from Merklingen at around 9.30 pm.
She missed out on the 24-year-old motorcyclist from Nellingen.
In the event of a collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but still patrolled it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the patrolling process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Mentally, he steered his motorcycle into the green stifles next to the road and let it roll out without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
However, due to the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury at Bei and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming in Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
Security is monitoring the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positively for the corona agent Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to avoid further expansion, we have to take this step to protect the population," explained Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Before that, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with about 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
On the farm, infected workers were separated from uninfected employees, and the grounds are now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPDs gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of seasonal workers' accommodations.
"This can be bitterly avenged if such local infection events have to take place and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD sees this very similar: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, hygiene conditions at the workplace and living conditions in particular must be closely monitored.
This obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak had come "with announcement".
Aidenbachstraße underground station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the rail bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station around 4.15 p.m.
A passerby alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to initial investigations, a Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the 17-year-old group helped the fallen climb out of the track.
There was no danger of a train entering.
According to the police, there were clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old fled the crime scene at first, but his personal details could be investigated afterwards.
He was accompanied by his father and went to police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for extended data retention - instead of the planned ten weeks half a year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a quick amendment of the law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He considered it useful to make "urgently necessary adjustments in the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
But Seehofer wants the amendments before, so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgement, the report goes on to say.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it was only reasonable to examine whether legal adjustments were necessary if the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already advocated data retention in June.
NBA: Stripclub-Anger for Clippers-Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), a basketball pro from the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando, Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, however, he still attended the strip club Magic City in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN, is back in Isloation, is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these very wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Inc.) have the best wings in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday on Twitter that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
Thus the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to finish the Corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale starting at night on Friday.
Söder comments on the corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm; over a third of them have become infected with the corona agent.
The farm is now under quarantine and is fenced off with a fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer the more than 3,300 inhabitants of the municipality free Corona tests.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt assumes so far that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience bites": confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added: "He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "suffered by scruples of conscience and very much affected by the extent of the destruction".
In the event of a conviction, the prosecutor says the man is at risk of ten years imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Cathedral of Saint Peter and Paul in Nantes had been severely damaged in the night on Saturday last week in a fire.
The fire had broken out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect who was now detained had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent invasion of the church, he quickly caught the eye of the investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss the conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates fait accompli," said Grindel of the "Bild am Sonntag".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work for the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not possible to get around the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations that want to break into this phalanx".
However, he had doubts as to whether there was a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the business location of the Bundesliga in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "attempts to increase the balance of competition in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money would not achieve a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences between the first three clubs are already immense.
The other 15 clubs have an average household of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and stabbed it to the press instead of addressing me," said Grindel about the assumption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I've been very busy with that."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"I have handled the ominous watch present completely transparently and unsuspectingly.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He had never "made a secret of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"That may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a Dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have once again intensified by Donald Trump's use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday there were clashes between demonstrators and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by gunshots while a demonstration train just crossed a intersection.
Previously, clashes had taken place in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds of armed demonstrators marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor's death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student had been shot in March at a drug raid at her home in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who didn't even live there, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group that calls itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in mortal danger.
The police set up barricades because even the demonstrators of a white militia had formed.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot in a Black Lives Matter demonstration and died.
The police reportedly took a suspect into custody.
She has not yet given any further details on the circumstances of the action.
Mayor Steve Adler said, according to the New York Times, that he was, like many in the city, "unfortunate and stunned" about what had happened.
Protesters in the American metropolis of Seattle also clashed with the police on Saturday.
They set fire to a construction car in front of a youth prison, the police used glare grenades and pepper spray.
According to the "Seattle Times", 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assault.
A courthouse was set on fire in Oakland, California.
A small group of demonstrators smashed windows, shot down fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, the Oakland police reported late Saturday evening (local time).
The fire could be extinguished quickly.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to the police, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital injured.
In addition, windows were smashed in a court and a fire was set, as the police reported.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historic costumes defy Corona
Although the large sause was missing in the spa town, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organisers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city centre was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale burn, Rakoczy-Ball or parade, many of the Corona-compliant alternative programs got their money's worth.
"I think we have been able to spread Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, one would return to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historical ones alone were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So also this time in the Corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, observes the historical while strolling and listens to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
They miss the crowds that otherwise do not belong to Rakoczy.
But she lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic procession and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy Reitturnier shall take place again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant partly more work.
For Christina Gold, for example, who participates in the parade in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was on foot in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"It's more exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The Reiterverein had less to do, even if individual riders were on the way in the park.
"We very much hope that the Reiterquadrille will be held again next year," says Ulrike Waldhofen, the chairman.
She announced that after a break of several years in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will take place again.
28 Corona cases with Spanish second team Fuenlabrada
The Spanish second-tier football player CF Fuenlabrada is slipping deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from the vicinity of Madrid had flown to the city of A Coruña on July 20, despite the first Corona cases, one low blow follows the next.
By Sunday 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital, as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name to the south west of Madrid still had the chance to reach the ascension playoffs.

The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office investigated for a possible offense against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced descent of the club.
Players and other team members are quarantined in a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel or gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
Photos show how players would have hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was also not changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
It was neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, said that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The lawyer of the club, Javier Tebas Llanas, rejected the accusation of deliberately endangering public health.
Javier Tebas, son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, pointed out that the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" had not been breached.
Before departure, there were four infected persons until 19 July, but they were all isolated and did not travel.
Right before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, "five or six" other team members in the Corona test were positive.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the whistle, said Tebas Llanas.
Police have to catch horses pulled out at Dampfach
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, shortly before 6 a.m., a road user informed two free-running horses on the feeder between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld junction and the Theres motorway junction.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
Shortly before Dampfach, the officers were able to gain the confidence of the horses, and each of them had a rope carried along in the patrol car.
Pro cyclist Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin thinks about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am dealing with the framework conditions with the team as to how and in what form it could go on," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
In the past, he got up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a small daughter, I think: what if."
The professional biker admitted that there are aspects with which he is increasingly difficult.
"But it was good for me to learn from the Corona time what I have in cycling and how much fun I enjoy it."
At the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August), the time trial specialist enters the competition again.
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's streets at the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people the tour ends with the motorcycle fatal.
Even an 18-year-old pedestrian dies.
Schönthal - In the event of accidents on Bavaria's roads several, mostly young people died on the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was captured on Saturday at Schönthal (Cham district) by a car that came onto the back lane.
Why the car got on the back track was initially unclear.
In Upper Bavaria on Saturday, a 22-year-old on his machine collided with a horse-drawn carriage.
According to the police, he went downhill at Beilngries.
In a left-hand corner, he bounced against the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, a man was severely injured and a man was slightly injured, according to the police.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He had laid down on a road the night of Sunday and was overrun by a 42-year-old driver.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Schönberg (Landkreis Freyung-Grafenau) on Saturday, a 57-year-old biker hit a car in a right-hand corner, despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the remaining three people in the car remained unharmed.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organiser of the Biker protests against driving bans announced in August, Gabor Kovacs, the Minister referred to extensive investments such as underrun protection on guardrails and the de-enhancing of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a lot for the safety of motorcyclists in recent years," said the letter.
"The number of motorized two-wheelers killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011.
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be guesting at the Hessen, the former club of the Croat, on 1 August (18:00).
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only hard test before the return match in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the encounter is held without spectators.
"We are especially looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac explained.
Sporty, this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before moving to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-profile opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the match against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht-Trainer Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat at Eintracht.
In March the Frankfurters had lost the eighth-elfinal match against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Nearly 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof just past the lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known corona new infections has increased further on the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person is recovered and no longer falls into this statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the town of Hof.
Thus, the Hof area is approaching the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 deaths from monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
The severe floods in Southeast Asia affect more than 9 million people, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people were killed because of the strong monsoon rain.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzer rhinos in National Park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 rhinoceros died from landslides.
They are protected and considered to be at risk of extinction.
This year the floods are particularly bad, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New dwellings are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 displaced by floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm also stays in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house were also so small and like a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large apartment block.
Many homes are empty, but - as the government wants - they will soon be moved in from those who have lost their homes due to the floods.

Argentina rejects counteroffer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"That would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," said one statement.
"While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is calling on its private creditors to waive part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country is again threatened by the collapse of the state.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government remains firm on its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The latest inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May Argentina had not paid interest receivables of 503 million US dollars and had thereby slipped into a limited default.
Arriving at work - not yet private
"It's going great" - Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws this conclusion after her first days at the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfeldener Notariatstelle.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law began work, the normal day-to-day business has long been on full swing.
"However, I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time, of course, was not enough to move the centre of gravity from Regensburg to Eggenfelden completely, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been known to her.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she then again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection procedure for the vacancy.
Her home town of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her traineeship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stops as a notarassessorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered the doctorate in labour law - she took her first position as a notarin in Rotthalmünster in the district Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised for Lutz Feller's approaching retirement, she saw the right time for a full career re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has completely taken over the team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the Notariatstelle in the future - and immediately has a praise for the team of the firm ready: "It's going great!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
She has already made contact with a local institution in terms of kindergarten and crib places.
And everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging trails of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled by 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be adhered to, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer to the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators in Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games of last season caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
At BVB, Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation, hopes that, in addition to the normal audience places, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is, of course, a hit in the account if these revenues completely break away."
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is "well advised to take a stable side-length for the first time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need is limited to entertainment," explained Cramer.
The head of marketing in Dortmund praised BVB professionals for their salary cuts, which are intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary cuts have a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny Wonders: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packer butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 young people who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with less than a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early born that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Sometimes their skin is so delicate that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they would not be with voice - "and how", Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the holidays began.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theatre of the City of Aalen presented the students with the production "Das Heimatkleid" - and this via video.
The students were then able to talk via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation had been born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the lessons.
Although at the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional stimuli, the potential for contact in the schools can also be seen in the theatre.
"If we further improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: The TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
If the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup are certain.
The lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because of the Corona pandemic the field of participants is not yet complete, placeholders were used for the draw.
Due to the voluntary waiver of half-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4th or 5th September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If second-liga-Aufsteiger Würzburg reached the final, Sixty would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.

"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale at Comeback
Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21) in the semi-finals.
Last September, Thole/Wickler had played at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flüggen won a defeat against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: the tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, from the FDP's point of view, only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the radical iceberg in the AfD," said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday, after several hours of trial, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD faction in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long since been excluded," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he said to the "world on Sunday".
"It speaks volumes rather, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD".
Blume assumes that the AfD will again land below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD-Landes- and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the ban as a "secured right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD federal board had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz did not declare an earlier membership of the now forbidden far-right "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend) (HDJ) and of the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz is a member of the HDJ.
Sebastian Walter, chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburger Landtag, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
This decision neither weakens the federal party nor weakens the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troops is clear.
They want to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD won't get rid of the ghosts she called.
An expulsion does not change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn, commenting on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the faction held to this day to their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz' membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the grid operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet grid area, have fed in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, wind power from the North and Baltic Seas comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms increase production capacity
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full power, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections," said Tim Meyerjürgens, Managing Director of Tennet.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record date for this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Kunst "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th anniversary.
Gmünder Kunstverein's birthday: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest does not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We truly did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is for the parties involved economically - hoped until the last minute," said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partyless).
"But in the end we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
After all, if tens of thousands had flowed to the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much of a folk festival would have been left.
Moreover, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately.
Rumberg made love to next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winter Mountain Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories at four starts this weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with Weihegold and Quantaz at the beginning, she was not to be beaten on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen in the special on Sunday.
Also in the freestyle on Saturday, the Germans were clearly in front of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer on Quantaz.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first freestyle ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all the important four exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The Wormser University of Applied Sciences continues to fly: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" (DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung) provides a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start your studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Management Academy are evenly utilized.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in their training as air traffic controllers at the Worms University of Applied Sciences have been in the Air Traffic Management programme.
This year already nine students started.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, economic support is not easy for us.
However, we are confident that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS when signing the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proofing investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences, also underlines this: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's programme in Air Traffic Management."
The trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung was both motivation and commitment for the Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of aviation.
With the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students in the field of air traffic controllers of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, stresses: "With its focus on air transport, the University of Worms has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was closed for about 30 minutes on Saturday noon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford at 12.40 at the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve straight ahead and landed at the guardrail.
As a result of the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered minor injuries on the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient subsequently flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed.
Heil wants to test other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Law-enhancing is imminent.
But are they right, and will they abide by it?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other industries in accordance with the now planned strict regulations against grievances in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for the industry and then take appropriate measures for the industry, if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the massive Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet intends to adopt a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ third-party personnel during slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of work contract and agency workers is to be prohibited there.
employer president Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and employee leave, if one does not want to completely strangle the economy".
For example, for large areas of the craft industry, the construction industry and plant construction, works contracts are the basis for their added value at the customer.
"The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Contracts for works were reasonable.
"When an industrial enterprise instructs a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and agency work to be unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It is not possible to explain why in the future different labour law should apply to portioning and packaging cheese than to sausages, according to a statement on the bill, as the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday) reports.
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from factory contractors worked in the industry for some 16 hours a day, according to the results of an examination by the NRW Labour Protection Administration.
Often they didn't have a break.
Salary was retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, they had been bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now it's time to clean up."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we intend to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher health and safety inspection quotas or clear criteria for collective accommodation".
The draft presented to the dpa includes amendments to the law on the safeguarding of workers' rights in the meat industry as well as to the law on health and safety at work.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nunnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to make even more inspections in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport," said Nunnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg up-to-date".
However, more staff would also be needed for more controls.
Three dead in the crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people died in the crash of an ultralight plane on an apartment building in Wesel in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
A child was slightly injured.
Two more people were saved in the accident, said a spokesman of the circuit control center Wesel.
According to the police, a parachute had been found at the site of the accident.
The "Rheinian Post" reported, referring to eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a single or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Evacuation of Frankfurt Opera Square proceed peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the Opernplatz took place peacefully in the night on Sunday.
Finally, a few dozen people stayed in the square, but left him at 1 o'clock before the curfew began.
The police had been in action since the early evening with numerous officials, and a larger police force was on display throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend from midnight there was a ban on entering the Opera Square, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of those celebrating.
At least five officers were injured after police entry and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night on Saturday was also quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in an accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries around 1:25 p.m. on Sunday.
She was taken to the clinic in Kassel.
With thermal cameras, the fire brigade searched for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was heading towards her hometown Hümme on Bundesstraße 83, when her car came off the road for unexplained reasons and overturned several times.
In order to save the victims, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether there was anyone else in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the lathe with a thermal camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for persons.
However, the operatives did not find anyone between the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured was taken to the Kassel hospital with the ambulance for further care.
Almost 50 fire brigade personnel from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin champion in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, Rekordchampion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto of the club history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night in the home match against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo hit 1-0 before the halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which without the recently injured former national player Sami Khedira, was no longer able to take first place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
The second Inter Milan table is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo hit with the last action after a free kick variant.
A play by Miralem Pjanic, the 35-year-old directly used a flat shot (45.+7) from the penalty limit.
Ronaldo was also involved in 2-0 against the now more offensive guests, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This ensured the glistening but decisive success.
The fouling meter shot at the latte in the 89th minute was probably only Ronaldo with a view to the goal hunter score.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and the momentum changes very slightly," explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve was most recently also due to the weakness of the competitors due to the calming lead at the top of the table.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed to win five victories.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo will still be the top scorer.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile already has 34 hits in his account after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The current juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next chance to win the title.
Juventus is in the eighth-finals of the Champions League, but on 7 August he has to make up for a 0-1-back match in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: more than 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened sentences and court sentences, drivers continue to gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the speeders are increasingly working for the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The races were less about organized events, as the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtag-SPD shows.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously competed against each other or they had taken the run from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 sat at the wheel.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually rising.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and reported more frequently, said one ministry spokesman.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Drivers always slow down traffic there in order to get space and use the free track for a race.
Last August a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "racing track"
On the A81 the police even registered more races than on any other highway.
With a speed limit it is tried to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between narrowness and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped sports and luxury cars often have Swiss registration marks, because the drivers dodge to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you were not still legally on the road here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more".
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or image campaigns: "If you ignore all rules in such a way and risk not only your own life, but also the lives of other road users, you can hardly be reached with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the routes concerned.
Not infrequently, the high-touring power show becomes more painful and consequential serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were reported to have raced there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bounced against a garden wall and remained lying on the side that 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the last two years.
However, according to Minister of the Interior Thomas Strobl, sharper penalties are not necessary: "The need for legislative action in order to penalise illegal car races more severely is not seen," says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Bluelight of July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Kreis Calw) and stole drinks and cash.

In fact, he wore a black hoodie, black trousers and bright shoes.
The police will receive further evidence.
Ackermann sprints to victory at the final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann won his second day's victory on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate from Team Bora-hansgrohe won a mass sprint on the 109-kilometer-long section with start and finish in Sibiu, after having already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season's three and four victories for Ackermann.
In the overall classification, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had decided the mountain time-trial in the morning confidently and thus took over the top in the classification.
Only 104 riders had left in the evening at the final stage.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a win," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish, he simply put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
In accordance with the rules of the UCI, a Corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race on all race participants and their companions.
During the complete tour, drivers and carers were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control centre gave instructions for lay reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment house a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call was received just before 1:00 p.m.
"A dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay reanimation," said a firefighter to BILD.
The arrival of the rescue forces took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child in danger of death was transported to the university hospital under reanimation.
Why it happened is unclear.
The police routinely started the investigation into the accident.
The firefighter: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized Tuning Meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people participated in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police implemented their announcement to increase their control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Mittelfranken, an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße was found by the Nuremberg traffic police at around 10.30 p.m.
The police then carried out a variety of vehicle checks there.
Just recently, the police had announced their intention to step up action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers were among the top 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police report.
However, only a small part of those present were assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene followed the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly showmen.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the current infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-to-nose protection.
The on-site control measures were completed at 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found that 10 vehicles had undergone such structural changes that the type-approval had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
Illegal car races did not exist.
"The Central Franconian Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, including in connection with the emergence of showy people," it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the involved towing company: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
That's what special tapes would be used for.
Also because the cars are wider, the company has to be careful not to make any damage.
"After all, the young people are supposed to get their cars back unharmed."
Figures from the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) investigates around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work pay.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, CEO of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the exam lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
That's why we're going to look at the final statements.
I'm sure there'll be a lot more to do.
We are not naive and have a long breath."
Evidence of abuse often comes from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more bankruptcies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we prepare ourselves in case of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money."
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection had been disbanded at 8.48 p.m. by the drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people would then have left the park.
On Saturday evening, some youths would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the Parks of the Foundation, there are repeated accumulations in which the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19 bypass regulations are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without corona regulation, the parks are closed at nightfall.
The camping on the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties in Berlin have reached a different dimension.
5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party in Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln on Sunday night.
The event was disbanded by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected young interns are in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday guest has been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the Tourist Board Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Also some guests left prematurely.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist town in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections had become known to the public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the conduct of interns who had celebrated in several places and might have been infected there.
"We all liked doing this in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15th were contacted.
The eruption evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party town of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of corona propagation throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the final day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured third place in the league with a 2-0 (0:0) win against Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle down with the Europa League, because Chelsea FC passed by and qualified as fourth in the league.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead through a penalty shot by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the follow-up season Jesse Lingard (90.+8) scored the final result.
Chelsea, in the Champions League final opponent of FC Bayern, won in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also standing against Arsenal in the final of the FA Cup in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, who passed the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and finished sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the distance duel with Watford FC and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time for class support at West Ham United.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) immediately compensated Andrej Jarmolenko (85.).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which had three coaches in the season, descends after five first league years.

In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team barely missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle tour in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," said goal scorer van Dijk after the match, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Because of the Coronavirus crisis, football in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there was even a discussion about an early termination or a performance of the remaining games on neutral ground.
Finally, the season could be played without special events - however, as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against head of government Netanyahu are getting more and more violent.
During the night, violent clashes took place.
On the night of Sunday in Jerusalem, the Israeli police violently opposed participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative head of government, Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld reported.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disband the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6000 people gathered near Netanyahu's headquarters on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's dealings with the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in an area demonstration who supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news page "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police reports, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on protesters on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu was also criticized for handling the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is faced with premature relaxation and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has seriously affected the country's economy.
The unemployment rate last stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently increased to record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen caused nine light injuries.
A motorist was on her way with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "Probably she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn."
The driver of a Mercedes transporter driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He hit the back of the car.
In the accident, three passengers in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea locks border city after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the corona virus as a "shining success".
Now the country is reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official corona case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
The state of emergency was imposed on the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership called out the highest level of alarm.
If the suspected case were confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea had not registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as "shining success".
The data were doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reported to have been found in a "outlier" who had illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had moved to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation of the crossing of the border within the four-kilometre-wide and largely mined military buffer zone from South Korea.
According to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations were underway on some individuals.
North Korea reportedly called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo, chaired by Kim Jong Un, on Saturday for suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster."
Kim had already ordered as a preventive measure on Friday to "block Kaesong completely and isolate each district and the region from others," he continued.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her, had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the "outlier case" as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
According to estimates, about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Excitement before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still under discussion before a great summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committees will also vote on the development plan for the large urban development-east project," it is rather casually stated in the middle section of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, however, the appreciation of the eastern city is controversially discussed until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently in individual committees even negative depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) to not let the project developed by the citizens and then by the administration and municipal council fail now after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "extraparliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", "vilification" and "conscious false statements".
"Everybody thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council as the only representative of the Pforzheim list of citizens for the past year.
Indeed, after reading the Treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The city would be cheaper to leave, the Technical Town Hall, contrary to statements by the city administration after subsidies, whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop in a very different way than the city hall and the economic supporters predict.
To shape the city by its own strength and not by an investor: that is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the open keeping of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-Thales for administrative areas and a smaller-scale inner city remodeling ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a key role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including speed reductions in many cases.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise by neglecting regular bus services with thinned-out cycles and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession to the Climate Change Pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the city's children's day care facilities and the application for admission to the federal smart city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must take corona protection measures into account.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31 with almost half a year delay.
Before the league of super sports cars can start the regular operation, the first test drives were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 more closely.
For a long time, the Corona crisis has prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first mission in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps on the Lausitzring and got used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go in the curves differently.
But it really was a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman has been able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings with it new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring".
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From July 31st, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the track however.
In 2015 he was last guest at Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track very little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is, it turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams are playing a little poker during the tests," he says.
"But finally we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the prelude to a crowded calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
Current stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will reach the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine decision
According to press reports, the British government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's Minister of Transport cold.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues at home on Saturday decided on the measure.
Because of the rising number of coronas in Spain, the London cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the deadline holiday, only from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain has been considered one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of quarantine for holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps."
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the end of the severe curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists blame the nightlife for the renewed expansion.
Spain is one of the British's favorite holiday destinations.
The British Government is currently recommending that the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular among British holidaymakers, should not be required to travel to the Spanish mainland.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Marine Day in his country that he would equip warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons, unique in the world, Russian naval forces would expand their fighting capabilities, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defence also informed about successful tests of the Zircon hypersonic rocket built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
It was said that it was also built on the atomically equipable underwater torpedo Poseidon.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also sailed on a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated nationwide by sailors.
In many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces also celebrated the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated its strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
On display in a video published by the Ministry of Defense were not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" Reaches Texas: Help Difficult because of Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has come across land in Texas.
Life threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. climate authority NOAA reported on the night of Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called a state of emergency for numerous districts.
The corona pandemic, which is rampant in Texas, makes the work of the helpers difficult, says Abbott, according to the US media.
Evacuated Called for Caution
"Every hurricane is an enormous challenge," says Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
In view of the hurricane in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and exacerbated, considering that it sweeps through an area that is the state's most heavily affected area by Covid-19."
According to the Johns Hopkins University, some 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
As a result, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, emergency shelters should be tested on Corona.
Damage had initially been reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit by land on Padre Island just off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest-level hurricane one.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning had been issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" continued to move inland and to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" is moving towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, hurricane Douglas was heading for Hawaii at wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour at night on Sunday.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to weaken further.
It is predicted to be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Above the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November up to ten hurricanes could be expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the authority had explained.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, and one below average was only 10 percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government closely observed the storms and was in contact with the affected states.
Four goals cancelled: video assistant "punishes" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic were eliminated two goals at the same time
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals missed: Sassuolo Calcio had a black evening at the 0:2 (0:1) SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of not given gates for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never gone so hard against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had gone through a goal of defending champion Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute in the lead, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the balance.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back because of a side position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - the VAR intervened again.
Also the goals of the attacker Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) the referee team took back after notice of the VAR.
In the follow-up season, Allan made the 2-0 final for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology creates records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start into the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winner FC Bayern.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who, behind captain Manuel Neuer and middle-field boss Joshua Kimmich, has the third most minutes of duty, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive king-class duels.
In the Munich Schmuddelwetter the right defender broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unqualified regular has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A bet in the eighth-elfinal back match against Chelsea FC on August 8 may be difficult, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on August 12 in Lisbon.
The Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
Flick named in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be shown by his title collectors who are hungry for victory in the ideally following 28 days until the King Class Final on August 23rd.
"We have mastered the compulsory tasks with championship and trophy simply excellent.
Now it's time to create something special," Flick said.
Until Munich can deal with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve in concrete terms, the eight-elfinal obligation against Chelsea FC is due for the first time.
After the 3-0 in the final match before the Corona break, the Londoners were not to become the Bavarian nightmare again in 2012 like in the lost "Finale dahoam".
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and fuel confidence with a good game," Flick demanded.
A test for tuning is due on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, on a one-time August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the court for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has done well like all the new ones," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer only allowed to train, Flick much prefers to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, they are now training in team strength for the Londoners, who are in contrast to the flick ensemble in the game rhythm.
In the semi-finals, Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
One way to the finale in Lisbon "is not that easy", stressed the head coach, who from Tuesday can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know about such a lot of joint tournament preparation, which is especially important when it comes to 0-on-100 tuning.
Working with his current team is "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the performers were there, including Thiago, who wanted to emigrate, and David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not guaranteed beyond the king-class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
All the American races, however, were cancelled.
The racing calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more racetracks were added to the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far during the week.
In October the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão in Portugal will be driven.
On the first of November Lewis Hamilton and Co. are fighting for World Cup points on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
This means that the race calendar 2020 comprises 13 races according to the current status.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the top class of motorsport will be completed in this exceptional season.
Formula One will finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the officially planned races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports indicate that there could be appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules require races on three continents
However, the Formula 1 regulations require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
By means of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the titles on the basis of "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the onset of the Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Rejection meets Criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," Carey explained.
The cancellation of the American races was particularly criticized in Brazil: "The cancellation was not surprising for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Furthermore, the concerns of some teams not to drive in Brazil would not justify a rejection.
It was prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in Stephen Colbert's well-known latenight show via video and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate Atticist Greta Thunberg was a video guest in a popular US Latenight show.
Among other things, she told of her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenage girl also talked about her famous "evil look" in her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said, shocked.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children goes out on the streets" she had experienced.
Heads of state and leading politicians who ridicule or even try to silence them in social media find them "funny" because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she took a bitter look after US President Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the aktvistin sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive look was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at this moment?
In response to Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick answer and disappeared briefly laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chances to become the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional scored three goals at the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalty points in the replay times of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old from the fourth place in the league has now 34 goals in his account before the end of the season - just as many scored by Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the season ended.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now blues rock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: Peter Green, co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, is dead.
He had died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, told family members in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the band in London in 1967, and his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" remains unforgotten to this day.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for charitable purposes.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems are also said to have played a role.
Green left the band three years after it was founded in 1970.
It was followed by a social descent.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, according to biographers.
For a long time Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the street for some time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
Already at a young age he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
He was hired by the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the blues boom Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media rush, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly succeeded in a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green didn't make a big comeback until he was re-launched in 1996 with a group of friends.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke at that time of a rock star who returned to Earth.
Free of drugs, Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
