A Republican Strategy to Oppose Obama’s Reelection
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by affirming that electoral fraud is less common in the US than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republican lawyers have, by the way, only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the conduct of elections in the individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have promulgated new laws that make the process of registration or ballot more difficult.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the November 2010 elections, with 675 new Republican representatives recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time limits for early voting, invalidate the right to register as voters on election day, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a court file is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the last two years, they have been promoting bills in 34 states that force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are regarded as voters who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs, who choose more for the Republican side, to use the tickets issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws demanding voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic voices.
For it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators promoted laws in eight states that abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections have helped to register some 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the proportion of new voters registered in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, although they make up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, whites, representing 76% of voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Advocate General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the passed laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the key states for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center in 2011 shows that those states that have passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral panel to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PPE test sometimes has faulty results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
This leads to more hesitation among men who are already indecisive in carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have received the opinion of two specialists.
In the US studies, there were numerous disruptive factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that if no early detection has been performed, the probability of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher after 12 years of follow-up.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years, if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin also have a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient really needs to be made aware of the extent of the risk of his or her cancer by identifying the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active monitoring and treatment as the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should and who should not be treated are being determined with increasing precision.
That is why I still recommend carrying out the test.
Most important, however, is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PPE test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, about 10% of cancers are thought to be caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
The fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority for the Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It greatly damages people's health.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the speaker André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, colon, rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," he adds.
Nutrition
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of developing Grimm or rectum cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preoccupations.
"The execution of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused a certain sensation last summer, and for good reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or "least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but not yet observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but data is still missing to be completely secure.
Nevertheless, let's assume that it's actually the Higgs, because there seems to be a low risk of being deceived, and let's look at what it's all about.
There is an inevitable law in this world, which means that two objects cannot be present in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and do not try too hard as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that for it, too, such a law applies: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantity state", whereby this "state" consists, by and large, of some of their properties.
From this point of view, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons, a vicious gang of anarchists, to whom nothing is sacred - in any case not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure from the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely amazing by the way): the mesons, which we will not treat here and the "force particles", through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it has to be stressed here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly in this place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbing" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, has to be "disturbed" so that this boson shows up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little like a frozen pond whose surface could only be shattered by a very large rock.
That's why a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a piece of paper would never keep on its own at the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (such as the photon) have no mass.
What can all these researches be "good" for, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to examine all the differences between the observations and the predictions of the SM in detail.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who are keenly hoping that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It has to be said that the latter still has major shortcomings, as it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (renewed ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Impact
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there are none.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous-line laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was initially regarded as a "laboratory plaything".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also arise from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras around the world and awarded him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With its Committee on Death in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate will have to be resumed shortly, even though a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had given him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the palliative care home of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees to be helped with the food.
He even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois' home.
Returning to childhood is unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
"That depends on the person's ability to take a step backwards," he notes.
For according to several people who work in palliative care, great events take place in the midst of these retrograde steps.
Patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who take care of them no longer overburden them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But the illness really made me know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more desires in life," she says before accepting that she should be put on a mask to help her breathe.
She still expects a last visit of her son, who comes from Italy, in the next few days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers offer body care and food support.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if you take into account that one day we'll all die.
Here, life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with brandy or pepsi according to his wishes.
Diabetic patients no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," reports Nursing Director Nathalie Savard.
Victor-Gadbois's home isn't a day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family reunion in the yard and is well supported by his pillows while in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel, worried.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois' home come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, are more or less exclusively specializing in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care that causes a number of palliative care specialists to look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide with concern.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent palliative care personalities such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's healthcare system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before they are accepted to go to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room with great pain for 14 days without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients bitterly until the last day despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she stopped an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I gave up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not accepting this request after their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent during pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care for the Montreal community, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in the patient being put to sleep either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly be able to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be eased."
This report was possible due to a journalism grant from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials from the Road Construction Office, main construction companies, political party funders and Italian Mafia specialists tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafias are involved.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has disintegrated since drastic action has been taken," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former head of Montreal Police.
The scandal was revealed by him as a result of an in-depth investigation into the embezzlement of the Quebec road works contracts, which the then Prime Minister had reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties, and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he stresses, "the Department of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts," because some of them were reticent about getting their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping that she will succeed in "showing the tactics behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops to accountants, investigators and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau" force, which since 2009 has made the Montreal Canalisation Cartel more cautious in the artificial inflation of the treaties...
Over the last few weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly accused.
The latter caused a stir by explaining to the Commission the operation of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years, he himself has paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambia had his hand everywhere in the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fund raising for former liberal vice president Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of 736,000 dollars in return for sewer contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other officials at the Road Construction Office have admitted that they were being smeared by artificially inflating bills with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal deputies to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a municipal property in 2010 that was purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation that is ultimately being carried out, she says that "it draws on a thread that makes it possible to understand the functioning of the system infiltrated by ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the guilty".
She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive".
We are about to clean the wound, but we would need a Montreal-only investigation unit, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but above all he is concerned about the role of the "mandates who are aware of tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a share of 70% black money in funding the Quebec election campaigns, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak clapping-off of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "As long as electoral spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by getting to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages Quebec's and Montreal's international reputation, Mr. Duchesneau asks those who laugh at it to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not Barcelona FC!"
This season you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day, I make progress on their side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my playing level every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I'm not breaking out in enthusiasm.
From my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The newcomers this summer are used to playing very high levels of games.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to stand up and want to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti gives respect to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has placed in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of the leader.
We're in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the eighth round in this way.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First we want to be the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the back match of the eighth final as a home match.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a big European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
The financial means are available to the PSG for this project to take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the Ligue 1 title, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really care about picking up this title.
Last season, we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
Normally you should be a master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right thing to do.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are struggling for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much of the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win 4-0 in a home game against Troyes, and you still find something that you can accuse us of, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we've proven strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that hasn't managed to qualify for the eighth round for two seasons, and has also spent huge amounts!
With regard to the sums invested, you were believed to be 15 points ahead of the game break!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores many goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from hitting out some playtime.
I've seen things there that made me stronger.
Today I manage to make good matches in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
We have learned our lesson from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we must show exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages victory.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a settlement.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Bleus to Brazil.
Is the draw forced on 16 October in Spain (1:1) a prelude?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has stood up for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
Bitcoin makes it possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as is so often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, Bitcoin's price fell five months later to 2 dollars before recovering to around ten dollars today (prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes exchange back) by playing games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, every time trade is controlled and handled by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all net nodes are simultaneously depositors of the accounting book, examiners, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file also make it possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public account account book distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of preliminary central banker, having the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a splitting of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is hacked.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
When this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without linking, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred millionth, leaving some room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with every improvement of the computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
By others like the blog platform WordPress they are accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in circulation.
A mega-final sale was launched in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul Company, which converts Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its Paytunia system is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented at dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are being reconsidered in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to assert itself, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
By the way, the ECB's report envisages reassessing the various risks, which are now considered to be high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished the Afghan farmers in particular by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and wounded.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees financed by French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoys flying over by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban inflows into Kabul.
Conditions have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overtaken by war due to the struggles of the various rebel groups.
Their seizure of power was then regarded as a kind of liberation and a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by confiscating government property to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive US subcontracting.
They discredited themselves, and most of them were not themselves involved in the struggles.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as do those who have been able to take advantage of American subsidies: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls as well as boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose authority it will be seen as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralisation by the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which had existed since the constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
Rumor has been spread that Afghanistan has immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
No mining is possible without energy to process the iron ore or copper ore on site or without means of transport for export over the mountains.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, have the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) do their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' gymnasiums, Institute of French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit activities and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "win hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, which required a large number of local workers, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2000 metres.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, it would be necessary to continue with less, more well-controlled and directly related civil aid in their favour.
A Constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever with regard to the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited authority, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this assembly two additional months to complete its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been relying on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "stepping the law."
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text to the Egyptians section by section.
It is also a way for the President to regain his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest rages throughout the country.
After confirming in an interview with American newsreel Time, Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this recourse to a hasty vote: "You either vote for my draft or I retain unlimited authority", the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 largely Islamist members of this constituent assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals have not complied with the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away, believing that they were unable to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities and civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed at the time of prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum clock of the constituent assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, finally remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of justice".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it possible to apply them more strictly.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Holyness" is reciprocated by the liberals, who regard it only as a propaganda strike.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which grants the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, since "the people who are asked to give an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
One can see here the first signs of a theocracy".
Liberal fears are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"Currently, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics, some of whom have been trained in the French system," appeases Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, that "with regard to Article 220, there may be ambiguity, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the far-reaching powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have called for.
The latter also share their fears about the text, which they regard as threatening freedom.
The situation of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no more article refers to the protection of women, stressed Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on TV last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists await holy places, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
To bow before the holy places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast, the walking on the water, the stilling of the sea storm and fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the sanctuaries are in Jerusalem.
Believers here follow the path of the Passion or the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path starts at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the church of the tomb on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
This is, according to the Christian view, the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes there with wishes that then come true.
Take a trip to the heights
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in A.D. 25.
They lie on a rock face in the mountains at a height of 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters, is the famous ski resort Hermon, which attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the mountaintop.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in caves in the Judean desert, as well as some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures by the visitors and bath servants of the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the memorial to the children, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the lands in which they died resound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing Something for Health
Israel's three main recreational areas lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three locations there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salinity and thus even carries non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt brine) and medicinal mud as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the calming of stressed nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
These secrets are hidden in the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia ran through this city.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
Tradition has it that Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets, which are named after zodiac signs.
According to legend, Fortuna is said to be the hold of all who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo events.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are performed today.
Tourist watch list
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is better taken with you in no euros, but in dollars, which can simply be changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a expressway and in Haifa the only underground line of the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper city.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which includes a change for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you can choose between different dishes with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this there are many well-fed cats, who wander comfortably and unmolested through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like busy places and don't say no to treats.
A rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance costs an additional 15 dollars a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recovery seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the visa requirement was lifted on 9 February 2011.
"The big and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money on language
While MPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already acting with fake certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families that remain in their homeland.
On 1 December, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to pass a test certifying knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme only applies to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in the retail trade.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests are to become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
Not only language tests, but also tests must be put into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be proven both for obtaining and renewing the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The total number of examination places will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the representatives of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question several times before the law entered into force in the press: What is the point of all this?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills bring about, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
In particular, speakers from the Migration Authority replied, the aim was to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelev, Head of the Representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical assessment encounter problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who, under the pretext of helping him, will put him in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of his like months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
Many complaints from our migrants reach us.
"In the homeland you are promised one thing, and on arrival you will be deceived, your passports will be taken and you will not receive the promised salary," confirms Tolib Schwaripov, Head of the Labour Migration Department of the Tajik Migration Authority.
Don't scold me, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, admit that they are not only unable to speak the language of the target country, but also cannot express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: only a few Turkmens, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford a reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school clothes.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to make money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect with regard to the law.
Only migrants with legal status must take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers continue to reside illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "forbidden entry for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A falsified registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
Russian police personnel know that our documents are mostly forged and we are not registered, and then there are cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says Tajike Umed Hushkadamov to journalists.
"Just don't shy away from the costs of false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be falsified.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by staff of the Federal Migration Authority.
The forged papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive it for nothing: every migrant who hoped to be able to spare himself tests thus paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Both officials and civil rights activists agree that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be bought easily.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test the first time they get time for a basic language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Ministry of Interior ignores illegal arms market
Very low proportion of legal weapons in criminal offences
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning to tighten up the weapons law for private weapons owners.
The authorities are reacting to recent events: injured in wedding shootings and seven dead in the rampage of Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov.
The police want to ban the use of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would shortly be submitted to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter has been published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - call on the authorities to refrain from "senseless tightening".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal justice officer, Vasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed during six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from using the black market.
According to the authors, any weapon for little money can be found in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel are illegal weapons stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen both from police armory and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
Many military camps often experienced explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson in order to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, weapons manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not stand up to international competition and therefore squander arms under the hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own, sometimes artisanal production, as well as a mafia that organizes smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the share each of the five channels has of the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminal literature and publicly available data on arms portals.
According to investigators, most of the illegal weapons come from the army and legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there because of the "guilt of those responsible for their work with weapons," says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% come from theft of weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun store, who does not want to be named, assures that weapons found during illegal excavations have long since been bought by no one, because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get supplies in a weapons warehouse.
An Ensign buys a weapon, such as a TT-type pistol.
The weapon is issued and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police know everything, of course, and therefore, if they are unable to comply with the crime detection plan, they periodically make control purchases from traders who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Buyers and sellers most often find each other through acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested to come to the "Begovaya" station, where a person would be waiting for me to take me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The prize for the weapon I only learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," the sales consultant says. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there it is necessary to go and arrange with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who tells that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even getting a couple of rings right now about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the rings because he knows that I don't rat him out.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was pictured.
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," remembers the military officer.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, I'm going to the forest with the salesman, and we're putting a target there.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
Neither any papers are needed nor there are personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy a gun or rifle".
There, users give up their orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," user asks "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are getting on the net for the service.
People come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible parties accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranez stresses that you can finally go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are getting on the net for the service.
"People come like hungry fish in feeding and then end up in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to dig coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US Dollars
According to experts, the purchase of illegal firearms is likely to cost between $100 and 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" one can buy a gun of type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by middle-ranking guards.
According to official statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences throughout Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of reported cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the US
One in four U.S. youths sits behind Mc Donald's till at some point
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the US against low wages in stores of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will swell further or whether they will soon run out of air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of founding trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organised as a trade union.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on Black Friday, where sales took place in the US, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to hand-held crowds.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, struck branches of the chain whose target group is low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
On average, the goods in the Walmart stores are between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of Walmart's low-paid employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants in the Black Friday protests demanded wage increases and expressed their anger at the fact that the contribution to in-house health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 per hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raised the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about 1.1% more than they're now donating for pay.
If Walmart completely transferred the wage increases to the customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them this would be an increase of only $12.39 per year compared to today.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that protests have only occurred in nine states and that they have not caused any loss to the company.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in its shop from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart-Kassen on "Black Friday" carried out almost 100 million transactions.
In an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post, the company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees dropped out of work and that the protest action was just "another PR trick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart stores (which are not wanted in this progressive city and therefore so far nonexistent), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company is selling billions of portions, and yet you're not being granted sick days, and you're not getting paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour according to federal and New York legislation.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive city earns less than she does.
How it is possible to get along with so little money in New York is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths were behind the bar at McDonald's after school, but the youths still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they get along with this salary and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate governance from standing in the way of this goal and admonishing or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance doesn't make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high turnover of personnel.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councillor Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and yet you won't get sick days, and you won't get paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together to support fast food workers so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to The New York Times, this was the largest of its kind in the history of the US fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, of whom not all are employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain is only moderately outsmarted so far"
The theme of expanded reality, popular among followers of modern technologies, has been commonly perceived by the lens of special glasses lately.
First Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it became known that Microsoft had also filed a patent.
In a conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear, however, that the glasses were only a transit station for the company's scientists.
It excites the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What more can we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many things still play out on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) has been improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change that, work on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier.
And first of all, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- I'm sure it's not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because you don't always want to inform everyone by about your actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and concise gestures instead of sweeping gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How so?
For example, we'd like to ask you to hand you this bubble can?
They say it and point to it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and can't afford at the time?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors that allow us to capture reactions from people more precisely.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you make on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Seen in this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of algorithms have more work to do.
Not only the resolution along the X- and the Y-, but also along the Z-axis must be taken into account.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
Man's movements are extremely dynamic and, frankly, the current 30 fps are too little, especially for gestures.
In our laboratory in Redmond, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with a controllable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera angles to see how this helps us to determine a position three-dimensionally.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that, with regard to the application of technology of advanced reality in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in your uplifted hand on the road, but I think the most amazing option would be a "changing" expanded reality, in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and that is their strength (only you can see privates), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality by means of glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point to: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that expanded reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection pad.
She's very sensitive to pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "images in the air" something tangible, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is at the moment as weak as someone blows over the ball of hands.
There are also wrist bands that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outwit the brain?
Make it think it feels what it should feel when it sees something right now?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task that we will have to deal with for a long time to come, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain is only moderately outsmarted, and there are still many busy years ahead of us.
This is exactly what makes working in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: We are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg Avantgarde", which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
High-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, have already landed on the select list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is familiar with Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red, who is sometimes seen at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever Kirill Miller's paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street conjures a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and creates a good mood with them.
Recently, he grabbed a rotary organ and became a St. Petersburg rotary organ player because he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist life, his philosophy and his image.
Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in town, for example?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the grey norm causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace of Newskiy, where my work was exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonevzhina"; from this came "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was finished.
I'm attracted to theatre, fashion, music, actually everything except literature.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... and it was important to me to be at the center of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists were to gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there until renovation work there was a musical-artistic club for the bohemian, the house of the Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Sturd and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight jerseys, and among them was the today's hip composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, their "Leningrad" became.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have their origin in the art clinic.
Our employees and regular guests went there.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a poll in the press about the award "personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and with that I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In modern times, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be like that.
In a clown, all this blurs away and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by requiring everyone to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients himself to the outside and not to the inside of the person.
But maybe you can't give a man a hand, you should spit in his face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the city's organ player.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- Stas Michailov's performances are accompanied by several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people and not 10 thousand come, so there is less management, money, and everything perishes.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to betray them and not destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such pictures, which even hung with a collector in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually don't come until the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It's called spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, it's something completely different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
They say: Servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real tsars, because the tsars may not have understood much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some that could be experts, but they are blocked because they need higher-ranking experts to evaluate the former properly and clear the way for them.
Now all that matters is your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and that some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a suitable breeding ground.
It's hard for art to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's a lot less for us.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earth-dwellers on board embark on a search for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the important question arises as to how we can reproduce in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"This is Mars and Venus," says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in space.
The researchers first looked at the question of procreation in space in terms of flora.
Half a century before, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit did not differ in the least from the terrestrial species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely tiny fruit flies (drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to investigate how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
A normal chick is developing.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must find a foothold; it must be able to stand on its legs and begin to move," explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the Laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
Without a solid surface, the chicks turned wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely dulled.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later, they just died.
"We let chicks slip twice and then set the whole thing up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev notes about the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" only same-sex species will be found.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized and sent into space.
In principle, nothing special was noted.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but once again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats got offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could do that in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Will she survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawitzkaja, who was in orbit twice and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Still, there's a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where everything went well after long flights and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet mankind must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The hydro laboratory in the cosmonaut preparation centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Although adults find water to be pleasant, it is a strange environment; yet infants feel water to be a natural element.
It's as if the little Ichtyanders were testifying that life on the land descended from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother's belly for about 9 months in the amniotic fluid, and the fact that it is easier to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swim only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
Thus, while weightlessness is a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman cannot do without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles regress tremendously quickly and thus the ability to push the child out decreases.
All right, let's get around this with birth-seeking aids.
The birth could also take place, for example, in a special chamber to squeeze out the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valeri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the gravity, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in orbit like an adult for training in a stress suit.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person," says Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes reality when the Earth's inhabitants in their spaceships set out to become a distant planet that will be the home for their descendants born in space.
NKÚ chief: Control of the black system fails due to political faults
The Czech Republic has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but falls behind in their application.
Speaking for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office (Nejvy
"A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied correctly - and I do not think that is the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar conclusion appears to have been reached by joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he cites Prime Minister Petr Nečas' attitude to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply be the head of the government, and the supervisory authority, whose duty is to monitor compliance with the law, hinders its activity," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Committee on Control of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries concerning public contracts were compared.
What was that specific about?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a question of the European legislature defining how public contracts should be managed, on which national legislation is based, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have found very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even more "stricter and more perfect" for us, but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again. One must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project?
It is precisely this kind of joint control that could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect laws and reduce and level thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Profitability means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paper stuff", and those who seek gaps in the system have made it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems involved in the practical implementation of the Czech Public Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Court of Accounts, which is similar in structure to ours and also has a college which is only formed slightly differently. However, in principle both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. there are also these accounting offices in the individual federal states - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds, which are administered by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the state accounting authorities.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would hate to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, in some respects, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because the examiners are better there?
Certainly not, but as I said, I do not like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are an example to us are also facing problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything to do with our agency, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what importance did the amendment of the Procurement Act have for your authority, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novella is only in effect for a short time, it has not yet had any effect on our tests.
As our controls take place retrospectively, we must expect a certain delay here.
So far, we are more likely to experience effects during the preparatory phase of future controls - for example, we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of Risks of Uneconomicity" and with this we have examined and analysed almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will naturally have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be complied with.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to scrutiny are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the award law amounts to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out of here?
First of all, let us say which path is not effective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
After all, a law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the head of the government, and the supervisory authority, whose duty is to monitor compliance with the law, can hinder its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we pretend that nothing is.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best bid is excluded solely because of formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I believe is missing from us.
On the roads there are occasional frosts, but mostly they are dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there are snow and ice smoothes.
Most of the roads, however, are well navigable, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the streets were well navigable this morning, snow and ice were scattered.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should become a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
On the ridges of the Erzgebirge, however, there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road watch, due to fog, limited visibility prevailed.
The R6 expressway and the first-class transport routes in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes icy and smooth.
All roads of the second and third road classes, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, snow remains ejected or ejected from section to section.
Particular attention should therefore be paid to the higher levels.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of ice-smoothing, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes still an extended layer of snow on the roads, the road and highway direction on their Internet pages informs.
The majority of the roads warn drivers of ice smoothness, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
Ice smoothness can occur in particular on traffic routes of the second and third road classes in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies in particular on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické Hory mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies at altitudes on the roads of the Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov districts.
In eastern Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful today, and it remains largely free of rain.
Temperatures range between -3 and +1°C, with a weak wind blowing.
Pilsen district
The roads in the district of Pilsen are well accessible today, but there is a need for increased attention in the area and the driving style needs to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures subsequently fell, it can come on the roads to ice smoothness.
Fogs are also to be expected locally, but the visibility will improve during the day.
This information comes from the district roads majority.
The D5 motorway is practically unobstructed, but the road majority recommend increased attention between the 80th and the 131st kilometers.
The roads of the first road class are mainly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, there may be sections of ice smoothness.
The roadways of the second and third road classes are wet, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc district
Today, drivers who are heading towards the high altitudes in the Olomouc district have to expect snow mud.
After the use of stray vehicles, snow mud remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský k
Snow drifting by night forced the majority of the roads to use, in Šumperk County about 3 cm of fresh snow fell according to the road administration.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually unobstructed.
"In the Šumperk district, snow remains in the altitudes.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, the drivers in the direction of Jeseník have to expect snow," said a staff member of the Šumperk Road Administration today to the ČTK agency.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to leave at night, according to her data, the roads are free and wet up to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc County, the roads are unobstructed, but in Šternberk County, drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem district, Liberec district
In northern Bohemia, the majority of roads report several poorly accessible sections of roads.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústí n.K. is closed according to the traffic police.
Temperatures remain below zero even in lower altitudes, so that snow and ice will remain on the roads. However, no problems are reported from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian low mountain range, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disruptions have been reported so far.
Ice smoothness is reported in particular from the Štětí area.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Poor traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from road I/13 at the border of the districts of Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be blocked due to branches pushed from the snow load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy at our concerts
What do you think will happen in less than a month from the end of the world?
This is one of those disaster reports that we humans love to jump to.
With our band The Tap Tap we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It's a nationwide charity event that we've been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is predicted for December 21st at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, there will be three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us.
Who gave this idea?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we give this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with whose purchase via www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded, together with other performers, the so-called anthem against the end of the world with the title "The end of the world falls out".
Already today the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also be performed at the benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and that the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem is to be sung simultaneously by all performers at all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns will be broadcast live by Czech television in a direct connection.
The lyrics of the anthem are by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X also sings with...
How did you come to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We try to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us, and have fun.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the accessible education centre Studeo, which we have been working on for six years together with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
Students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be built, into which we then move in with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What criteria did you choose?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere perform with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find everything else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "large events" also planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at Prague Spring, and for this concert we will also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would also like to combine this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be carried in the luggage compartment. We also have to carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison of what the individual countries look like with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we have witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its early days in the East.
Opposite Prague Moscow is absolutely not disabled. It is still unusual there if someone in a wheelchair is travelling alone in the city center.
It is not even a matter of course that you leave a wheelchair user in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations there that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways must we catch up with the more developed countries?
There's still a lot of things we hang out with...
It should be noted, however, that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to be able to move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not exactly common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular right now, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started working as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, among other things, I founded a music association together with a colleague.
Well, and in time, as our moderator, L
But the band only became known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if one does something and this is not visible to the outside world, one's own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to get this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I sensed the potential that things can be handled differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression the viewer usually has is of course pity; that's only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop if they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed in something, it is not only progress for them, but for the whole of society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as many people say?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise on many things and also demand a certain discipline.
However, I believe that this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic performances, and when they find that they have rehearsals twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm of many quickly disappears.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: L.A. Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Who has the will and the desire to participate, is always welcome with us.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 21 o'clock
Venues include: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected via live circuit and a joint interpretation of The Tap Tap's anthem "The End of the World Falls Off" sounds.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the provision of a multi-functional educational centre for the disabled, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: CZK 25 million
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of the Space Agency at a Council of Ministers meeting of member states of the European Space Agency (ESA). Poland is thus the second member of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008.
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's way into space began much earlier, of course.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were concerned with space travel, but they did not always come across understanding of it.
I would like to remind you, for example, of A. Šternfeld's lecture of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Entgang zur Kosmonautik".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's world-renowned contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a railway-draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project were unfortunately unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or to brake the draisins.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with missile-powered missiles.
The research was carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents handed down that the research had progressed to the stage of practical tests.
The research was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, a photoelectric hunting rocket was published in the specialist press by Ing. Rohoziński, and the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky was published.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work, its work ended from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the creation of a space company.
At the time, there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was foreseeable that space exploration would have a future.
Already in 1956, the Polish space company PTA tried to join the International Federation of Space, which was founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member already in the autumn of 1956.
The following year the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice Chairman of the International Federation of Space.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, flight tests began with the two-stage rocket RM-2 in the B
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The first RM rocket was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed of this rocket (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport room with a capacity of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a takeoff weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
After that, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on charitable work.
This decision led to a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (wages) there are price tensions.
This term refers to a situation in which the producer tries to compete economically by importing good products by "underselling" the competition in order to gain a greater market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy it cheaply, or to give up their business.The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, public expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they cause to society as a whole.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates in the individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population to private capital, regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force one's own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the wage sector.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and on the other hand by curtailing workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, for some years now, there have been public food outlets for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already going into the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which employees receive such a low wage that the state has to increase its income to the minimum.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of auxiliary staff employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the EU's southern states will undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level, or to suffer for a hunger wage on the fringes of society, hoping that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here the question naturally arises where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital is completely absent, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or Africa in general, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists narrowly on its view that the state must not intervene in the economy by directing it.
But then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically all-powerful lobby, which is omnipresent in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual predominance, legislation in which virtually everything is criminal, but nothing is criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Ministry, in the absence of finance, entrusts private legal entities closely associated with industry with the drafting of draft laws.
These draft laws are subsequently adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence then comes no longer from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Evidently, the liberal democracies are now quickly in a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in Caesar's and Pompeius' times: "The state has long been in decline, and the offices have been filled with violence.
For bribes, by unlawful concealment of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew rampant, and the people went to vote with votes already bought" ... "People with character did not apply for office, so that the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "One really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a single rule, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with a single rule.
As it turns out, today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
By its very nature, private capital is not in a position to recognize and enforce the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, today and then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who are not at all seeking deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already emerging.
What is particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites are completely ignorant of the possible future losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, of the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing today, and of the crimes against humanity as we know them from older and more recent history.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state's participation in the economy, increase citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "...that we may not forget how fragile we are" .
"If my sons did not want a war, there would be none," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, numerous reactions.
Some support Israel and argue with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and call the state of Israel terrorist.
At this point, I do not want to write about who is guilty and who is a victim in these ever-recurring waves of killing; in the end, the present-day inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing areas, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
It's about opening the reader's eyes behind the scenes, looking at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small village of Land in the Middle East are above all useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and emerge from my own understanding of who or which group of people has a decisive influence on the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make up an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predestined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be called the head of the Kraken (I don't know if there is anyone above them, but I don't rule this out) - the Rothschilds.
There's not much written about her.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the 1990s in order to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in whose background always stood the strengthening of their power, the multiplication of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or prepare themselves for them (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Ghaddafi only four remained, with Russia in the meantime having subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to stand up to this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (i.e. state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, Rothschild's global desire for power led to the formulation of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert Spak, a Mason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was intended to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was intended to break the colonial rule of Great Britain in particular, and the third war was intended to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comforts and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the prelude here) and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds works at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the founding of the FED, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they succeeded in triggering World War I by the murder of the Habsburg heir Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Tsar Empire), and the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary followed.
In order to be able to ignite the Second World War more easily, the bankers had the politicians create a latent conflict situation by filling Germany with gigantic war reparations; thus they created the preconditions for impoverished masses, so that they had to subjugate the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, who offered the culprits named and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to take on the function of a fifth column and also took on the role to ignite the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, preferably in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke away from the chain on which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the declaration of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people, like in World War II, will become victims in the front line, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply people are divided into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power at the beginning?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, since the international bankers in Israel, as well as in our country, the people, only place their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist politician loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything in his power to spark a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly expand into a global conflict, and which could lead to the destruction of the world economy because of Iran's control over the only two-mile-wide road of Hormus, which accounts for 20% of the world's oil supplies.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their conception, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth with a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And it is made that the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, but he has the mark, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: he that hath understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the US after the revolution, who had maintained the patronage of his regime for decades.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to free the hostages only made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the USA a small partial victory.
Immediately before the embassy was occupied, six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, with an extravagant story helping them cover up their true identity - traveling with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff allegedly visiting locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by Tony Mendez, an exfiltration expert, also required Hollywood collaboration.
For the cover to become credible, articles about this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time it is also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
In this way the mood levels change in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
A smiling actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the thriller Kein Kinderspiel (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that made the previous films of this director stand out from Hollywood's standard.
However, Affleck also proves this sense in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the initial sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team also achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
However, he works quite successfully with the few, sometimes helping the reality a bit - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a telephone call in America, or the chase on the runway also seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide dispersion, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have deserved more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses some of its traction. It is a film that can be pursued with a certain interest and the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive to this day and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services are.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which carries out an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, decided this year to organise the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This was the idea of the EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% female quota in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013", said Nacher.
One of the controversial EU regulations is the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels which, as a result, are harmful to nature, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs considerably more expensive this year.
Criticism in the past also reaped the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the sale ban for conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member states (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks even with veto threats).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest commercial class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it only harmonises the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries, pointing out that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to balloons, must be provided with the indication that children under the age of eight may not inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred to an American study which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fair sturds.
Curious ideas can also be found at home
A directive that concerns European officials themselves is also relatively absurd - anyone who takes an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated the above-mentioned absurdities as well as the EU regulation on the level of food stocks in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that could be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
For example, the Czech Republic exceeded the fixed volume for canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or the idea of providing funding for applications for funding.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, of course, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU," said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and that the state warehouses were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, according to Palas, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission approached the Czech Republic to the extent that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), offered funding for applications for funding to the municipalities, which should specifically be used to apply for funding to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, some experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate, and thus also to make the European Union as a whole more effective and develop, deserve more recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced by individual Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
Emotions in this country also arise from the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this battle.
After a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar
The term rum may only be used for sugar cane distillate products, not sugar beet products.
The official list of products registered in the EU now includes the Karlovy Vary Zwieback, Carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saaz hops, in the company of the world famous Feta and Gorgonzola cheeses, the Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham.
The Pardubic gingerbread or Hořic rolls can boast with an EU mark.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If everything worked out in our country without any problems, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic being plundered for 20 years, the thieves running around freely, while people are being increased in taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I'm already over 40, independent and non-partisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for office as a senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then headed straight for the castle.
Doesn't that turn your back on your voters?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to start the fight for the castle after the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would run for president if I was elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people, scold in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we crush anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media that want to rob you of honor, and that confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You started the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive declarations of assets over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you have to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring in legislative proposals.
How are you going to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this has been enforced.
The problem is small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless person, I have much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country from every party without any drawer thinking and party dogmas.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me more on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely irrelevant.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You don't like anyone calling you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this.
We can call this populism because of me, but all the proposals I have talked about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you will only be left with keywords.
And you won't get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will be able, for example, to enforce material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties on live television to legislate on material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And then, if necessary, the people addressed would have to say why they reject it.
A strong personality who points to grievances can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the President, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I can't do anything alone; that's why I've talked to several well-known people about whether they don't want to run for the Senate, too.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who refused because of work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of those entitled to vote did not go to the elections at all, and those who left mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're just two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district governors.
Are you thinking about founding your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to review the past of any potential party member, and I don't even have the money to do it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset declarations, what would yours look like?
My private assets are estimated at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child's dream - I always liked James Bond driving in the car, being gallant to women and fighting evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign by my own means.
The campaign costs are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur in order to get your living?
Didn't you say you were going to go back on these activities?
But this is not related to the amount of the salary.
As promised, I partially withdrew my activities.
For example, my deputy will be managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and this continues to be the case.
As President, however, I would completely cease my activities.

The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the mind - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I think the building is funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large-scale operation, says: "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we need a library for today.
Everyone has internet, iPad and e-books.
No one's going to one of those old-style libraries on their own today, is he?
Spijkenisse, a sleep city that is hardly in need of a visit at the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands as a whole.
In order to counter this stupid circumstance, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro notes as beautifully pinned reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library had to be here!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of the ludicrous bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with familiar serenity and appeared for the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin in his face.
And while the jury was still looking around and twitching with the armpits, the cheeky Maas piled up his exquisite souvenirs in size to a pyramid and ended his action-based speech with the words: "Dear municipality!"
So this is my proposal for the Buchenberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is piled up.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This makes the faceless small town retort, which so far had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunnedly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: Bookeldorado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the real room and reading pleasures open up during the walking climb of the topography.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lights clearly speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally, the bookshelves stand along the façade, and in the middle lies a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and put the reading area inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and building technology center.
A special pleasure are the black bookcases, which are wall coverings, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase railings.
Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request from the standard.
And so one day, in a farm in Frisia, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands a millimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root base in greenhouses and in fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, after which it is ripe for bulky waste.
For the library, for the first time in these quantities, the fleece was pressed into plates four centimetres thick.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, load-capable material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-meter-long hike, the Literaturcafé not only rewards you with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and stuffed ficus trees.
They provide an atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology," Trouborst says.
It is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the Bücherberg stands under a glass fall, the sun shines only briefly inside even on sunny days.
The wide wooden glue ties, which stand across the glass facade, serve as shading and capture a large part of the solar radiation.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already ventured the way into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls Boekenberg Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal holdings.
This is intended for the first time to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has worked out.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just a decorative thing.
Thus, MVRDV has succeeded in the supreme discipline, which is called the identity foundation in the specialist jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in US-European relations, Berlin thus balances on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is changing its foreign policy, away from a policy managed, so to speak, by the US, towards a German foreign policy.
In addition, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still touching on their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy like France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to push the public, but also the elites, into the head in the Arab countries.
That definitely matters.
But I wouldn't want to give it too much weight either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect for itself.
After all, it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly declared itself in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that Obama’s government secretly has a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - does Germany even want to play a leading role?
Or is Germany still struggling to lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a larger role, various anti-German feelings become free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to a wide range of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is steadily decreasing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, who else is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they don't like it and make it even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Trademark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind it is a name officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the origin companies.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual namesetters do not complain.
And even then it's not clear if they're right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in IP infringements in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
A few additional letters are enough for imitators to register their brands.
So Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you let Prada-Kny enter.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14th, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected, an artificial name that was also used at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: On behalf of his clients, he opposes the fact that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
That means women fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury products with a volume of 15 billion euros per year and the fastest growing market.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected claims because after the long term the contested name had become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he even has to pay the plagiarist money because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also affect graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admitted that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and space equipment.
Last year, however, one had returned from the "emergency situation in the workflow to normality".
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 appeals are still pending in the office.
To tackle it costs a lot
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China is leading the list of applicants all over the world, the authority informs.
This also applies to the inventory of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was collected in fees.
Simplified means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
The case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows that it costs many times as much to tackle this.
The company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacturing of imitation motor vehicle parts was lifted.
But the imitator continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
One failed to do so, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trade mark office rejected the Munich opposition.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the opponent of the trial continues to fight today.
You have to be so careful.
The case is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely laborious and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive had to search even one hundred-year-old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement in vain.
"This shows how much it is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to return to Europe.
That's when imitators secure unprotected brands.
Thus a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since given up this business area, but was nevertheless able to avert registration.
"You have to be so careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners should "register everything that is somehow worth protecting, also in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was in the final act of his brand drama, one would probably have to pay royalties for one's own name to the other side, explains Wentzler.
Or we are being pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aid Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that crosses more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and men's slippers are looking for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - pressurize, beguile and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his shoes when he brings it together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers have arrived, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choir voice has a different text and this in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Helping to Help Yourself
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, which is estimated by Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans living in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
You can sponsor for 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a hot meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser on Zulu.
The Bantu language can speak fluently in this room no one can, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign, soft language and sometimes brings them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have been killed by the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, we see on a small scale what all of Swaziland is suffering from: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying in their mid-thirties is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
If you don't finish school, you don't have a chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to enable him to have a warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which has been taking care of the AIDS orphans almost professionally since then.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and Trippers are especially common among men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four of the five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - yet this group accounts for about 20 percent of new HIV infections.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged between 15 and 25 years.
Human papillomaviruses are also common in adolescents in this country.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain as well as vesicles or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially for frequently changing sex partners.
Diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and late consequences avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least the gages, which the choir sings itself all over Germany, a lot comes together.
"Overall, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans live well with one of the grandmothers, for example.
The Gogos, as the old women on Zulu are called, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school lessons every day.
Those who no longer have, come to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club just as much as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because, as obviously as the disease is all over the country, it is best to keep them silent and dead.
A King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned life form that the HI virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms exist on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels every two or three years together through the south of Africa and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many still know at the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already defied some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more known than.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light" people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometres as the crow flies to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it glowing there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet may be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the planet's permanently shadowed region.
This should be at least 30 centimetres thick and possibly even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one associates the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Undetected by Earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send images to Earth: Small peepholes into infinite expanses.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This image section of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: The oldest stars can be recognized as blue dots, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborns" in the Sternkreissaal.
This star-forming region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has been discovered by the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This shimmering glow of a dying star has taken in the speck telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star threw out in the death process.
In the huge Trifid nebula, 5400 light-years away from the earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
The spy telescope of the Nasa took this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiades cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors come better to the advantage.
Like a red age, the Helix nebula looks towards the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its similarity to an earthly continent gave this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these were created is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-divided, three-divided), since dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the star-birthplace three-divided.
In the constellation Serpent Bearers, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you might call them Southern Fire Wheel by their nickname.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows an excerpt from the iris nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The fog, which is 1400 light years away, consists of dust particles ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the Hubble space telescope for the Nasa.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle always produces new youngsters.
This star cloud, combined with the rosette nebula, also continuously produces new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it did not emerge until shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our Insights into Space: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever larger - and the insights they provide are ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows views into space right above two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is lashed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its special feature: the high power of light collection.
Despite the comparatively small mirror diameter, this reaches the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honors its name.
With its four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror should cover a full 42 meters - and be composed of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered to be the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, next to them, looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, are provided by the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been delivering images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets - primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
The image shows the last preparations for launch at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board an Ariane5 rocket at the earliest in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messengers circle far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
The scientists now have certainty through the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to revolve around Mercury.
Drink butter every day - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The ride through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles over the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talyshes, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijani and is very durable.
End of the line is Lerik.
The small town brags with too bulky architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the approach from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one-lane.
The fabulous wealth that the land owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to attract tourists.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here the vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area is documented, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
A child born at the age of 136
However, the museum's controversial star is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he was said to have fathered another daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov miscalculate at his age by a few decades?
Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
"A striking number of high-age people are also found in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documentation, no scientific evidence on age was to be kept, especially as civil status registers were missing.
Butter melted every day by cup
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik frequently reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyshes.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is a matter of nutrition.
However, from a nutritional point of view, the fact that the Talyschen's calorie-rich diet is supposed to be so healthy that they love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day does not seem perfectly plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik.
At the age of 97, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter keg that rolls her back and forth tirelessly.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both of whom are grandparents.
Two toddlers also jump around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in the typical, bulbous Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in line, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never ran out and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I haven't bought food at the supermarket once.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the period after World War II.
But everything got better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, which ruled its country like a dictator, knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old people.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), receives Mirzayeva monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son, who has long been grayed out, is right: "The elderly enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as its base is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
For they all, so far hopelessly disputed in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God-state on the Nile by the graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He, as Mohammed Morsi said almost apologeticly, temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are aware of, the world is not completely clear.
Should the judiciary be deprived?
In fact, the 234 articles that were flogged by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nightly, 15-hour Parforce ride are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague formulation and the accompanying legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This suggests at least a newly added article: In all matters concerning Sharia, Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be, but it can mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto result in the decapitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft Constitution is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: Civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts served to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, as it says in the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and promote its morals and values."
This is so vaguely formulated in legal terms that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly states equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it is to be punished remains unclear.
Equally dubious is the phrase that the "insulting of people" is forbidden.
Is that enough for a president's cartoon or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpreting how much in the draft, which Morsi has to sign, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The Revolution Has Returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring down the Charter before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft constitution belongs "to the garbage heap of history".
Via Twitter, he accused the followers of Morsi of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition figure Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organised Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to the area demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafists took part and shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi: "Clean the land!" and affirmed: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have provoked civil war-like conditions.
Obviously, Morsi's followers didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamists' draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights doesn't even happen"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone until February and involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Morsi extended power to all three authorities in the state had the lawyer resigned.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto overrides it," Saeda laments.
But without civil society organisations a democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle for direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: "You are feeding a monster you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for rather smelly fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
You put them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear.
And leave her there for a week.
So about this one has to imagine the nasal stunning smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salted trout, which is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how stinking you would like to have your fish.
When the darkness comes across the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, dedicated to this, well, very impressive specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but also organizes the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk General".
People around us consume small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I'll have some snacks.
If you avoid getting the Rakfisk near your nose, it's not bad - like sushi, which has a rather long bus ride behind you.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities yet and fish was soaked in airtight salt water barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter it was then taken out after long fermentation and consumed - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol dampened senses.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the USA.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not long ago far richer than Norway, immigrants flock.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, though strictly smelling, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't make it into the world press often, and most people don't seem to mind.
Here it is still hated to call Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, one refers only to the "incident of July 22".
Norwegians struggle to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, Norway's current wealth has been largely responsible for the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with mature rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are - as they say - a prudent people.
Your English is immaculate, just like most people here.
We're not very showy, we don't like boasting.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very cautiously - a large part of the industry's income is being invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the Great Depression, everyone threw money that they did not own, Norway kept its purse tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand up for another court - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
A moose burger like that is definitely something else.
But in the evening the stinky fish is on the menu again.
The hotel in which I study is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the severe haze of the whole fish.
Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nieto facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his inauguration, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly poor.
Even on better days, this is an ever-congested city, but on Monday a steel ring was built that shuts off several important traffic routes to the capital and creates chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential bond and take over the nation's leadership.
He's facing a complex task.
Mexico has proven itself economically well under the outgoing Felipe Calderon government, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Pena Nieto served as the governor of his home state of Mexico before moving to the United States.
In this densely populated, extensive part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Inhabitants of the holiday resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represent a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plates with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected the opposition's accusations that the new president lacked substance.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had great plans for the country.
He was an outstanding statesman, but above all he was also someone who could listen.
But on the other hand, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway overpasses and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a decisive urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was engaged to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind on a spot of wasteland near a large landfill.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he did not adequately address the problem of feminicide during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government had closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the staring of the body had already begun.
As her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana looks down at us. It is placed next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, according to the family, that she has been denied until now.
The authorities treated me like I was a chatterer, a troublemaker, a snitch.
They want their verdict simply to be accepted and kept quiet.
"But this is not possible if there were so many formal errors and omissions," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bond on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take particular care of this problem during his term in office.
"I hope that as President he is as he was as Governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
The prosecutor claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecutor's office contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he was mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks to dismiss the prosecution on the grounds of too harsh conditions of detention
The Private of the U.S. Army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor's office tried to find out on Friday that the Army Private Bradley Manning - charged with the greatest disclosure of confidential information in American history - missed several occasions to complain about the allegedly suffered abuse in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Mannings during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that documents relating to weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month term in Quantico, Virginia did not have any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to dismiss the prosecution - Manning had already been adequately punished by the hard time in prison - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officers had filled out after meeting Manning during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he had been serving from July 2010 to April 2011 under increased conditions of detention.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards to be "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole to be "very professional".
According to Fein, the forms did not contain any complaints about abuse, although officers had asked Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they had to deal with them, but that they had not been recorded.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything," says Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to have his observation status downgraded to "prevention of injuries".
The military claimed that it had assigned this restrictive status - one level below the suicide risk - to its protection and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and to get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and had passed out due to the heat.
Not being allowed to know what was happening to him or to the outside world was a burden.
"My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said that he had tried to keep moving, because by day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards couldn't see his face, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Manning.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Military Prison.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep one night naked in his cell in Quantico and have to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
During the interview on Friday, Manning claimed that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning had told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his underpants or flip flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experiences and drastically reduce his prison sentence if he is convicted at his trial in the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser offences, while other charges, which are considered too extreme, are to be challenged.
The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all of the highest security precautions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence on the Internet, transmission of national defence information and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he is threatened with life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when perplexity spread in me.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called Mexicans all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I chose "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I don't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues you would expect when the heads of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans today are equally likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he did not give any details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought about the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leaders to leave more than half of their territory to them, with a gun held in their hands.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
So, as soon as a U.S. government official makes even the mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears complaints - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - about how the Americans oppress the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the war path.
Yet Mexico’s greatest challenge lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or grandparents - was offered no chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may have now lived the American dream, attended good schools and got good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly true of the United States.
We are also aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our gang to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans resent them.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they are neither part of the country nor of the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we're seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through this alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge about how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual debt assignments, countless buildings were laid in ruins, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza have been struck near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems far from appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the hard-boiled on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though its group itself has suffered great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are being impounded in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders might conclude that they have the time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a resurgent, regional power once regarded as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken on the Hamas side - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Celebrating Hamas supporters believe that there is an Islamist crescent around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist character could face the fall of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And especially the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populous and important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is closely associated with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that even Israel and the United States cannot push out.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
Militaryly, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli anti-missile system, "Iron Dome," has proved its worth and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
For at least a while Israel will be able to sleep calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remains steadfast in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has been doing well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide bombers, not least thanks to the blockades that have led to the West Bank and thus to the major part of a possible Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal under international law, but are being further developed.
Netanyahu is in good shape. His Likud party joined an even more militant group under Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 elections.
Why do these deceitful Palestinians also coddle and leave them with their own state?
If they really had control of the West Bank, would they not, like their fellow Gazans, fire missiles?
No, it's better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab spring could make a dash for them.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economies.
The fact that pragmatic President Morsi and Barack Obama joined forces to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolise the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more in the long term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps towards democratisation, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly take its diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The right answer is that represented by the more rational representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states where Israel is ceding territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, now has to stop arms deliveries to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by an exchange of territories and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must play its part in encouraging Israel to negotiate.
During his first term in office, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he is also averse to participation.
But that is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
And this includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian legislation on uniform cigarette packaging enters into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and infants and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font, is from Saturday.
Australia is thus introducing the world's most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
This is based on studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 will not start smoking with 99% probability even after that.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws favoured the black market trade, resulting in cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed two months ago at the Australian Supreme Court to challenge the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale businesses and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
According to experts, the catch lies in the popularity of social media with exactly the population group to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from TV advertising, barred them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most traders to stop interpreting cigarettes in stores. Now, tobacco advertising has switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Anyone who markets tobacco and has only a small area left to advertise their products cannot get around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a healthcare researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noticed an increase in experience reports on brands written by "normal people."
One has to ask oneself the question: Is this just a private person who finds so much pleasure in marlboro cigarettes that she even records a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries is doing major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to issue photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring her.
"You just take a tilt and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box with a photo printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made filling up of its shelves more difficult.
"It used to take me an hour to sort in a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have simply banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we'll close up," he adds visibly furiously.
In a constantly electrified world, it's nice to be bored sometimes
I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to worry about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts claim boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This force forces the brain to lose itself in interesting ways of thinking, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen these days, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
Should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that one more time.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), does not see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti over boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience of "doing a satisfactory job but not being able to do it".
Boredom is therefore different from apathy in that the person is not busy but wants to be.
In apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disturbing of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only passing slowly".
Boredom can almost sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored persons see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed persons see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Boredom under the Aspects of Attention", which appeared in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, could not find any reason for them and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
Trying to focus on a difficult or exhausting task can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, one engages in monotonous activity - "just like the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help to not feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that scribbling and scribbling, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even combat it by keeping people more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to play around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a booming loudspeaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale for susceptibility to boredom".
On the scale, there are statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys get bored more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a rather tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents with a pager seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored at school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored when they were not at school.
But only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson says he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is certain that "young people are felt to be particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have much influence on their daily routine.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall prey to gambling or drugs in order to alleviate them - this has been shown by studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best right now.
If you're bored and you use this energy to play the guitar and cook, you'll be happy.
But while television can provide happiness in the short term, it can evaporate in the long term.
So if you're going to give your bored child an iPad, you can stop it from boredom. However, it didn't learn to entertain or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control is transferred from one situation to the other."
The child not only learns to talk, but also gets more self - control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of them.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant flow of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we often have to be bored, but boredom is the agonizing, constant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth people are only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with once the noise has stopped."
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for a crime in the southeast of Colorado that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few marijuana chunks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and drug supplies - cavalier's crimes, each with a fine of $100 - and received a court appointment.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco says.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the response to hundreds of minor drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misdemeanours dealing with marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer persecute adults over 21 years of age for small possessions. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative counties of Colorado have announced that they will continue to prosecute and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, Chief of Police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug, with a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, Colorado is, in any case, ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, where the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for personal consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well-suited for guidance," says Brian E. Smith, Spokesman of the Spirits Authority in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and thus also constitutes the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified during this time - for example, how to agree on the government's "reasonable access" to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent an email to his staff in Aurora saying that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana crimes in people over 21 years of age, and that the police would "as of now" not seek criminal charges for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban regulations to regulate medical marijuana growers and continue to persecute drug traffickers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck holds a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mainly to get consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to answer for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute offences that were committed at the time of the crime," Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are ambivalent even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending property proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the very beginning that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the contradictory reactions across the state brought a profound dissension among local officials with regard to the great green experiment.
District prosecutors are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants in court for marijuana crimes and acts as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting people for the fact that they still cannot accept legalisation," he believes.
The first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol are Colorado and Washington as national models for legalizing drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several sensational arrests of medical marijuana consumers and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama administration, believes that although criminal officers will probably not enter doors to confiscate smaller amounts of drugs, they will probably be reluctant to tolerate the legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local community administrations approved moratoria for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six-month ban that would probably be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this amendment to the law.
We depend on what the community has chosen and not on what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It had always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once thought was the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposion that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my arrival at Worscester College at the end of the eighties - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcases again and thus caused the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed into tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
The author A N Wilson shamily declared that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason - a reason that seemed all the more narrow and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: my father Woodrow Wyatt, who had since died, had been an important advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I support the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate right students is suffering similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College state that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They call for a place on the equal rights committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was aggravated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the University of Oxford's Conservative Student Association, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and flaunted with a silver suit and a silver-set walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are regarded as "sin rams for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Conservative Students' Association of Nottingham University, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing trend towards the left in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the application for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-designate of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, says she has observed a growing rejection of moderate right students among JCR members.
"This poses a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university had voted not to award Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have made even Stalinists startle.
In the first days of the first semester week, during which new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a foretaste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even gladly took part in it.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatisation and the government's rejection of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate 18th-century French texts into English. I had not been prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and pretty ugly.
"Do Thatcher followers want to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes, tears were coming up.
"I suggest you take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was sitting alone in college at dinner when someone tipped me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory will be harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first-semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to pretend.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically attended Eton College, which was considered conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one of them asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt as homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay ahead of me extended before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who was based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty and rejected it for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open - minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do anything like that, not in my city of dreamy spires.
Even my Communist friends always showed impeccable manners.
His wet eyes were clouding.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure you're just being teased.
It would break my heart if you left.
Tired by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory's followers, had yielded to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, during which another history tutor had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly fell into shame, I admitted that my parents had given me a "brainwash" and called it "old fools."
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my rabbits gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You're welcome to call me a whiny wimp.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was recognised by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of Haute Couture have been put together, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stifling and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3rd, there are a large number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashionmaker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't show their tilts on your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a Valentino dress
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music one recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," recalls the "Top Model", which began its career at the Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
"He never gets out of fashion because his designs are artworks," she concludes.
Fashion Show of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good upbringing and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60-meter-long catwalk that proposes a role-change: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather belonging to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls shine names such as that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit von Norway, Rosario von Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion designer, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the fall/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the ex-duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leader in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamt of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to pass.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a cleavage that honors its name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion designer "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite clouded, Valentino is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honour, garavani cumulates as many honors as each of the husbands of his customers.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last month at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was immaculate; time leaves no trace of him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health if they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky roads.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by bringing sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it must climb down to the bottom of its crater every day, where the sulphurous gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping paths of stone.
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 metres, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb at turtle speed, keeping their balance and carefully taking their steps so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulphur they mine.
Arriving at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiresome heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been exploiting the volcanic deposits since 1960 and (never better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"As we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," Anto explains, who usually makes three distances a day.
For each track he needs three hours, after which he is completely done, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
But what looks like a miserable reward for such a sheer inhumane effort is three times what he would earn with field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day at the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I took her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at risk at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left the first traces on him, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other beams and gets up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluishly in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanised sulphur mining in order to save costs and does not supply any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid for by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera, which the guardians of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) require from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human gurneys.
"This work is for animals and not for humans," says Madrusin, a sturdy 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as possible" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners are stuck in the thick columns rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With a basket on his back, Unainik with his 53 years is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari at a distance of 18 kilometers.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, missing some teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest also works as a sulfur carrier at the age of 30.
Time is passing, but poverty keeps generation to generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as human vices on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame the fact that they don't have children on the career, stress and cost of real estate and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems implausible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mints, but nevertheless - or precisely because of this - they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper's song, the local sayings such as "Sliding a "bao" (Laib) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, keeps the hope that the commercial will reach in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their "national duty."
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world when it comes to planting, so we realized that it was a subject that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we make something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue lightly are the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has made it possible for people to have much more options in terms of life goals and priorities besides getting married and making a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of singles and to the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the reduction of the population has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore ruling party has achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Department of Urban Development has begun to monitor the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living space of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person and that they deter construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards provide clearer orientations for developers who have previously been hindered if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they will not have much impact.
"People are stressed out, homes and education are expensive, which is why many put it off," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women cite their careers, the stress and the cost of property and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - there is still so much the government can do.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What's private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes himself to when he exposes situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the Internet.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very personal" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"I wouldn't reveal my deepest secrets in a post," says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I'm also spending my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, nudes, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures us that he knows 35 friends he has in FB and nine in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone will answer me, I'll just upload them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
When asked, he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommends a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has hinted to him or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone pushes me or demands it from me, I simply remove it from my account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unknown to experiences known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's friend was blackmailed into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who did it," he assures.
According to José, the victim didn't close the account.
"He just did it privately."
He then explains a number of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, that's what I'd do if I didn't like him or if I wanted to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and young people, it is necessary to understand that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information; however, with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University, and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants", shaped these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them when we are still learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we require them to have a defined criterion on what can be disseminated, published or said, at an age where maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be selective when it is important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to have a photo of you published, like the one you published from a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Did you ask permission from the other people when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them understanding that they need to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educator consultant, comments that it is essential for parents to read through the guidelines of social networks carefully.
When they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You shall not speak to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was to be signed theoretically by the seven governments present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the exam, but then stated that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian government's website.
On questions relating to the text, they stated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day in the press room only the picture of the presidential meeting was transmitted without sound with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The few information circulating among journalists was received from the press representatives of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, causing discomfort among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the presidential office of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the Humala Declaration and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South America - Arab States (ASPA) Summit, and on this occasion, despite the press's strong request, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not published either.
On the official ASPA website, you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists were in place, but to a large extent they restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice which resolves a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which begins in The Hague on Monday, in the trial that Lima initiated against Santiago, to hear the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are currently presenting to this International Court of Justice," said Humala along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
Both presidents confirmed that they would submit to the ICJ after Colombia filed a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
The summit was attended by the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 following the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, in which it announced that 16 decisions were taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for a total investment of 17 billion dollars.
Regarding the decisions taken, he said that the Unasur countries "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we will extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, and to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America, and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant traits, but rather serve to expand our production capacity and to show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects designed to improve spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-out statement.
Among these projects would be five Peruvians, who would be on the cross-axis of their territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which would provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations" from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he was expecting a meeting with his counterpart in Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, in order to treat the maritime conflict respectfully according to a judgment called into question by Bogotá.
"Maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also requires talks with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilised and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the new President of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the Block also met in advance to adopt the action plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is presided over by the regional bloc.
"South America must learn to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, whereby "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II and other conflicts" and "are now practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that would drive the member states of Unasur forward.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, must be achieved; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States," he said as an allusion to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa affirmed that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there had been "reasoned suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that its proceedings would not be complied with."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to interrogate him on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish jurisprudence allowed this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out via the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that there was a risk that the health and mental condition of Assange would be impaired.
"Since he was in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of state of Ecuador.
However, there was a danger that he would take physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow room and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect everyone's health," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London since June was the granting of a free letter allowing him to travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, conducts a series of proceedings at various European authorities," he said.
And "if Britain grants this leave tomorrow, I think it's done."
And when Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish case law allows and has done in other cases, the problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate were "the mediocrity, the evil intention, and the lie that invalidated freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek and extort profit," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador would no longer be dominated by such journalists "and would not be dominated by bankers or hegemonic and bourgeois countries," and anticipated that in a re-election he "will deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and not allow any opportunistism and no coup d'état disguised as legal" because it "destructed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
Moreover, the President of Ecuador considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, that favored the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, "absolutely entitled."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in pursuit of a common path.
They must be comprehensively treated so that they can be overcome and looked ahead.
He also trusted in a good settlement of disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to call international authorities if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh."
With regard to the possibility that he would stand as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador in order to achieve his third mandate in a row, he stated that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa stated that if he lost the February 2013 elections, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to shoulder this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I retire from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he travelled there for a planned, routine treatment, and that he would be expected to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS is a late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with the results: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb struck," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor "tried to weaken" without any apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to find out about it, with such dedication that he was celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who do not know about their disease and where the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after AIDS appeared in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient taking up treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of HCG HIV unit, saying that this information was supported by a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
Andrade Villanueva, a specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, commented that since 2008, scientists concluded that although AIDS is not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system at the start of treatment, and that those who are not addicted to drugs would have greater chances: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive the diagnosis HIV-positive at the age of 25 can, in this sense, "get 75 years of age without problems as long as they are under control," said this expert.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA annual report), it is nevertheless true that 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have died since the publication of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and by May of this year, 187 have died, but it is assured that universal access to antiretroviral medicines has been available since 2005.
- So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that the people come in a very advanced state because they do not know their infection state, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality, more early diagnoses are required, which is why all those who need this need to be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal is approved by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (National Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by the patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test performed at a private laboratory, for the sole reason that it had been made by a friend of his who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I prefer to burst three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the drugs.
All his parents know today is that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot of work, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio notes, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the worldwide AIDS Day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken care of the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; they were handed over individually earlier, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk of new infections.
"What do you need it for?" is a common question of ridicule by social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, which young people do not want to expose themselves to, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be not only behind the counter, but in delivery devices in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he put it to the point.
Key Data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
Nationally, the state ranks fourth in terms of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in terms of HIV.
92% of contagion occurs via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it for each registered case.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities achieved through a trade transaction in Mexico, a sinister precedent is created for any national company with subsidiaries in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
So it could be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Court on 15 June for the northern district of Texas means that Mexican companies are helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States over three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first says that the main proceedings are the trade transaction dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings for companies with cross-border profiles is not known.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, using the American Law Institute as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies after the recognition of the debts in the bankruptcy fund that Vitro's branches had with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also true that, after the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained to the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which struck the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objects to the same court of appeal, so that the vote is taken in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not allowed, the Cerciorare objection is filed, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the court dropped a document sent by the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), describing the proceedings carried out by Vitro under the Trade Concourses Act, and pointing out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After several months of failure by the Mexican Air Traffic Unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores has finally made progress.
The petition, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the central administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from Bank IXE's F/589 trust account under the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
Prior to this, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has managed to unite the governors in the south-east to oppose the monumental establishment, which partly destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government failed to comply with a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement known as ACTA, the matter has already been archived in accordance with the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is launching over 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that promise to pay interest every 28 days.
Creation of Competition
Formed from NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The globetrotter of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and has travelled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of basketball in the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being confined to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, be it as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, agent and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"All my life I put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time with the vaqueros from the mid-fifties as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as co-executor or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as managing director, co-executor or coach.
It was many fulfilling years, including the five successive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mancy's debut at BSN.
From then on, Cuco took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," Reyes says.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked as a coach here and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong and 2 m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had made a Bayamon championship possible, Gausse would provide another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, which should have been bronze, if it had not been for this Canadian referee, who let us repeat the last turn for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the Pan American team in Cuba in 1991 where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
The team included not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blocked players because of the incidents at the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level like Piculín.
And this without considering his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill from the boys.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the bandage?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
For example, that the boys in Ponce play only in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for trainers, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes I go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas to celebrate Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died at the Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray explained in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Magnificent Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also an actor of two comedies that were broadcast only for a short time, such as The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His films included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the adorable detestable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of CBS television series about the Ewing-Clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", which was supposed to create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.

When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most popular entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had got her pregnant and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but others had reasons to want him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) admitted.
"I know what to say on the tombstone of J.R.," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, co-actor of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and outside the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshipers in the world, and it remains in our hearts for those who have been lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success on TV channel TNT a few months ago.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was being filmed, the station informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how the loss of Hagmann would be dealt with in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the air force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I thought might harm or harm someone in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he campaigned for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are near and after," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of the course studying the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar's "long back count" on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place of which the Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told the students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If someone analyses what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which should be the last in history.
In Temple, associate professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course called "The End of the World".
"We don't take in 2012 so we always keep the option of being able to re-start the course in case the world doesn't go down," said Restall.
Despite the "foreseeable demise", students have to study, create projects and take final examinations.
In Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than "to continue working until night when the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more seats," said Restall about his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students asking if there were any seats left.
The students for their part assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old Rutgers-Camden student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a matter of comfort or its absence.
25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Nursing explains to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less a professor - said they believed in the last date of December 21st.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in certain ways we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, last year's student at Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that goes back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"People don't think that way elsewhere," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an allusion to an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restal pointed out that over the years many days were spoken of by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophised that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebration about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
